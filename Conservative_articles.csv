0,Biden knocks Trump before surveying Puerto Rico hurricane damage,Steven Nelson,2022-10-03,"President Biden jabbed at his predecessor, Donald Trump, Monday before heading to Puerto Rico to examine damage caused by Hurricane Fiona last month — telling reporters the island was not “taken very good care of” following Hurricane Maria in 2017. “I’m heading to Puerto Rico because they haven’t been taken very good care of,” Biden said as he left the White House, with more than 100,000 homes in the US territory still without power two weeks after Fiona struck as a Category 1 storm. “They’ve been trying like hell to catch up from the last hurricane,” the president added. “I want to see the state of affairs today and make sure we push everything we can.” Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico with devastating Category 4 winds eight months after Trump took office. His subsequent visit was best remembered for the former reality TV host throwing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of locals as if they were souvenirs. The post-Maria recovery was marred by alleged corruption and inefficiency, including by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. More than 10 million water bottles provided by FEMA to the territorial government were left unused on an airport tarmac and PREPA awarded a $300 million no-bid contract to rebuild the island’s electric grid to a small Montana company linked to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The contract was canceled amid scrutiny. A former FEMA official pleaded guilty this year to accepting bribes from a different electric company that was given $1.8 billion in contracts to rebuild infrastructure. Yet another electric company, LUMA Energy, which is co-owned by Houston-based and Canadian firms, took over Puerto Rico’s electrical grid last year. But the contract outraged critics because it was negotiated secretly and followed by blackouts. “LUMA can go to hell,”  reggaeton star Bad Bunny said in July, supporting critics of the latest electric deal. “The country belongs to us. We are the ones who have the control.” FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell was asked Monday by a reporter about Biden’s criticism of Trump as she traveled aboard Air Force One to Puerto Rico. “We know that there may have been some issues in the previous administration,” Criswell said. “We are laser focused on giving them the support they need. That’s what my job is. That’s what the president has directed me to do.” Trump defended his performance and blamed local officials including then-Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who had said of Trump, “If the bully gets close, I’ll punch the bully in the mouth.”  “Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being and I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it,” Trump said in 2019. “You have the mayor of San Juan [Carmen Yulín Cruz] that, frankly, doesn’t know what she’s doing and the governor, they have to spend the money wisely. They don’t know how to spend the money and they’re not spending it wisely.” Trump’s administration outraged congressional Democrats by slowly dispersing $43 billion in appropriated Hurricane Maria recovery aid — doling out just one-third of the sum in two years, in part due to new anti-corruption oversight restrictions. “Why is Puerto Rico always subjected to different standards when it comes to this [Trump] administration?” Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-NY) objected at the time. Alleged corruption on the island has plagued local politicians affiliated with both the Democratic and Republican parties. Former Gov. Wanda Vazquez Garced, a Republican in office from 2019-2021, was arrested last year by the FBI for allegedly accepting a banker’s bribe in exchange for demanding the resignation of the island’s commissioner of financial institutions. Her predecessor Rosselló, a Democrat, left office in 2019 amid protests over the revelation of group messages on the platform Telegram that included insults about public figures and insider information shared with lobbyists. The Rosselló administration’s education minister and health insurance administrator were busted by the FBI in 2019 for alleged corruption including theft of government funds. Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has laid blame for Puerto Rico’s slow post-Maria recovery partially on poor local leadership. “I stand with the people of Puerto Rico in their fight against corruption and join them in calling for the immediate resignation of Governor Rosselló,” Sanders tweeted in 2019. “Puerto Rico deserves a governor who is accountable, transparent, and capable of leading the island to recovery after Hurricane Maria, which was almost two years ago. The federal government must provide full support in this effort.” In addition to issues with corruption, HBO host John Oliver, whose program is popular among young adults and Democrats, and Puerto Rican-American “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, focused in a 2015 episode on the fact that the territory saddled itself with debt by raising money through bond sales and then was restricted from restructuring that debt by federal law. Congress passed a law in 2016 allowing for a debt restructuring board, which slashed the island’s $70 billion debt nearly in half.

The funding comes from Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The funds will be used to strengthen flood walls, repair levees and create a flood warning system.First lady Jill Biden and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will also join President Biden on the trip. According to a White House official, the Bidens will meet with impacted families, participate in a community service project and thank officials who are working to help damaged areas of Puerto Rico recover.While touting the White House's measures to assist Puerto Rico, an official said that the Biden administration removed ""onerous restrictions"" from the Trump administration that made it difficult for Puerto Rico to access relief funds.""The Biden-Harris Administration also removed onerous restrictions put in place by the last Administration restricting Puerto Rico’s ability to access nearly $5 billion in additional funds, including for critical recovery and reconstruction needs,"" the official said.Hurricane Fiona made landfall on Sept. 18, causing an island-wide power outage. Throughout Hurricane Fiona, Puerto Rico experienced multiple blackouts, flooding and extensive damage. At one point, over 1 million people in Puerto Rico had no electricity or gas days after the storm. The Ponce region was hit particularly hard by the storm, where thousands of residents still have no power, according to the Puerto Rican government.Puerto Rico has devastated by natural disasters in recent years, especially from Hurricane Maria in 2017. One reason why is because of the island's poor infrastructure for handling storms, which the White House hopes to solve.Despite federal relief efforts, the Puerto Rican government reportedly struggles to pay its debts to contractors. An Oklahoma-based energy company says that the Puerto Rican government still owes them $365 million for restoring the island's devastated power grid after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The now-defunct Puerto Rico Electric and Power Authority (PREPA) has reportedly not settled the issue with Mammoth Energy.After his trip to Puerto Rico, President Biden plans to visit Florida on Wednesday to witness damage and recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/president-biden-visit-puerto-rico-announce-60m-plan-help-territory-recover-hurricane-fiona,Fox,Conservative

Ian caused catastrophic damage across a large swath of Florida and killed scores before exiting into the Atlantic and then heading up the coast before making landfall again in South Carolina as a downgraded post-tropical storm. The White House said additional details about the visit would be released later. But the president, speaking at a Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner on Saturday, addressed the damage caused by Fiona and Ian. “Our hearts … are heavy, the devastating hurricanes, storms in Puerto Rico, Florida, and South Carolina. And we owe Puerto Rico a hell of a lot more than they’ve already gotten,” he said.

2,"Andrew Cuomo returns to public eye, joins Puerto Rico aid effort in Bronx","Georgia Worrell, Rich Calder",2022-10-01,"Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo made his first public appearance Saturday since recently announcing his return to public life, showing up in the Bronx to join a relief effort for Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Fiona. “I want to say to the people of Puerto Rico that the people of New York State are with you always, on good days and bad days; we have your back because we are family,” crowed Cuomo, sounding like he was still in office. “Whatever Puerto Rico needs, New York is going to be here to help you.” Cuomo, who resigned under fire more than a year ago amid a sexual harassment scandal, was joined by clergy leaders, community leaders, former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and ex-Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr. He spent about an hour along Southern Boulevard in Hunts Point helping load a truck with food and supplies that will be sent to the island often called New York City’s “sixth borough.” Cuomo showed up in response to a tweet Diaz Sr. posted last week asking for help with “humanitarian” efforts for Puerto Rico’s flood victims. The ex-governor on Saturday also donated $2,500 to help the former councilman to buy a van to send to Puerto Rico to assist with the relief efforts. Cuomo has remained allies with Diaz Sr. even though the ex-councilman and pastor has a long history of irritating other fellow Democrats by making controversial remarks about the gay community. Cuomo didn’t directly address his own future. However, when asked later if Cuomo is eying a return to public office, his spokesman Rich Azzopardi cryptically said:  “Who knows what the future holds? But the governor made his immediate plans known to the public last week. “Today was all about Puerto Rico and helping our fellow Americans.” Azzopardi was referring to an eight-minute video  the three-term Democratic governor released Wednesday. In it, Cuomo said he plans to start a political action committee “to elect the right people to politics” — without naming names. He also said he plans to start a gun-control group and his own weekly podcast.

3,Mayor Adams flies to Puerto Rico to help hurricane-hit isle,David Meyer,2022-09-25,"There’s no rest for the weary. Mayor Eric Adams left a political storm at home over everything from border migrants to rising crime to spend his Sunday helping what he calls New York’s “sixth borough,” hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. Adams traveled to the island late Saturday night for what he framed as a fact-finding mission to see how New York City can best help the island recover from Hurricane Fiona. “Puerto Rico is our sixth borough of New York. We’re tied at the hip,” Hizzoner said during in a video shot Sunday morning alongside San Juan Mayor Miguel Romero. “We’re going to… identify exactly what’s needed,” the mayor said. “We want to pinpoint what the needs are.” Romero replied that his city needs electricity to provide its citizens with water. The two mayors appeared in the clip alongside US Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-Manhattan/Bronx), Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, several New York City Council members and city Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Adams, who announced his trip last week, said in a video posted from the plane that he was headed to the island “to help our brothers and sister on the ground” — as his administration back home faces persistent crime, a massive migrant crisis and a hefty challenge to its vaccine mandate for city employees. In addition to meeting Romero, Adams’ schedule Sunday also was set to include meetings with Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, the regional administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the president of the Dominican Republic. Adams — whose meetings Sunday were closed to the media — has not taken questions from reporters, outside of TV and radio interviews, since announcing plans to build tent encampments to house immigrant asylum seekers as the months-long influx from the southern border has overwhelmed city shelters. He faced another significant blow Friday when a state supreme court judge ordered NYPD members who refused their COVID-19 vaccination to be reinstated. Any vaccination requirement must be negotiated as part of officers’ collective bargaining agreement, Judge Lyle Frank ruled.

1,Puerto Rico still owes company $350 million for restoring grid in 2017 as it faces fresh hurricane outages,Thomas Catenacci   ,2022-09-23,"An Oklahoma-based energy company has repeated calls for the Puerto Rican government to complete a payment for work it did restoring the island's power grid years ago.Mammoth Energy said the Puerto Rico Electric and Power Authority (PREPA), the now-defunct government agency that previously oversaw the territory's power grid and transmission infrastructure, still owes about $365 million for a contract the company was awarded in 2017. PREPA awarded the company's subsidiary, Cobra Acquisitions, contracts worth $1.6 billion to restore Puerto Rico's decimated grid following Hurricane Maria.The company, which has worked on 17 other natural disaster clean up projects, was ultimately owed a total of $1.3 billion after completing its work and departing earlier than expected in 2019. When Cobra workers left the island, PREPA still owed $224 million, an amount which has swelled to more than $360 million when factoring in interest.""We treated it almost like a military action which it was,"" Mammoth Energy CEO Arty Straehla told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""At one point, we had 1,000 people on the island that were working to restore electricity because the devastation was so bad. When we got down there, 100% of the island was down."" ""It was one of the most devastating things that I've seen,"" he continued.Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and surrounding islands in mid-September 2017, severely devastating the island's power grid, medical services and utilities like running water. While the hurricane initially killed dozens of Puerto Ricans, a Harvard University study estimated that in its aftermath, it caused another 4,645 deaths. The National Centers for Environmental Information reported that the storm caused $107.1 billion in damage, making it the third-costliest U.S. storm on record. The Bipartisan Budget Act, which former President Trump signed into law in February 2018, provided $2 billion to restore Puerto Rico's grid and nearly $90 billion in total for disaster relief after a series of storms, including Hurricane Maria.Less than a month after Cobra signed the contract with PREPA in October 2017, the company sent multiple barges full of equipment and hundreds of workers to Puerto Rico to fix the grid.""We went down, went through all the adversity,"" Straehla said. ""We ended up taking our own lodging down there because we didn't want to take away from the resources of the island. So, we took barges down there where our men could be housed offshore."" ""They'd go out and work 16-hour days and then come back.""Cobra completed its work and departed Puerto Rico in March 2019, according to Straehla. He said the company had successfully executed its job, restoring the island's electricity, and was lauded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).The RAND Corporation, a research and analysis firm, issued a report for FEMA after the company completed its work, saying the contract was fairly priced. The report did not analyze whether Cobra properly implemented the contract.""Cobra's billable rates to PREPA fall within those representative ranges and are therefore reasonable for the emergency repair work performed by Cobra,"" the report concluded.Straehla, though, said that PREPA, which was provided taxpayer funds via FEMA, has been in violation of its contract since his firm completed its work.He added the agency filed for bankruptcy shortly after Hurricane Maria, and Mammoth Energy has been involved in those court proceedings. PREPA's assets were sold to private sector firm LUMA Energy.However, Straehla said Mammoth Energy has been financially impacted by the alleged contract violation. The company has been forced to shed hundreds of workers as a result of the situation.""It had a tremendous impact on us — it certainly changed the trajectory of the company,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""We want to get paid, we want to reinvest, we want to build more jobs, and continue to grow this company.""""For a company our size, $365 million makes a dramatic difference in our trajectory.""In a statement, FEMA spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said the agency continues to fund emergency and permanent work in Puerto Rico related to Hurricane Maria. He also noted FEMA has awarded more than $11 billion in federal funding for these needs, adding that the Puerto Rican government is required to ensure certain requirements are met when issuing grants.""Prior to using FEMA funds, the Government of Puerto Rico and its subrecipients must ensure grant program requirements are met,"" Edwards told Fox News Digital. ""FEMA commends the Government of Puerto Rico’s development of strong accounting and fiscal management practices put in place since 2017 to ensure appropriate use of federal funds.""FEMA does not have the authority to force PREPA to complete payments to contractors and subcontractors.Straehla's pleas for PREPA to complete its payments to his firm come as Puerto Rico faces fresh devastation after Hurricane Fiona slammed into the island this week.

4,Biden says ‘we really are’ ready to help Puerto Rico in tweak of Reagan’s famous maxim,Steven Nelson,2022-09-22,"President Biden on Thursday proposed updating Ronald Reagan’s famously cynical view of government — telling New York leaders that authorities “really are” going to help the victims of Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico. “We’re surging federal resources to Puerto Rico,” Biden said at a briefing in Lower Manhattan. “And we’ll do everything, everything we can to meet the urgent needs you have and we know they’re real and they’re significant. And we’re there. And I know, bad joke, ‘I’m from the federal government and I’m here to help.’ But we really are.” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams attended the event at the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s office in One World Trade Center. Biden said Thursday he was ordering the federal government to reimburse 100% of Puerto Rico’s expenses for “debris removal, search and rescue, power and water restoration, and shelter and food for a month.” The president took no questions from reporters during the FEMA stop and didn’t answer a shouted inquiry about whether he plans to visit Puerto Rico. The storm made landfall Sunday as a category one hurricane and knocked out power to the entire island. Biden sought to demonstrate a hands-on approach to the hurricane aftermath after his predecessor Donald Trump faced criticism for the pace of humanitarian and rebuilding efforts after the much more powerful category four storm Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017. Reagan made his famous pronouncement on government at a 1986 press conference while specifically addressing economic issues for farmers — rather than emergency response efforts. “I’ve always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help,'” Reagan said. “A great many of the current problems on the farm were caused by government-imposed embargoes and inflation, not to mention government’s long history of conflicting and haphazard policies.” ",https://nypost.com/2022/09/22/biden-says-we-really-are-ready-to-help-puerto-rico-in-tweak-of-reagan/,New York Post,Conservative
5,Parts of Puerto Rico stranded four days after Hurricane Fiona pummels island,Associated Press,2022-09-22,"CAGUAS, Puerto Rico — Hurricane Fiona left dozens of families stranded across Puerto Rico after smashing roads and bridges, with authorities still struggling to reach people four days after the storm smacked the U.S. territory, causing historic flooding. For now, government officials are working with religious groups, nonprofits and others braving landslides, thick mud and broken asphalt by foot to provide food, water and medicine for people in need, but they are under pressure to clear a path so vehicles can enter isolated areas soon. Nino Correa, commissioner for Puerto Rico’s emergency management agency, estimated that at least six municipalities across the island had areas that were cut off by Fiona, which struck as a Category 1 hurricane and was up to Category 4 power Wednesday as it headed toward Bermuda. Living in one of those areas is Manuel Veguilla, who has not been able to leave his neighborhood in the north mountain town of Caguas since Fiona swept in on Sunday. “We are all isolated,” he said, adding that he worries about elderly neighbors including his older brother who does not have the strength for the long walk it takes to reach the closest community. Veguilla heard that municipal officials might open a pathway Thursday, but he doubted that would happen because he said large rocks covered a nearby bridge and the 10-foot space beneath it. Neighbors have shared food and water dropped off by nonprofit groups, and the son of an elderly woman was able to bring back basic supplies by foot Wednesday, he said. Veguilla said that in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that struck five years ago and resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths, he and others used picks and shovels to clear the debris. But Fiona was different, unleashing huge landslides. “I cannot throw those rocks over my shoulder,” he said. Like hundreds of thousands of other Puerto Ricans after Fiona, Veguilla had no water or electricity service, but said they there is a natural water source nearby. Fiona sparked an islandwide blackout when it hit Puerto Rico’s southwest region, which already was still trying to recover from a series of strong earthquakes in recent years. Some 70% of 1.47 million customers were without power three days after the storm amid an extreme heat alert issued by the National Weather Service. Some 40% of customers, or more than half a million, did not have water service. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent hundreds of additional personnel to help local officials as the federal government approved a major disaster declaration and announced a public health emergency on the island. Neither local nor federal government officials had provided any damage estimates as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the storm, which dropped up to 30 inches of rain in some areas. More than 1,000 people remained in shelters. “Our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico who have endured so much suffering over the last couple of years,” said Brad Kieserman, vice president of operations and logistics at the Red Cross. After Puerto Rico, Fiona pummeled the Dominican Republic and then swiped past the Turks and Caicos Islands as it strengthened into a Category 4 storm. Officials there reported relatively light damage and no deaths, though the eye of the storm passed close to Grand Turk, the small British territory’s capital island, on Tuesday. “God has been good to us and has kept us safe during this period when we could have had a far worse outcome,” Deputy Gov. Anya Williams said. Fiona was forecast to pass near Bermuda early Friday, and then hit easternmost Canada early Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The center said Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph late Wednesday. It was centered about 550 miles southwest of Bermuda, heading north at 10 mph. It was forecast to pass close by Bermuda early Friday. ",https://nypost.com/2022/09/22/parts-of-puerto-rico-inaccessible-days-after-hurricane-fiona/,New York Post,Conservative

The funds also supplement local emergency services that are looking to provide temporary shelter for those displaced by the major storm.""Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,"" Biden said in the declaration. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell named Thomas J. Fargione as the Federal Coordinating Officer to oversee federal recovery operations.The funds aim to help more than 50 municipalities in the U.S. territory.The president said federal funds have also been made available to local governments and some nonprofit organizations via a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation, debris removal and protective measures for all municipalities in the country. Fiona’s 125 mph winds and heavy rain initially left the entire island without power, though some has since been restored. ""Hurricane Fiona has severely impacted electrical infrastructure and generation facilities throughout the island,"" said Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution.The company added: ""We want to make it very clear that efforts to restore and reenergize continue and are being affected by severe flooding, impassable roads, downed trees, deteriorating equipment, and downed lines.""Fiona continues to travel north through the Atlantic Ocean, where it is projected to hit Bermuda and then Canada, mostly missing the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.

6,Drone video after Hurricane Fiona shows Puerto Rico underwater,FOX Weather,2022-09-20,"Hurricane Fiona has dumped tremendous amounts of rain on Puerto Rico, leaving parts of the island underwater. According to the National Weather Service, more than 2 feet of rain is estimated to have fallen across southeastern parts of the island as of Monday morning. Salinas, located on the southeast coast, received more than 18 inches of rain. The town got 2.2 inches of rain in just an hour and wind gusts of 55 mph at the height of the storm, according to the NWS. Aerial footage released by Gobierno Municipal de Añasco captures major flooding in Añasco, Puerto Rico on Monday. Drone video recorded by a storm chaser in Salinas showed block after block of homes and businesses surrounded by water. The streets looked more like canals. The only sight that looked in place was a parking lot filled with boats on trailers that had been flooded, making it look more like a marina. Video from the ground showed an SUV surrounded by water up to the top of its wheel wells. Neighbors who were stuck inside all day Sunday, sheltering from the hurricane, sloshed through streets Monday as they surveyed the damage. Only the reptiles looked comfortable walking the streets. Even as Fiona departed Puerto Rico and crossed over the Dominican Republic, bands of rain continued to dump several inches more on the soaked island. The NWS issued a Flash Flood Warning for Salinas until Monday evening. The storm could still drop 4 to 6 inches of additional rain. “Mudslide and rockfalls are likely in areas of steep terrain,” read the NWS warning about life-threatening flash flooding. “Turn around, don’t drown when encountering flooded roads,” the warning continued. “Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.” Six inches of moving water can make a walker fall, according to the NWS Flood Safety Information page. Six inches of water also reaches the bottom of most cars which can result in stalling and loss of control. A foot of water can float many vehicles, and 2 feet of rushing water can carry away most cars, SUVs and pickups.

7,Hurricane Fiona’s ‘life-threatening’ floodwaters destroy bridge in Puerto Rico,"Hillary Andrews, FOX Weather",2022-09-19,"UTUADO, Puerto Rico – Residents and first responders could only watch helplessly as floodwaters overtook the town’s bridge and washed it downstream. Hurricane Fiona whipped the area with 85 mph winds gusting into the 100s and rainfall between 2 and almost 6 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Puerto Rico is expected to receive several inches of rain through Tuesday, raising concerns about flooding and mudslides. Southern Puerto Rico could see 12-18 inches of rain, with some areas receiving as much as 30 inches of rain. “These rainfall amounts will produce catastrophic, life-threatening flash floods and urban flooding,” tweeted the NHC. Watch the video above as the river rises over the roadway and pulls on the bridge. Then listen to the protesting groans of the metal trying desperately to grip the foundation before being torn free by the force. Almost in slow motion, the bridge is overcome by the rushing waters and heads downstream. The power pulls at the guardrail which lets go of the ground supports one by one. As it follows the bridge, the metal takes out street signs. The rail hits the power pole which shudders in response but stays standing. At the end of the video, it is difficult to tell if the sound from the astonished onlookers is laughing or crying. They are no strangers to this scene though. Hurricane Maria’s floodwaters in 2017 destroyed the original bridge and cut off the mountainous area from civilization, according to a tweet from Congressman Roberto Lefranc Fortuno of Puerto Rico. He wrote: “Temporary Bridge in Utuado, PR-123 has collapsed. This bridge was installed after Hurricane Maria in 2017.” Regional authorities didn’t reach Utuado for 10 days and federal aid took 42 days to arrive, according to PreventionWeb.net, an agency managed by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Maria struck on September 20th and the photo above shows the U.S. Department of Homeland Security delivering food and water to the isolated neighborhoods in mid-October.

8,Hurricane Fiona nears Dominican Republic after pounding Puerto Rico,Associated Press,2022-09-19,"Hurricane Fiona bore down on the Dominican Republic Monday after knocking out the power grid and unleashing floods and landslides in Puerto Rico, where the governor said the damage was “catastrophic.” No deaths have been reported, but authorities in the U.S. territory said it was too early to estimate the damage from a storm that was still forecast to unleash torrential rain across Puerto Rico on Monday. Up to 30 inches was forecast for Puerto Rico’s eastern and southern regions. “It’s important people understand that this is not over,” said Ernesto Morales, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Juan. He said flooding has reached “historic levels,” with authorities evacuating or rescuing hundreds of people across the island. “The damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. Brown water rushed through streets, into homes and even consumed a runway airport in southern Puerto Rico. Fiona also ripped up asphalt from roads and washed away a bridge in the central mountain town of Utuado that police say was installed by the National Guard after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017 as a Category 4 storm. The storm also ripped off the roofs of several homes, including that of Nelson Cirino in the northern coastal town of Loiza. “I was sleeping and saw when the corrugated metal flew off,” he said as he observed how the rain drenched his belonging. Ada Vivian Román, a 21-year-old photography student, said the storm knocked down trees and fences in her hometown of Toa Alta. “I’m actually very anxious because it’s a really slow-moving hurricane,” she said. She said she is also worried about whether the public transportation she relies on to get to her job at a public relations agency will be operating by the time she has to go back to the office. “But I know that I’m privileged compared with other families who are practically losing their homes because they are underwater,” she said. Fiona was centered 50 miles southeast of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph on Sunday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It was moving to the northwest at 9 mph. It hit on the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a Category 3 storm. As authorities continue to assess the damage from Fiona, many wondered when power would be restored. “That’s probably the worst damage there is,” said Tomás Rivera, who co-owns a hotel in the southwest coastal town of El Combate. U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in the U.S. territory as the eye of the storm approached the island’s southwest corner. The blackout that Hurricane Maria caused was blamed for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people in the storm’s sweltering aftermath, with power in some neighborhoods not restored until a year later. Maria was a devastating Category 4 storm that struck on Sept. 20, 2017. Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution, said bad weather, including winds of 80 mph, had disrupted transmission lines on Sunday, leading to “a blackout on all the island.” Health centers were running on generators — and some of those had failed. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said crews rushed to repair generators at the Comprehensive Cancer Center, where several patients had to be evacuated. More than 3,000 homes still have only a blue tarp as a roof, and infrastructure remains weak, including the power grid. Outages remain common, and reconstruction started only recently. “I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” said Danny Hernández, who works in the capital of San Juan but planned to weather the storm with his parents and family in the western town of Mayaguez. The storm pummeled cities and towns along Puerto Rico’s southern coast that have not yet fully recovered from a string of strong earthquakes starting in late 2019. More than 1,000 people with some 80 pets had sought shelter across the island by Sunday night, the majority of them in the southern coast. Fiona was forecast to swipe the Dominican Republic early Monday and then northern Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands with the threat of heavy rain. It could threaten the far southern end of the Bahamas on Tuesday. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Dominican Republic’s eastern coast from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo, and for the Turks and Caicos. Fiona previously battered the eastern Caribbean, killing one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe when floods washed his home away, officials said.

9,Hurricane Fiona makes second landfall in Dominican Republic after lashing Puerto Rico,"Brian Donegan , Steven Yablonski, Fox News",2022-09-19,"After making landfall along the extreme southwestern coast of Puerto Rico on Sunday afternoon, Hurricane Fiona made a second landfall about 12 hours later in the eastern Dominican Republic early Monday morning. Maximum sustained winds for Fiona’s first landfall in Puerto Rico were estimated at about 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. High winds were reported across the island on Sunday, including a 103-mph wind gust in the city of Ponce. Hurricane Fiona was slightly stronger for its second landfall in the Dominican Republic, with maximum sustained winds estimated at about 90 mph – still a Category 1 hurricane. The Punta Cana International Airport clocked a 79-mph wind gust near the time of landfall in the pre-dawn hours of Monday. The entire archipelago of Puerto Rico was plunged into a blackout Sunday afternoon as Hurricane Fiona’s high winds caused severe damage to the U.S. territory’s power grid, which was destroyed by Hurricane Maria about five years ago in October 2017. Nearly 1.5 million customers were without power on Sunday afternoon. According to LUMA Energy – the power company responsible for Puerto Rico – power had been restored to about 100,000 customers as of Monday morning within the municipalities of Toa Alta, Toa Baja, the San Juan metropolitan area, Bayamón and Corozal. In addition to the blackout, torrential rain from Hurricane Fiona has caused “catastrophic flooding” across Puerto Rico, the National Hurricane Center said. The National Weather Service office in San Juan had issued a Flash Flood Emergency for parts of Puerto Rico on Sunday night as the catastrophic flood event was producing 2 to 4 inches of rain per hour. More than 2 feet of rain has already fallen in portions of Puerto Rico, including Ponce and Lago Cerrillos, over the past two days. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico on Sunday ahead of Hurricane Fiona’s arrival. That declaration authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mobilize equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the storm. Some residents of Puerto Rico did not take the storm for granted and used the hours before Fiona’s arrival to stock up on gasoline and other supplies. Hurricane Fiona turned deadly Friday evening after a man was swept away by floodwaters on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe after heavy rainfall. Several islands in the eastern Caribbean also reported roof damage, power outages and flooding. As of Monday morning, Hurricane Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph with higher gusts. Fiona was slowly moving off to the northwest at 8 mph. The center of the hurricane was about 35 miles southeast of Samana in the Dominican Republic. Fiona’s wind and rain impacts will continue to spread across the Dominican Republic through Monday night while the hurricane’s outer rainbands also persist over Puerto Rico into Monday afternoon. A Hurricane Warning has been issued for the coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo, as well as for the Turks and Caicos. A Hurricane Warning means sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected. A Hurricane Watch has been issued for the northern coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Frances Viejo westward to Puerto Plata. A Hurricane Watch means sustained winds of at least 74 mph are possible – in this case, within the next 12 to 24 hours. Tropical Storm Warnings have been issued for Puerto Rico, portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, as well as the southeastern Bahamas. A Tropical Storm Warning means sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph are expected within the next 36 hours. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic from west of Cabo Caucedo to Barahona. A Tropical Storm Watch means sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph are possible within the next 48 hours. Hurricane Fiona will move slowly toward the northwest through Monday night before making a turn toward the north-northwest on Tuesday and eventually a northward turn by Wednesday. According to the FOX Forecast Center, this track will take the center of Hurricane Fiona over the eastern portion of the Dominican Republic through Monday morning, then it will emerge over the southwestern Atlantic on Monday afternoon. Fiona is predicted to pass near or to the east of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday. Some strengthening is expected over the next few days after the hurricane emerges over the southwestern Atlantic, and Fiona is expected to become a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) by Wednesday. Hurricane-force winds (74-plus mph) are currently spreading across portions of the Dominican Republic within the Hurricane Warning area. Tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) will continue on Puerto Rico through Monday morning and over portions of the Dominican Republic within the Tropical Storm Warning area through Monday night. Heavy rain from the outer bands of Hurricane Fiona will continue across Puerto Rico into Monday afternoon. The center of Fiona will persist over the eastern Dominican Republic into Monday afternoon with heavy rainbands then lasting through Monday night. Hurricane Fiona is expected to dump an additional 4 to 6 inches of rain across southern Puerto Rico, with isolated amounts up to 10 inches. Storm totals between 12 and 20 inches are expected, with localized maximum amounts up to 30 inches. In northern portions of Puerto Rico, an additional 1 to 4 inches of rain is likely, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches. That will result in storm totals of 4 to 12 inches, with localized maximum amounts up to 20 inches. According to the National Hurricane Center, the heavy rain will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding, along with mudslides and landslides, across Puerto Rico. Flood Watches remain in effect for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through Monday afternoon. In the northern and eastern Dominican Republic, Hurricane Fiona is forecast to drop an additional 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 8 inches. This will result in storm totals up to 15 inches in the eastern Dominican Republic. Between 1 and 4 inches of rain is predicted for the rest of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The Turks and Caicos are expected to receive 4 to 8 inches of rain from Hurricane Fiona, while the southeastern Bahamas are forecast to pick up 1 to 3 inches of rain. A dip in the jet stream is forecast to move over Florida and the Bahamas early this week, which will provide an opening for Hurricane Fiona to make a northward turn. According to the FOX Forecast Center, confidence has increased in Fiona’s track which will take it near or to the east of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday and then out into the western and central Atlantic – away from Florida and the U.S. East Coast. However, Fiona will intensify as it moves north, potentially into a Category 3 or stronger hurricane, and these high winds will send large waves toward the U.S. East Coast toward the end of the week, increasing the risk of life-threatening rip currents. The various possibilities of Fiona’s track overlaid on the five-day forecast cone of uncertainty are shown on the map below, and you can see there’s good agreement among the computer forecast models. In the central subtropical Atlantic, a weak area of low pressure is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. According to the FOX Forecast Center, some slow development of this system is possible over the next couple of days before environmental conditions become less favorable later this week. This system is expected to generally move northward or northeastward while remaining over the open central subtropical Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center currently gives the system a low chance of development in the next five days. Early to mid-September is the time of the season when sea-surface temperatures are the warmest, upper-level winds relax and drier air is typically not widespread. Unlike recent active years, dry air has been more dominant than usual across the eastern parts of the Atlantic Basin, which has stunted the organization and development of tropical cyclones. August ended without seeing a single tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin for only the second time in the satellite era. During an average year, nine named storms and four hurricanes have typically already formed by now, but so far in 2022, the tally stands at just six named storms and three hurricanes.

10,Javier Baez offers free meals to Hurricane Fiona victims in Puerto Rico,Jared Schwartz,2022-09-19,"Javier Baez is doing his part to help his homeland. The Tigers’ star shortstop is offering free meals to anyone in Puerto Rico impacted by Hurricane Fiona. The storm made landfall on Sunday and has wreaked havoc on the island with what governor Pedro Pierlusi described as “unprecedented” winds. “All those families who are in need of a hot meal can stop by @taquizapr in Toa Baja and we will serve it to you for FREE!!,” Báez posted in Spanish in an Instagram story on Monday. “If your community is affected and you’re in need of a hot meal, you can call 787-665-2323 (Joshua) or stop by @taquizapr and we will make all the arrangements. Blessings to all of you!” Puerto Rico has a history with devastating weather, as Hurricane Maria killed nearly 3,000 people in the territory. Currently, there are no reported deaths from Hurricane Fiona, according to PBS, although up to 22 inches of rain has already fallen in some areas. Puerto Rico’s energy company is working to restore powers to millions who are currently without it, Pierlusi announced Monday. Baez, now 29, was born in the city of Bayamon. He played his first seven-and-a-half seasons with the Cubs — winning the 2016 World Series with the team — before joining the Mets last year at the trade deadline. He then signed a six-year, $140 million contract with Detroit this past offseason and has slashed .241/.283/.394 with 14 home runs and 58 RBIs. “Strength Puerto Rico,” Baez wrote in another post. “I carry you in my mind and heart. We are here for you.” Baez notably plays for the Puerto Rican national team, helping the country to the silver medal in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Mets star Francisco Lindor is close with Baez from their time together on the national team, and was instrumental in bringing Baez to the Mets last season.

7,Puerto Rico braces for Fiona as storm escalates into hurricane before landfall,Anders Hagstrom   ,2022-09-18,"Tropical Storm Fiona formed into a Category 1 hurricane Sunday as it continues to approach landfall on Puerto Rico.Fiona first formed as a tropical storm Thursday, and experts say the storm is likely to strengthen further over the next few days before it hits the island. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the island ahead of the storm, opening up federal resources to both prepare for and respond to damage.More than 660,000 Puerto Ricans were without power as of Sunday afternoon, compared to just 82,000 earlier in the morning.Fiona is the season's sixth named storm and third hurricane, and it has sustained winds of 80 mph and gusts of up to 100 mph, according to forecasters.The Puerto Rican government is warning of flash floods and mudslides as the storm heats up.When first detected, Fiona was located about 580 miles east of the Leeward Islands and moving at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of about 50 mph, according to the Associated Press.Send tips to Anders.Hagstrom@Fox.com, or on Twitter: @Hagstrom_Anders",https://www.foxnews.com/us/puerto-rico-braces-fiona-storm-escalates-hurricane-before-landfall,Fox,Conservative
11,Hurricane Fiona makes landfall in entirely powerless Puerto Rico,Ben Kesslen,2022-09-18,"All of Puerto Rico was without power Sunday as Hurricane Fiona hit the island, bringing with it massive amounts of rain and catastrophic flooding. The storm made landfall at 3:20 p.m. EST on Puerto Rico’s southern coast, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, according to the US National Hurricane Center. “It’s time to take action and be concerned,” Nino Correa, Puerto Rico’s emergency management commissioner, said of the hurricane, which blanketed the entire island with its clouds. The tempest was estimated to dump “historic” levels of rain, up to 25 inches of rain, with most areas seeing between 12 and 16 inches, forecasters said. “These rains will produce life-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain,” the NHC said. Fiona hit shortly after the island’s governor, Pedro Pierluisi, confirmed the mass blackout and activated the National Guard. It was unclear when power would be restored as “current weather conditions are extremely dangerous and are hindering our capacity to evaluate the complete situation,” said Luma, the company that operates the island’s power transmission and distribution. Puerto Rico’s 3.3 million residents might have to wait several days to regain electricity, the company warned. President Biden on Sunday morning made an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico, allowing FEMA to prepare to deal with Fiona’s aftermath. Fiona, then a tropical storm, killed one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe on Friday when his home was washed away by floods. His body was discovered on Saturday. The storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday as it reached sustained winds of 80 mph. The National Weather Service said Saturday that the Blanco River in the island’s southeast is already overflowing and told those who live nearby to flee to higher locations, and other rivers began to crest Sunday. “What worries me most is the rain,” forecaster Ernesto Morales with the NWS said. Public schools and government agencies will be closed on Monday, and Gov. Pierluisi has deployed the country’s national guard. The island’s main airport and its ports were closed Sunday. All health centers and hospitals are running on generators, some of which have already failed, island officials said. The area expected to be hit by the hurricane is still reeling from a string of earthquakes in 2019 that caused significant destruction. Fiona made landfall on the 33rd anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, a Category 3 storm that killed 67 people, including eight in Puerto Rico. It also struck just two days before the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the Category 5 storm that destroyed Puerto Rico’s power grid and killed around 3,000 people. The country’s grid, which has already failed, has remained particularly tenuous since Maria. “I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’ ” said local Danny Hernández. Hernández, who works in San Juan, stocked up at a local supermarket before the storm hit. “After Maria, we all experienced scarcity to some extent,” he said. Fiona is the Atlantic basin’s sixth named storm of the season. The eastern portion of the Dominican Republic is also expected to be badly hit.

The capital, San Juan, “will escape the worst of the wind, but even so, they still could have gusts of 50 plus miles an hour.” Already, 52,000 residents are without power. “But the biggest issue is going to be the rain. It will begin again later today and it’s going to go pretty much right through Monday,” Diamond said. The storm already passed through the island of Guadeloupe — which got 19.46 inches of rain in 24 hours, Diamond said.

13,2 killed by lightning strike while jet skiing in Puerto Rico,"Scott Sistek, FOX Weather",2022-09-06,"SALINAS, Puerto Rico — Two people were killed by a lightning strike while jet skiing in Puerto Rico, according to the National Weather Service. The incident occurred during a thunderstorm around 5:30 p.m. Sunday in Cayo Matias near Salinas. Further details about the two victims have not been released.  A third person was injured. The deaths bring the lightning-related death toll in the U.S. and its territories to 17 in 2022 so far, according to John Jensenius with the National Lightning Safety Council. But it’s the first lightning-related death in Puerto Rico since 2017 and only the fifth since 2006, Jensenius said. However, it’s the 20th and 21st lightning deaths related to boating since 2006, of which eight of those involved jet skis. Jensenius says many lightning fatalities occur from people being outside for extended periods as storms approach or pass nearby and people wait “far too long” to get to a safe place that leaves them in a dangerous and potentially deadly situation. “If you are outside, you are vulnerable to a possible lightning strike,” Jensenius told FOX Weather. He points to their successful safety message: “When thunder roars, go indoors!” “That simple message can save many lives,” he said.  “Chances are that if you are hearing any thunder, even a distant rumble, you’re within striking distance of the storm. Many people don’t understand that lightning can strike more than 10 miles from the rain area in a thunderstorm and that even a distant rumble of thunder should serve as an immediate warning to get inside.” ",https://nypost.com/2022/09/06/2-killed-by-lightning-strike-while-jet-skiing-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
14,"Tropical Storm Earl hits Puerto Rico, Hurricane Danielle stays over Atlantic","Brian Donegan, FOX Weather",2022-09-05,"A quiet August in the tropics has morphed into a busier September with two named tropical disturbances traveling through the Atlantic Ocean: Hurricane Danielle and Tropical Storm Earl. Of the two, Earl is having more current impact as it continues to swirl far off the coasts of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands on Monday morning. But while the dangerous center of the storm is no threat to land, heavy rains on the outer fringes of Earl have drenched that area of the Caribbean. Earl is forecast to bring an additional 1-4 inches of rain Monday, with isolated areas of 8 inches across parts of Puerto Rico, the US and British Virgin Islands and the Leeward Islands. Limited urban and flash flooding is possible, with rapid rises and mudslides possible in areas of steep terrain — particularly in central Puerto Rico. Conditions will improve later Monday as Earl drifts to the north and pulls away from the Caribbean. As of early Monday, the storm center was 190 miles north of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands and was heading north at 5 mph. An NOAA Hurricane Hunter found the center of Earl has strengthened a bit Monday morning and now has sustained winds of around 65 mph, with higher gusts. Earl is expected to strengthen during the week and become a hurricane on Wednesday afternoon, with long-range forecasts suggesting the storm could reach major hurricane strength by Saturday morning as it churns in the open Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center expects Earl to react to a weakness in a ridge and turn more northerly over the next few days, but a turn to the right will keep the cyclone well east of the southeastern US coast and safely out to sea. However, those in Bermuda should monitor Earl’s progress as the island does sit on the outer edge of the center’s forecast cone as the storm passes Friday morning. Hurricane Danielle became the first Atlantic hurricane of the season on Friday after August finished with no named storms for the first time in decades. But Danielle is harmlessly spinning over the Central Atlantic and is nearly 1,000 miles from the nearest land mass. After weakening to a tropical storm for most of Saturday, Danielle strengthened again into a Category 1 hurricane late Saturday and has held steady into Monday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85-90 and higher gusts. The storm continues to slowly move off to the northeast, in the general direction of Northern Europe. Danielle is expected to slowly weaken starting on Tuesday, then lose its tropical characteristics on Thursday morning. The tropics are heating up on the Pacific Ocean side of the continent, and now Tropical Storm Kay is keeping forecasters busy as it skirts the western Mexico coast this week. The storm is currently about 235 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico and about 580 miles south-southeast of the southern tip of Mexico’s Baja California. Peak sustained winds are estimated at 60 mph. While the storm is currently far from land, Kay is expected to strengthen into a hurricane Monday night or early Tuesday. What’s more, the forecasted track now has Kay curling to the north, approaching the southern tip of Baja California early Thursday as a hurricane. The current long-range forecast cone indicates that what could be Hurricane Kay by then has the potential for landfall along the Baja California coast on Thursday or Friday, and hurricane watches may be necessary along portions of the Baja California peninsula later Monday. What was briefly Tropical Storm Javier in the eastern Pacific Ocean is no more. In Sunday’s 5 a.m. advisory, the NHC downgraded Javier to a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 35 mph in what was its final advisory on Javier. Javier’s center was located about 210 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is expected to slowly turn westward into the open Pacific with further weakening through the week.

15,"Ex-Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez busted in bribery scheme with banker, former FBI agent",Mark Lungariello,2022-08-04,"Former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez was arrested Thursday in a bribery scheme in which she allegedly pushed out a high-ranking government official in exchange for more than $300,000 to help her 2020 campaign. Vázquez, 62, is accused of working out the bribes with conspirators who included a former FBI agent, a Venezuelan Italian bank owner and a political consultant, according to the Department of Justice. “Public corruption erodes the people’s trust in our institutions and fuels civil unrest,” Joseph González, special agent in charge of the FBI San Juan Field Office, said in a statement. “No one is above the law and the victim of this crime, the People, deserve better.” Vázquez, the second woman to serve as Puerto Rico’s governor, was elected in 2019 after mass protests forced her predecessor from office — and she once listed fighting corruption as a top priority for her administration in an interview with the Associated Press. But the DOJ said Vázquez agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for replacing the head of Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, which was scrutinizing an international bank operating in San Juan. She allegedly replaced the official with someone handpicked by the owner of the under-audit bank, Julio Martín Herrera Velutini. Herrera and his consultant — former FBI Special Agent Mark Rossini — allegedly promised through intermediaries to provide funding for Vázquez’s election bid in exchange for appointing the more favorable commissioner. Vázquez “demanded” the commissioner’s resignation in February 2020, and named a replacement in May 2020 who had previously worked as a consultant for Herrera’s bank, the DOJ said. More than $300,000 flowed from the banker and ex-federal agent to political consultants for Vázquez, federal prosecutors said. When Vázquez lost an election primary in August 2020, Herrera allegedly tried to bribe her successor with promises of campaign cash in exchange for ending the audit of the bank on favorable terms, the DOJ said. Intermediaries made the bribe offer to someone working with the FBI, according to the feds. A spokesman for Vázquez, a former justice secretary and district attorney, told the AP they had no immediate comment. The governor had previously denied wrongdoing to the news service when it became clear charges might be coming. “I can tell the people of Puerto Rico that I have not committed any crime, that I have not engaged in any illegal or incorrect conduct, as I have always said,” she said in May. Vázquez, the first former Puerto Rico governor to face federal charges, replaced former Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who stepped down amid controversies including accusations of corruption and economic struggles. She left office in 2021 after losing a New Progressive Party primary to now-Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. Pierluisi said in a statement that “no one is above the law in Puerto Rico.” “Faced with this news that certainly affects and lacerates the confidence of our people, I reiterate that in my administration, we will continue to have a common front with federal authorities against anyone who commits an improper act, no matter where it comes from or who it may implicate,” the governor said. Vázquez, Herrera and Rossini each face up to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, federal programs bribery and honest services fraud, the DOJ said. Also charged in the scheme are Frances Diaz, 50, the CEO and president of the bank, and John Blakeman, 53, Vázquez’s political consultant. Both have pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to arrange the bribes, the DOJ said Thursday. They each face five years behind bars.

11,AOC-backed Puerto Rico bill includes option for independence while retaining US citizenship,Houston Keene   ,2022-07-20,"A new bill that will decide Puerto Rico’s future with the United States is making its way through Congress and includes an option allowing people in the territory to retain their American citizenship while granting the area semi-independence status.The Puerto Rico Status Act, a compromise bill made up of legislation from Democratic Reps. Darren Soto of Florida and Nydia Velázquez of New York and blessed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, would determine Puerto Rico’s future.Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s Republican resident commissioner in the House also took part in negotiations. As did Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who threw herself into the mix of lawmakers crafting the bill, traveling with Velázquez to Puerto Rico amid the talks.Westerman’s committee foil, House Natural Resources Committee chair Raúl Grijalva, D-Ari., introduced the bill on Friday of last week and, so far, Hoyer has pushed the bill through the House under the cover of darkness.The bill has not received a markup until today and the lead Republican on the Natural Resources Committee, ranking member Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, was left out of negotiations.Westerman torched the Democrats over the bill, remarking that, as ""with most of the bills we've considered this Congress, my Democrat colleagues have seen an issue and taken the wrong approach in an attempt to address it.""""Today's vote on Puerto Rico’s political status is no exception,"" Westerman said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Chair Grijalva introduced the bill moments before noticing the markup, giving us no opportunity to consider it during a hearing and engage with experts to fully understand the legislation and its consequences.""""The bill has significant ramifications across a variety of congressional committees - on immigration, taxation, elections, and more - yet Democrats are rushing the bill through this committee only,"" the top House Natural Resources Republican continued. ""The legislation also fails to take into account the fact that Puerto Rico is still in the process of restructuring its multi-billion dollar debt, and bypassing all regular order to rush the island toward a different political status creates a dangerous procedural precedent.""""I have consistently said that I stand ready to work with the people of Puerto Rico to address questions regarding the island’s political status."" he added. ""Ms. Gonzalez-Colon has been a tireless advocate for her constituents on this issue, and it's unfortunate that committee Democrats have steamrolled the entire legislative process in their attempt to score political points.""The bill provides three options that Puerto Ricans would vote on regarding their territory’s future with America including statehood, independence, and ""sovereignty in free association with the United States.""Under the bill’s third option, Puerto Rico would have ""full authority and responsibility over its citizenship and immigration laws"" but would also simultaneously allow for Puerto Ricans born before independence day to retain their citizenship.Puerto Ricans who are not citizens but in the U.S. should the hammer drop on the option of free association would be eligible for naturalization as an American citizen.Additionally, children born in Puerto Rico to two U.S. citizens would be recognized as American citizens, as well. This would last for ""the duration of the first agreement"" of free association, but that could be indefinite.""For the duration of the first agreement of Articles of Free Association, an individual born in Puerto Rico to parents, both of whom acquired United States citizenship under section 302 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1402), shall acquire United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act in the same manner as children under section 301(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1401(c)),"" the bill reads. This means that, should Puerto Rico choose the third option, nearly every Puerto Rican in the newly-independent country would be an American citizen, as would their children, and they would not have to pay U.S. taxes below a six-figure amount because they reside in a foreign nation.Puerto Ricans who become citizens under this option would also retain their right to vote in U.S. elections so long as they have lived in America at some point.American citizenship also affords unrestricted travel to and from the U.S. The free association option also allows the U.S. or Puerto Rico to end the agreement between the countries ""at will by either party at any time.""Should Puerto Rico end its free association with the U.S. after choosing this option, the country full of Americans could turn around and strike a deal with adversaries — such as China or Russia.Additionally, if Puerto Rico chooses to become independent, U.S. citizens in the new country would retain their citizenship for life, and anyone born in the country after independence would be allowed to travel to and work in America for 25 years after the fact.Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow and manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that in ""prior plebiscites, Puerto Ricans have split on whether to remain a territory, try to become a state, or become an independent nation.""""Having yet another plebiscite is a waste of time and money that could be better spent on the territory trying to remedy its financial problems caused by waste, corruption, and overspending of the territorial government,"" Von Spakovsky said. ""None of that would be fixed by Puerto Rico becoming a state or an independent nation.""Von Spakovsky said the ""same political opposition that exists to the District of Columbia becoming a state would also prevent Congress from approving Puerto Rico as a state, particularly given that the addition of two more liberal senators to the U.S. Congress and more Democratic electoral votes would be filibustered and uniformly opposed by Republicans, particularly if it were combined with a similar bill for D.C.""""Democrats sponsoring this Puerto Rico bill could not politically oppose a parallel effort by the District, which would help ensure its defeat,"" he added.Heritage Foundation Border Security and Immigration Center senior research fellow Simon Hankinson warned that ""Democrat sponsors are being too generous in letting them potentially have their cake and eat it too.""""Puerto Ricans would get a 25-year transition period during which they could live and work in the US; It’s not clear how this is in anyway in the rest of America’s best interests,"" Hankinson said.  ""There is so much devil in the details of this bill.""""For example, imagine the evidentiary burden of proving that one of your parents had a residence in the US prior to your birth. Will this be a job for consular staff in our new Embassy San Juan? Or another thing for overworked USCIS to do?"" he continued.""This bill isn’t going anywhere, but it’s important to look at this in the larger context: what a thing to be worrying about when the border is wide open,"" Hankinson added.Puerto Ricans were granted citizenship rights via the Jones Act of 1917, which granted people born in the territory the rights and privileges of someone born stateside.Hoyer has long been a proponent of Puerto Rico statehood. Successful negotiations on the bill would become the hallmark of Hoyer’s time in Congress and, by the political makeup of the territory, would likely give the Democrats two more seats in the Senate.However, with the razor-thin majority in the House, progressives like Velázquez and Ocasio-Cortez have more influence in negotiations.Additionally, should the GOP retake the House, the aging Hoyer will likely not return to his post as the top House Democrat, meaning he is likely looking to cement his legacy.A spokesperson for Hoyer pointed Fox News Digital towards the House Natural Resources Committee when asked for comment.Soto, Velázquez, Ocasio-Cortez, and González-Colón did not respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.Houston Keene is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.  Story tips can be sent to Houston.Keene@Fox.com and on Twitter: @HoustonKeene ",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-backed-puerto-rico-bill-includes-option-independence-retaining-us-citizenship,Fox,Conservative

Eight Haitians were among those saved and hospitalized during a “mass rescue effort” led by the US Coast Guard. It was unclear how many people were on the capsized vessel, which was first spotted by a US Customs and Border Protection helicopter about 11 miles north of the uninhabited Puerto Rican island of Desecheo, according to authorities. “We’re looking to rescue as many people as we can and find as many survivors as we can,” US Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said, adding it was fortunate that officials spotted the overturned boat. “If not for that, we would not have known about this until someone would have found any sign or received reports from people that their loved ones are missing,” Castrodad said. “They found them early enough that we were able to coordinate a response.” The disaster came after a string of migrant boats transporting people fleeing Haiti and the Dominican Republic capsized in the waters around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. On Saturday, officials rescued 68 migrants in treacherous waters between Hispaniola and the US territory. One Haitian woman died, according to Castrodad. More than three dozen migrants were presumed dead off the coast of Florida in January when a smuggling boat from the Bahamas was flipped over in a storm. In excess of three thousand migrants from the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba were detained by the Coast Guard in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean in the 2021 fiscal year, according to the feds. “These voyages are dangerous,” Castrodad said. “They’re unsafe, they are grossly overloaded … (and) no lifesaving equipment.

Those who could not afford generators and have medical conditions such as diabetes, which depends on refrigerated insulin, worried about how much longer they’d be without power.Long lines formed at some gas stations as people sought fuel for generators. Others tried to charge their cellphones at businesses in scenes reminiscent of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which struck as a Category 4 storm in 2017.Officials in at least one city distributed food to hundreds of elderly people as well as ice to those whose medication must be kept cool.""This is horrible,"" said Luisa Rosado, a mother of two who lives in the San Juan neighborhood of Río Piedras.She said she and her husband had sacrificed their savings to install a solar electricity system at their home after Hurricane Maria, which left them with at least partial power following the blackout.She said her neighbors had been outraged by recent increases in power bills, which were already higher than in most U.S. states. ""To increase bills when you don’t provide a perfect service ... the level of impunity is absurd,"" Rosado said.Luma, the company that took over transmission and distribution from Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority last year, said the blackout could have been caused by a circuit-breaker failure at the Costa Sur generation plant — one of four main plants on the island.""The system is being restored little by little,"" said Kevin Acevedo, a vice president of Luma, adding that the company is trying to complete the work within 24 hours. ""The people of Puerto Rico have to understand that it’s a system with a lot of years. Bringing back Puerto Rico’s system is a delicate and complicated process.""Luma said the exact cause of the interruption is unknown.""It’s going to require an exhaustive investigation,"" Acevedo said, adding that that the equipment whose failure sparked the fire had been properly maintained.Officials said at least three generation units were back online by Thursday, with crews working to restore more.Luma CEO Wayne Stensby called it a ""very unusual"" outage that ""clearly indicates the fragility of the system.""The outage occurred two months before the Atlantic hurricane season starts, worrying many about the condition of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.""Yes, the system is fragile, no one is denying that, but we’re prepared,"" Acevedo said.Police officers were stationed at main intersections to help direct traffic on Thursday while health officials checked in at hospitals to ensure generators were still running.The outage further enraged Puerto Ricans already frustrated with an electricity system razed by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Emergency repairs were made at the time, but reconstruction efforts have not yet started, and power company officials blame aging, ill-maintained infrastructure for the ongoing outages.A series of strong earthquakes that struck southern Puerto Rico where the Costa Sur plant is located also had damaged it.The Electric Power Authority also is trying to restructure $9 billion worth of public debt to emerge from a lengthy bankruptcy.

18,Puerto Rico plunged into darkness after power station fire,Associated Press,2022-04-06,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A major power outage hit Puerto Rico late Wednesday, plunging nearly 350,000 customers into darkness after a fire erupted at one of the largest power plants in the U.S. territory. The outage was one of the biggest in recent months for the island’s crumbling electrical grid, which has seen its periodic blackouts grow worse the last few years. The outage elicited a collective groan from people across Puerto Rico as many who depend on insulin or respiratory therapies once again worried about how long it would last. “Apagón!” wrote many frustrated customers across social media, using the Spanish word for outage. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said priority would be given to hospitals and other institutions as he tweeted: “I urge everyone to remain calm.” Puerto Rico’s health secretary said generators at all hospitals and health centers were functioning and had enough fuel, adding that coronavirus vaccines remained properly stored at the correct temperature. Transportation officials said crews evacuated passengers from the island’s rapid transit system and took them to their destinations via buses. Education officials said they would soon announce whether classes at public schools would be cancelled Thursday, frustrating many parents who worried they might not find out if their cellphones died and they were unable to charge them. Luma, a private company that took over transmission and distribution of the Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority last year, said in a statement that power might not be restored until Thursday, “given the size and scope” of the outage. “The power grid has suffered a massive island-wide blackout, potentially caused by a circuit breaker failure at the Costa Sur generation plant. We are not clear on the exact cause at this time,” the company said. Costa Sur is one of the island’s four main power plants. Puerto Rico’s fire department worked late into the night to put out the blaze as frustration and anger over yet another blackout continued to grow. Carian Montull, 36, said she was at a clothing store in southern Puerto Rico when the lights went out. She said the store’s generators failed to turn on, so she and about a dozen other customers were forced to leave their purchases behind and go home. She said someone nearby cried out: “The lights seriously went out?! It can’t be.” Montull said she doesn’t have a generator at home and hoped the power would come back soon so the food in her refrigerator wouldn’t spoil. Luma said it would release additional information once it had more details. When it took over transmission and distribution in June, the governor at the time said the company had pledged to reduce power interruptions by 30% and the length of outages by 40%. That same month, a large fire at a substation in the capital of San Juan left hundreds of thousands without power. Another fire at a power plant in September 2016 sparked an island-wide blackout. A year later, Hurricane Maria hit, razing the island’s frail electrical grid and leaving some customers without power for nearly a year. Emergency repairs have since been made, but reconstruction efforts have yet to start. In addition, Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority is trying to emerge from bankruptcy and holds some $9 billion in public debt that it is trying to restructure. The utility has long struggled with mismanagement, corruption and aging infrastructure that has not been maintained.

Pedro Pierluisi will lift all capacity restrictions at public and private businesses and said proof of vaccination to enter will no longer be required. Vaccination requirements for public school students, restaurant employees and health workers will be lifted.In the contiguous U.S., officials announced Monday that Chicago Public Schools will stop requiring face masks for staff and students beginning on March 14.""CPS was one of the first to require universal masking in schools, and we would not be moving to a mask-optional model unless the data and our public health experts indicated that it is safe for our school communities,"" CEO Pedro Martinez said in a statement.The change applies inside school buildings, on school property and on school buses. However, students and employees will still be encouraged to wear masks, and especially those in schools with lower vaccination rates. Martinez pointed to other large school districts’ decisions to stop requiring face masks in recent weeks. On Monday, masks became optional in New York City schools and restaurants and cultural attractions could stop asking patrons for proof of vaccination.Philadelphia is set to lift its mandate on Wednesday, joining several other big cities. But in Chicago, Martinez's s announcement drew immediate pushback from the Chicago Teachers Union, which plans to file an unfair labor practice charge with the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board. ""Our city is fortunate that the numbers around the COVID-19 pandemic have shifted, with deaths, hospitalizations and positive cases low,"" the union said in a statement. ""But CPS buildings are congregate settings where vaccination rates also remain low, especially in schools with majority Black and Brown students on the South and West sides of the city."" Meanwhile, in New York City, a group of parents plans to sue Mayor Eric Adams over his continuing mask mandates for children 4 and under in schools.Leaders have cited falling infection rates and new federal health guidance, but those hesitant about ending school mask mandates often point to low childhood vaccination rates among American children. Only about a quarter of children ages 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC recently issued guidelines saying that most Americans live in areas where healthy people can remove their masks..Julia Musto is a reporter for Fox News and Fox Business Digital. ",https://www.foxnews.com/health/masks-drop-chicago-teachers-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative
19,How Puerto Rico became a tax haven for high-flying crypto millionaires,Mark Ellwood,2021-12-27,"Forget “What do you do?” or “Where do you live?” There’s only one question on anyone’s lips in Puerto Rico right now. “‘How long have you been here?’ — it’s the first thing anyone asks,” said Keiko Yoshino, 34, who previously worked in Washington, DC, city government before moving to the island in March. “For the longest time, I was the newbie, but my brother moved in with me four weeks ago.” For Joel Comm, the answer is seven months — when the 57-year-old and his girlfriend ditched Colorado for the gated community of Palmas del Mar on Puerto Rico’s southeastern coast. “It’s still a new experience for me, but when you get here, you’re ‘the new guy,’ ” Comm told The Post. “Two weeks later, someone else is here and all of a sudden, you’re not that guy anymore.” Many of them are here thanks to a near-irresistible combo — of legal and financial incentives, great weather and a critical mass of cryptocurrency gurus — that has been transforming the island like a gold rush. The surge is helping reshape Puerto Rico into America’s homegrown answer to Dubai. Call it Crypto Rico. Both Comm and Yoshino came here for crypto gigs. He is a self-employed entrepreneur and podcast host, while she helps run the Puerto Rico Blockchain Trade Association, which hosted a week-long shindig in early December, timed for jetsetters to bounce down to the island after Art Basel Miami. Among the boldfaced names on-island full-time are controversial YouTuber Logan Paul — who started his own NFT trading game, CryptoZoo and who is reportedly splashing out $55,000 per month on a home — and Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. She admitted she’d decamped to the Enchanted Isle from Silicon Valley earlier this year and has she’s been living off crypto investments. No one gets more attention, though, than Brock Pierce. The former child actor turned crypto evangelist, 41, is the de facto head of the crypto-championing movement here. He recently hosted Eric Adams on his jet when New York City’s mayor-elect jaunted down to check out the island for himself. “What made Dubai into Dubai, or Singapore into Singapore, was, ultimately, the social, financial and intellectual capital there. Look at those places 50 years ago — they were basically nothing,” Pierce told the Post, rapid-fire in his enthusiasm. “But encouraging foreign investment into those regions, they made themselves into the smartest cities in the world.” One way they could have scored such primo investments? Slashing taxes and red tape, a tactic that Puerto Rico has followed with gusto. Put simply, thanks to changes in the law, which are lumped together and known as Act 60, you can live there and keep two things: both your American passport and huge chunks of your earnings that Uncle Sam would otherwise grab. Spend 183 days on-island each year, and you’re free of taxes on capital gains. If you operate a firm that exports its services from Puerto Rico — say, as a crypto consultant — you’ll pay a paltry 4 percent corporate tax rate. No wonder crypto types, already wary of centralized oversight and focused on cashing in fast and rich, have flocked here. Pierce helped accelerate that move and now is like a one-man PR machine for Puerto Rico. The “Mighty Ducks” actor said he first fell in love with the island in 2014 and began plowing his crypto fortune — reportedly more than a billion dollars — into real estate and starting real-world businesses. He’s soon to open an art gallery — working name: Smart Gallery — in a building he owns in Old San Juan. Run by his wife, Crystal, it’ll sell both virtual and IRL artworks. “I don’t meet everyone who moves down here, but I meet a lot [of them]. My name is pretty well known within the community,” he said, though he isn’t BFFs with Facebook exile Haugen, “We’re one degree of separation, and we’re connected to a lot of the same people. Her name is constantly brought up.” The true turning point wasn’t Pierce’s arrival a pair of but near-simultaneous bad news/good news events: the devastation of Hurricane Maria and a bull run in Bitcoin, both of which happened toward the end of 2017. More than 140,000 locals left the island after the storm, which saw real estate prices plummet — creating an ideal opening for the virtually rich, flush with crypto, to swoop in and snap up a sunny home or two. Now the island is in phase two of the Crypto Rico movement, again powered by a virtual bull market, according to Giovanni Mendez. At 34, the San Juan-based attorney said he’s the oldest person at the crypto-focused law firm he runs. “If I had more space to hire people, I would,” he told The Post, noting that applications for Act 60-related benefits from new arrivals are double now what they were in 2017. Among them is Theodore Agranat, 45. He grew up in Austria before dropping out of high school at 15 and becoming an entrepreneur. Agranat now runs an early-stage Blockchain investment fund called Alpha Crypto. After a trial stint in Puerto Rico early this year, he and his wife moved there in June with their kids, ages 18, 14 and 5, after selling their house in Massachusetts. They brought just a couple of suitcases. “My five-year-old daughter can continue swimming, instead of crying when the local pools shut down. Almost every other day she tells me ‘This is the best day of my life,'” Agranat said. But he’s also aware of controversies swirling around wealthy, mostly white people like him who are accused of a 21st-century return to colonialism via the back — or virtual — door. “I identify more with the working class, hardworking person than with people who buy Lamborghinis and yachts,” Agranat said, noting that his own hardscrabble beginnings, as well as having a Korea-born and multiracial kids, likely offer him a broader perspective than some. The tension between high-living expats surfing the crypto wave and many locals is understandable: 43 percent of Puerto Rico’s population lives in poverty versus a 13.4 percent national poverty rate for the US. Much of the pushback has been channeled through an anonymous, grassroots organization called #AbolishAct60 which rages on social media against cashed-up incomers. Representatives for the group did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Brock Pierce certainly champions a do-gooding cred — “I do not intend to take … a penny from the island when I leave, and any profits I make here will be reinvested in the island or given to charity,” he said — and most of his acolytes tout similar high-minded goals. Attorney Mendez, for example, said that a net of 40,000 jobs has been created over the last decade as a result of the umbrella of incentives. But, at least at the outset, this new community was white and bro-heavy; they even mulled nicknaming their efforts Puertopia, or “eternal boy playground,” a tin-eared appropriation of the local dialect. Now, though, crypto passes the taxi driver test: Is it something a cabbie starts gabbing about on a quick ride? “Every Uber driver I ride with, 90 percent of them know about crypto,” said Yoshino, who leads seminars for the Puerto Rico Blockchain Trade Association. “And the guy who drove me to my first event pulled over the car and came to the class I was running.” Digital marketing vet Juan Carlos Pedreira is from Puerto Rico and said the big uptick in uptake isn’t just fortune-hunting snowbirds. He calls out twentysomething locals, like a waiter at his fave spot in San Juan. “Every time I go in there he asks me about some new coin platform or wallet he’s into,” said Pedreira. “I told him, ‘The people you’re serving here are probably millionaires, but you have such knowledge that down the road, you could be better off than the people you’re serving.'” Pedreira also stresses that the Crypto Rico scene isn’t just about digital currency like Bitcoin — catnip for high-risk investors — but also includes blockchain, which effectively offers unbreakable encryption that could be used for everything from product authenticity to voting without fear of fraud or other interference. That’s the aspect of crypto that most interests 53-year-old Raul Moris, a social worker from Yauco on the south coast, who notes that the endemic corruption problems here have primed people to embrace such ideas. He has self-funded a program to help spark local interest in the crypto boom, using his graphic design skills to mock up pamphlets and translating the Anglo-heavy lingo into criollo-friendly Spanish. “The idea is to educate people and give them access to what Mr. Brock has,” he said, framing Pierce and his cohort differently: Puerto Rico isn’t lucky to have them; they’re lucky to have discovered the Enchanted Isle. “We don’t seem them as colonists. They’re more like migrant refugees who are just looking for a place not to give the government the money they can use for other purposes.” ",https://nypost.com/2021/12/27/how-puerto-rico-became-a-tax-haven-for-crypto-millionaires/,New York Post,Conservative
20,Heart-stopping moment massive shark chases surfers in Puerto Rico,"Katie Davis, The Sun",2021-12-01,"This is the dramatic moment two surfers were chased by a huge shark as they frantically tried to race back to shore. Heart-stopping footage shows the beast’s dorsal fin poking out of the water in Puerto Rico as choppy waves crash around it – just feet away from the pair. Two people in the water can be seen desperately trying to swim away as the shark thrashes in the water close by at Middles Beach, Isabela. Surfer Rolando Montes can be seen making a panicked bid to paddle back to the safety of the beach while his pal also tries to get away on top of his board. Stunned onlooker Jorge Benitez filmed the too close for comfort encounter as his friends fled from the massive predator. He says sharks are rarely spotted in the area. “This is the first shark I see,” Benitez said. “Although it’s known they are around the areas, but apparently they have enough food so we barely have incidents if any.” Shark attacks in waters off Puerto Rico are rare – with the most recent incident reported back in 2011. It comes after the number of shark attacks explodes across the globe as swimmers continue to ignore bloodbath warning signs – seeing nearly 800 people mauled in just nine years. America has overtaken Australia for the number of attacks with Cape Cod, Massachusetts, now considered the shark capital of the world. Experts report seeing 50 in the popular holiday haven alone this summer. However, despite a spike in maulings by the ferocious beasts and signs warning of attacks on beaches in the US and Australia, swimmers are still putting themselves at risk. This year has seen 49 shark attacks – six being fatal – across the globe, as the underwater predators continue to get closer to humans. The US recorded the largest number of shark bites, reporting 33 incidents, while Australia recorded 18. A whopping 791 shark attacks have been reported between 2010 and 2019, according to data published by the International Shark Attack File, with an annual global average of 80 bites. It shows an incredible rise compared to data from 1970 to 1979, when just 157 attacks were reported. Surfers and water sports lovers seem to be the prime targets, accounting for 61 percent of victims last year. Meanwhile, a researcher was astonished when he spotted a shark that was still hunting for its prey – despite being “half eaten”. The scientist, who was releasing an oceanic black tip shark into the sea, was stunned as he saw the injured beast mauled in a cannibalistic attack. Dr Mario Lebrato, 35, from Spain, said he captured the incredibly rare footage off the shore of Mozambique – some one to two meters below the surface of the Indian Ocean. But as he and his group released the shark, a different group of predators set upon it, inflicting a series of fatal injuries. Despite the onslaught and a large portion of its lower body missing, the shark continued to fight for its life as it was seen swimming away.

21,Eric Adams flew to Puerto Rico on bitcoin billionaire’s private jet,Theo Wayt,2021-11-23,"Mayor-elect Eric Adams flew to Puerto Rico earlier this month on a bitcoin billionaire’s private jet — even as he claimed that the trip was on “my dollar, my dime and my time.” New York City’s next mayor — who has pledged in recent weeks to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin and said cryptocurrencies should be taught in schools — hitched a ride to San Juan on billionaire Brock Pierce’s private Gulfstream jet, Adams spokesman Evan Thies told The Post. Thies said Adams paid for the ride on his donor’s plane through a travel agent. He did not provide a receipt or say how much Adams paid for the flight, saying only that it was “the cost of a leg of an open private flight.” While in Puerto Rico, Adams stayed mum about the flight with Pierce, who has donated to his campaign and partied with him on election night. Instead, the mayor-elect told reporters in San Juan that he had paid for the trip himself. “Before the question is asked, I paid my own way. I learned the best way to tell people to mind their business is to come out your pocket and cut your own check, so I’m here on my time,” Adams said at the time, according to Politico. “It’s on my dollar, my dime and my time.” The jet ride was first reported by Politico, which also said that Adam’s girlfriend Tracey Collins rode on Pierce’s plane — an accusation Thies denied. The trio had dinner with Puerto Rico’s governor, Pedro Pierluisi, according to the outlet. Pierce — an eccentric ex-child actor who appeared in Disney’s “The Mighty Ducks” and received 50,000 votes in a 2020 presidential run — was mum about the issue when reached by The Post. “I’m not commenting on any of Eric’s business,” Pierce said. “I don’t have any role in his administration.” Pierce is part of a community of crypto traders who have moved to Puerto Rico, which has looser tax rules than the mainland US. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and YouTube star Logan Paul also relocated to the island in 2021 — even as critics have griped that crypto-consumed outsiders are driving up housing prices for locals. The SOMOS conference, which took place in San Juan in early November, is an annual gathering where New York politicians, lobbyists, operatives and union leaders hobnob and form alliances. In addition to Adams, this year’s event was attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio, Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Attorney General Letitia James. De Blasio downplayed the issue during a Tuesday press conference. “I think Eric Adams has a real moral center, I really do,” the Mayor said in response to a question about Adams’ jet ride. “I’m sure he will figure out the right way to handle these things. So I wouldn’t read too much into one moment. I think he is someone who — he’s been a public servant his whole life, and for the right reasons.” –Additional reporting by Sam Raskin ",https://nypost.com/2021/11/23/eric-adams-flew-to-puerto-rico-on-bitcoin-billionaire-jet-report/,New York Post,Conservative
23,Schumer shimmies at SOMOS after Dem infrux win — breaking mask rules,Mary Kay Linge,2021-11-06,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hit the dance floor in Puerto Rico Friday night to celebrate the Democrats’ long-awaited infrastructure vote — but ditched his face mask, despite strict local rules requiring them. Schumer was spotted attempting to merengue with City Council member Carlina Rivera (D-East Village) — also maskless — and cutting a rug with another unidentified woman at the annual SOMOS conference in the Caribbean territory, where a no-exceptions public mask mandate remains in place. The powerful Dem, dressed in chinos and a button-down white shirt, kept his reading glasses perched on his nose as he busted a move with his exuberant partners at a party that appeared to take place in a hotel conference room. “Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and pals in clear violation of Puerto Rico’s indoor mask mandate,” tweeted Carlos Berríos Polanco, a Puerto Rican journalist. “His dancing sucks too.” The conference is packed with New York pols, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, lame-duck Mayor Bill de Blasio, mayor-elect Eric Adams, and more — all of whom appear to be blissfully unaware of the local pandemic regulations. Schumer is the latest in a long line of politicians — including President Joe Biden and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot — who have been caught violating the strict pandemic mandates that they have championed. “But my kids didn’t get to have a homecoming dance this year,” mom Shannon Gamber complained on Twitter. The senator is fully vaccinated, has received a booster shot, and is regularly tested for COVID, his office said.

22,Taxpayers foot the bill for de Blasio’s trip to SOMOS in Puerto Rico: report,Rich Calder,2021-11-06,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has a parting gift for taxpayers: picking up the tab for him, his wife and an entourage of City Hall staffers to hit the annual SOMOS political retreat in Puerto Rico. The term-limited de Blasio — who is leaving office at year’s end after spending much of his eight years as mayor out of town pushing his progressive agenda — attended the five-day beachside conference running alongside first lady Chirlane McCray and six employees, The City first reported. De Blasio and McCray’s son Dante also attended, but paid his own way. De Blasio’s office declined to say how much taxpayers will get billed, but the mayor defended the trip. “For us, we are non-stop doing work on issues — literally all the time. I had meetings since the moment I got here with people about issues and problems in their community, elected officials, labor leaders, civic leaders,” de Blasio told reporters in Puerto Rico. De Blasio’s public schedule for Thursday and Friday showed him hitting numerous receptions affiliated with the conference, including ones hosted by Brooklyn and Queens Democratic leaders and New York State Association for Affordable Housing. The Department of Investigation last month released a scathing report outlining how de Blasio had taxpayers foot a nearly $320,000 tab for his security detail while touring the country in 2019 during his failed presidential bid. The agency called on de Blasio to reimburse the city, but he’s yet to comply. The City also reported that Gov. Kathy Hochul and some of her aides traveled to the San Juan conference on taxpayers’ dime. The governor’s husband, Bill Hochul, a top official at casino and concessions company Delaware North, paid for his own trip. Brooklyn Borough President and Mayor-elect Eric Adams was also at the conference with a half dozen aides and campaign staffers, but they reportedly paid their own way.

18,Schumer spotted maskless dancing in Puerto Rico as House voted on infrastructure package,Audrey Conklin   ,2021-11-06,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was spotted dancing without a mask on Friday in what appeared to be an indoor area in Puerto Rico, despite a government mask mandate.Schumer traveled to the island, along with other high-profile New York politicians, for the annual SOMOS Puerto Rico Conference to help advance Latino representation in the state's government.""Schumer is feeling the music at Somos,"" New York Times reporter Emma Fitzsimmons said in a Friday night tweet with a video of the senator dancing.The tweet came after House lawmakers passed Democrats' $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill across party lines, with 13 Republicans voting in favor of the legislation and six Democrats voting against it.Puerto Rico currently requires masks in indoor settings, regardless of an individual's vaccination status; it also requires masking at both indoor and outdoor events with more than 50 people.Additionally, the Somos website notes that in Puerto Rico, ""masks are required in all indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status,"" including for children ages two through 11.Schumer's office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News.Nearly 70% of Puerto Rico's adult population is fully vaccinated, and the island has a moderate COVID-19 transmission rate compared to the United States' mostly high transmission rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).A number of federal and state government leaders have been caught on camera defying state mask mandates that they have endorsed. Mask, vaccine and other COVID-19-related requirements have been largely politicized since the early days of the pandemic as government leaders continue to take vastly different stances on certain measures being imposed on the public. Masks are still required in public places, including schools and grocery stores, in counties across the U.S. in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Some places like New York City require people to present proof of vaccination in order to enter indoor restaurants and other businesses without a mask.Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

24,NY pols flock to influential SOMOS event in Puerto Rico,"Julia Marsh,, Bernadette Hogan, Sam Raskin",2021-11-03,"New York’s political heavyweights began flying to Puerto Rico on Wednesday, fresh off Election Day, for the influential annual SOMOS conference promoting Latino representation in government. The five-day event in San Juan — coming as next year’s crowded New York governor’s race and City Council speaker contest take shape — is considered key to starting new alliances and cementing old ones. Organized by the prominent nonprofit, the event features political maneuvering and hobnobbing at workshops, receptions, conferences and parties. The gatherings are typically attended by a who’s who of elected officials, lobbyists, operatives, organized labor leaders and other insiders, and this year will be no different. “A lot of deals get cut at SOMOS,” a labor and political campaign operative told The Post. “It’s a lot of people hanging out at hotels and gossiping, getting information from different people.” On Wednesday morning, state Attorney General Letitia James, who just announced she is running against Gov. Kathy Hochul in the Democratic primary in June, was spotted at Kennedy Airport for an 11:30 a.m. flight to the yearly political affair. Hochul — who soon after taking office declared she will run for a full term — is set to arrive in Puerto Rico on Thursday and stay until Saturday, according to sources with knowledge of her plans. She will host a reception Friday evening on the Caribbean island. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been taking steps toward a run for governor, revealed during a virtual press briefing that he will be headed to Puerto Rico on Thursday, too. The lame-duck mayor plans to stay through the weekend, a City Hall rep told The Post. His successor, Eric Adams, is planning to arrive in Puerto Rico on Friday and then go on to the Dominican Republic, a source familiar with his travel plans told The Post. Top Adams campaign staffer Jose Bayona and Brooklyn Borough Hall senior adviser Stefan Ringel were to arrive in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, two days ahead of their boss, Brooklyn’s current borough president. City Council Speaker Corey Johnson — who will be out of elected office next year thanks to term limits and his city comptroller primary loss over the summer to fellow Councilman Brad Lander — told a reporter while boarding a plane to the island that this year’s conference will be his last. US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was expected to be at the event Friday and Saturday. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli took a JetBlue flight out of Queens on Wednesday morning and is scheduled to host a “meet and greet” in the evening. State Sen. Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is set to fly down Thursday and leave Friday. Progressive State Sen. Jessica Ramos of Queens and ex- Bronx Assemblyman Marcos Crespo hopped on an early Wednesday plane out of JFK.  State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie was also on a flight to the conference Wednesday. State Assemblywoman Maritza Davila of Bushwick, Brooklyn, arrived a couple days before others, since she serves as chairwoman of the Assembly’s Puerto Rican Hispanic Task Force. AG James’ chief of staff, Ibrahim Khan, who will be assembling a team as his boss tries to oust Hochul next year, took an early Wednesday flight to Puerto Rico. Also attending the conference are: State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Mike Gianaris, City Council budget committee chair Daniel Dromm, who represents parts of Queens; Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz (D- Forest Hills) Councilwoman Diana Ayala (D-East Harlem), a contender to be the next speaker; outgoing Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.;  Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz (D – Jackson Heights) building service worker union 32BJ head Kyle Bragg, Johnson’s chief of staff and lobbyist Jason Goldman; Assemblywoman Carmen De la Rosa (D-Upper Manhattan; state Sen.

25,Why Facebook whistleblower and her ‘crypto friends’ moved to Puerto Rico,Theo Wayt,2021-10-25,"When Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen isn’t flying around the world urging lawmakers to regulate her ex-employer, she’s apparently living off little-taxed cryptocurrency profits in her new home of Puerto Rico. “For the foreseeable future, I’m fine, because I did buy crypto at the right time,” Haugen said in an interview with the New York Times published Sunday when asked how she’s supported herself since leaving Facebook. Her move to Puerto Rico in March was motivated by a desire to join her “crypto friends” on the island, as well as a health condition, Haugen added. Puerto Rico — a US territory known for its beaches, rainforests and Spanish Colonial architecture — has become a hub for cryptocurrency investors like Haugen in recent years thanks largely to its status as a tax haven. Under a law called Act 22, people who live in Puerto Rico for at least half of the year are exempt from taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains — meaning they can cash in on earnings from crypto and other investments without forking over money to Uncle Sam. In a bid to take advantage of the loose tax laws, top crypto firms including the hedge fund Pantera Capital and NFT marketplace SuperRare have ditched New York and Silicon Valley for Puerto Rico in recent years. Other crypto investors, flush with cash amid the crypto boom, have used their little-taxed profits to buy up property in San Juan with a vision to build a new society called “Puertopia.” YouTube star and crypto investor Logan Paul also moved to the US territory earlier this year and has been renting a mansion for about $55,000 per month — a move that Paul admitted was primarily motivated by the country’s tax policies. “In Puerto Rico you’re motivated to do more and make more money because of the implications that come with it,” said Paul, according to Time. The territory’s lax tax laws have also drawn interest from more traditional financiers — including legendary hedge fund manager John Paulson, who mulled moving to the island for tax reasons in 2013, Bloomberg reported. While supporters of Puerto Rico’s tax breaks argue that they bring much-needed investment to an island that lags behind the mainland US in economic development, critics have slammed outsiders for driving up housing prices in what they call a modern day form of colonialism. For Haugen’s part, she gave little detail on her crypto investments and friends in the New York Times interview — and it’s unclear if she will qualify this year for Puerto Rico’s tax exemptions under Act 22, which was passed in 2012 as “The Individual Investors Act.” The law stipulates that investors like Haugen must live in Puerto Rico for 183 days out of the year in order to qualify for the exemption. They’re also encouraged to show other evidence of local residency by obtaining local bank accounts, drivers licenses and voter registrations. Since Haugen moved to Puerto Rico in March and has since flown to Washington, D.C. and London to meet with lawmakers and testify about Facebook, she may not rack up enough days on the island to quality for the exemption. Bill Burton, a former Obama administration press secretary who is helping Haugen with media relations, did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.

26,Jasmine Camacho-Quinn wins first gold for Puerto Rico in track and field,Gabrielle Fonrouge,2021-08-02,"Jasmine Camacho-Quinn won first place in the women’s 100m hurdle on Monday — Puerto Rico’s first-ever gold medal in track and field. The 24-year-old athlete redeemed herself five years after she was disqualified from the Olympics when she crashed into a hurdle. She beat Team USA’s Keni Harrison by .15 seconds in a historic upset that shattered Harrison’s previous world record in the event and made her the second Puerto Rican athlete in history to win a gold medal. “It really means a lot,” Camacho-Quinn said following the win. “This year I trained really hard. I don’t have a training partner, I train by myself, so I gave it all I had and this is what I wanted for this year. I wanted to be a gold medalist and I got it.” Puerto Rico, a US territory, competes under their own flag in the Olympics and while Camacho-Quinn was born in South Carolina and raised in the US, her mother is from the island and the runner wanted to represent her heritage. “I am pretty sure everybody [in Puerto Rico] is excited,” the athlete said, according to People. “For such a small [territory] it gives little people hope. I am just glad I am the person to do that.” In 2016, Camacho-Quinn failed to advance to the finals in Rio de Janeiro after she crashed into a hurdle and was disqualified from the event. “I felt embarrassed, like I let the whole country down,” she said previously. On Monday, she admitted the disqualification still stings and was concerned history would repeat itself in Tokyo. “It stays with me all the time because I am constantly reminded. Somebody always messages me and says sorry for what happened. Yesterday I kind of had a breakdown because I didn’t want the same thing to happen again,” Camacho-Quinn said. Despite the pressure that comes with competing in the Olympics, the runner tried to remember what she learned in her practice sessions and keep a clear head. “I just had to treat every race like there is no difference to any other competition.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has suffered in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria in 2017, then Puerto Rican politicians are to blame, not former President Trump.That’s the assessment of an aunt of the New York Democrat, who was interviewed in Puerto Rico by Britain’s Daily Mail.Ocasio-Cortez made headlines earlier this month after posting photos from the Puerto Rico home of her 81-year-old grandmother, or ""abuela,"" Clotilde Rivera, and claiming that the residence remained in disrepair, nearly four years after the hurricane, in part because ""Trump blocked relief $ for PR.""But when a Daily Mail reporter visited Rivera’s home this week, a woman there who claimed to be AOC’s aunt said the congresswoman’s story wasn’t accurate. The aunt noted that the Category 5 hurricane caused extensive damage to the island  but insisted Trump wasn’t to blame for residents struggling to receive aid.""It’s a problem here in Puerto Rico with the administration and the distribution of help,"" the aunt told the Daily Mail. ""It is not a problem with Washington. We had the assistance and it didn’t get to the people.""""It’s a problem here in Puerto Rico with the administration and the distribution of help.

But she added that much of the problem was ""systemic,"" and also blamed ""La Junta,"" the island’s fiscal control board, as well as local leaders.The end result, she claimed, has been ""policies that pushed out local families.""Ocasio-Cortez then called for audits of how relief funding was being distributed  and assured her Twitter followers that Rivera was ""doing okay"" despite what the photos of her home seemed to suggest.""She had a place to go to and be cared for,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote, then asked, ""what about the thousands of people who don’t?""Hurricane Maria damaged 90 percent of Puerto Rico’s 1.3 million residences and left nearly 3,000 people dead, the Daily Mail reported.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aocs-aunt-says-blame-puerto-rico-pols-not-trump-for-abuela-misery-report,Fox,Conservative
27,Inside Logan Paul’s swanky $13M Puerto Rico mansion,Mary K. Jacob,2021-06-03,"Logan Paul is currently living in a $13 million Puerto Rico mansion, The Post can reveal. The YouTube star got into the ring with retired national champion boxer Floyd Mayweather, in what some called a $100 million publicity fight. But 26-year-old Paul has been vocal and determined to prove himself as more than just a social-media mogul — so much so that he left his Los Angeles lifestyle and moved out to the island in March to focus on training. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom abode where Paul trained is located in the Dorado Beach East Community at the Ritz Carlton Reserve. Owned by content creator Kevin Thobias, Paul is paying an estimated $55,000 per month for the fully furnished home, according to the listing. Features of the modern-style property, which spans more than 5,200 square feet, include a fully equipped kitchen, an open-space living area, high ceilings, an expansive pool and a gazebo. Pegged as an executive resort house, the gated community provides full access to over 2,000 acres of landscaped golf courses, tropical gardens and beaches. It’s also possible that Paul could eventually come to buy the home himself as it is currently on the market. The star shocked fans back in February when he announced he was leaving California after being “bitten” by the bug that so many Los Angeles residents were feeling, and admitted he wanted “a change” in his life. “I went out there to scout it, and I fell in love with it,” Paul said about Puerto Rico in an episode of his “imPaulsive” podcast. “Obviously, I’m impulsive, and I trust my gut, my instincts. I feel like it’s the closing of a chapter and the opening of a new one.” Recently, Paul’s brother Jake left his West Coast lifestyle as well and moved to Florida to also focus on a boxing career.

28,AOC slammed for not helping grandma in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico home,Samuel Chamberlain,2021-06-02,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was hammered on Twitter Wednesday after she posted a lengthy thread highlighting the plight of her grandmother in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico. “Just over a week ago, my abuela fell ill,” Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) began. “I went to Puerto Rico to see her- my 1st time in a year+ bc of COVID. “This is her home,” the congresswoman added, posting a picture of a dwelling with a damaged roof, little dresser, and no bedding. “Hurricane María relief hasn’t arrived. Trump blocked relief $ for PR. People are being forced to flee ancestral homes, & developers are taking them.” Over the next few tweets, the self-described Democratic socialist took aim at the former president and local politicians over the distribution of aid following the devastating impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017. “And for the record – my abuela is doing okay. It’s not about us, but about what’s happening to Puerto Rican’s across the island,” she concluded. “She had a place to go to and be cared for – what about the thousands of people who don’t?” Social media users were apoplectic that the lawmaker didn’t do more for her aged relative. “Shameful that you live in luxury while allowing your own grandmother to suffer in these squalid conditions,” tweeted Daily Wire host Matt Walsh. “Honey, you drive a Tesla and have two apartments,” Florida GOP congressional candidate Lavern Spicer chimed in. “If your grandmother is living poor that’s because you don’t help her out. I’m surprised that a socialist wouldn’t redistribute that wealth to their grandma. Sad!” “Sell your Tesla!” added Twitter user @beyondreasdoubt. “You should be ashamed for letting her live like this. We have a responsibility to care for our elders!” The Washington Free Beacon reported this month that Ocasio-Cortez owns a Tesla Model 3 Long Range, which retails for between $46,000 and $59,000. Multiple outlets have previously reported that the New York congresswoman rests her head in a tony DC apartment building where rents range from $2,000 for a studio apartment to over $5,000 for a three-bedroom. Other Twitter users took issue with the political aspect of AOC’s story. “So you agree, the government is incompetent with getting relief $ to the people and would be better done through voluntarily contributions?” asked the Libertarian Party of Tennessee’s official account. “I just spent a week in Puerto Rico: everywhere from San Juan to eastern coast and western coast,” another user chimed in. “I never spoke to a single resident that thought anything was Trumps fault but instead LITERALLY EVERYONE said the Puerto Rican government sucks.” “Cousins in San Juan say that the local government is taking the money and not doing anything,” another user agreed. “He described it as what Wyclef did with the Haiti relief money. Are you willing to investigate that?” Ocasio-Cortez fired back at Walsh, saying: “You don’t even have a concept for the role that 1st-gen, first-born daughters play in their families. My abuela is okay. But instead of only caring for mine & letting others suffer, I’m calling attention to the systemic injustices you seem totally fine w/ in having a US colony.” “You used your grandmother’s suffering to score political points. You’re the one who publicized this,” Walsh retorted. “So I am entitled now to ask why you haven’t bothered to fix your grandmother’s collapsing roof or buy her some new furniture? Why are you waiting for the government to do it?” Puerto Rico’s recovery from Maria, which killed approximately 2,975, has been hampered by a series of earthquakes in 2019, followed by the coronavirus pandemic. In April, a government watchdog found that the Trump administration was responsible for stalling about $20 billion in federal funds to help Puerto Rico recover from Maria and also obstructed a probe into the delay. During his term, President Donald Trump bickered with Puerto Rican officials, blasting them as corrupt and inept, and opposed spending federal dollars to rebuild infrastructure that was wiped out by the storm. In September 2020, however, Trump approved spending $13 billion to rebuild an electrical grid that was wiped out by the storm. In his last weeks in office, Trump announced a $3.7 billion grant to help rebuild damaged water and wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations and reservoirs.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a photo of her grandmother’s Puerto Rico home in a state of disrepair in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria to demonstrate how the U.S. had blocked relief to the territory, but some questioned why she hadn’t offered to help repair the home herself. ""Just over a week ago, my abuela fell ill.

The federal government has allocated about $63 billion in relief funding. The Trump administration imposed strict guidelines to ‘enforce compliance’ with federal grant standards, blaming the island’s ""long history of financial mismanagement and corruption,"" a move which Democrats have said held up life-saving funding. Other replies to Ocasio-Cortez's tweet noted that the congresswoman makes $174,000 per year. ",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-photo-grandmothers-home-puerto-rico-trump-blocked-relief,Fox,Conservative
29,Puerto Rico investigating Jake Paul after viral video sparks turtle outrage,Ryan Dunleavy,2021-05-15,"Puerto Rico is acting fast to protect its turtles from Jake Paul and friends. The 24-year-old YouTube star and boxer published to Instagram a since-deleted video riding in one of two motorized vehicles rolling along a sandy beach, and he identified the location as Puerto Rico. The video caught the attention of Puerto Rican officials and could be a problem given the time of year: It’s turtle-nesting season. “I have ordered an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of two motor vehicles on beaches that are presented to be in Puerto Rico,” secretary of natural and environmental resources Rafael Marchargo said in a statement reported by TMZ. “Some media have published today a video of the influencer Jake Paul in a motor vehicle on the beach, an activity that is prohibited, apart from law enforcement agencies. “Although the video does not establish where or when it was carried out, the DNER reminds citizens that this type of activity is prohibited by law to protect the environment and the species that can nest or live on the beaches. Those who violate the law face fines and other penalties, if applicable.” Marchago’s statement applauded citizen watchdogs who called attention to “possible environmental damage that some people cause due to ignorance or unscrupulousness.” Paul’s camp said he didn’t mean any harm and was unaware of the beach rules, TMZ reported. It is unclear if 26-year-old Logan Paul was part of the group just three weeks before his scheduled bout against Floyd Mayweather. The Paul brothers gained fame as YouTube stars before becoming boxers and entrepreneurs. They reportedly bought a $10 million beachfront mansion in Puerto Rico earlier this year after Logan moved his “Maverick Clothing” business operations to the island. Logan Paul’s fight against Mayweather is set for June 6 at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium. In Jake Paul’s most recent fight last month, he knocked out former UFC participant Ben Askren in fewer than two minutes.

But Loat’s badly burned body was found by authorities on Sunday in the town of Vega Baja. No arrests have been made and police have not identified the suspects.

The clip shows tourists throwing drinks at a woman in a wheelchair after she asked them to wear masks, per USA Today.In March, two hotel guests in San Juan got in a fight that had to be broken up by security guards, too.In response to those incidents, police in San Juan started adding more officers to tourist hotspots in mid-March. ""We've assigned a lot of police, especially in the area of Condado due to the high number of incidents,"" San Juan's police chief Orlando Rivera Lebrón told USA Today. ""Ever since we started this plan, we have made several arrests and have intervened with a lot of disorderly conduct."" Rivera Lebrón told the outlet that since they’ve increased police presence in popular tourist spots, officers have arrested 27 people for violent behavior and drug possession. On Monday, Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said security around the territory would be increased even more for spring break, with more than 3,500 officers stationed at popular tourist spots and 1,100 active National Guard soldiers present to enforce Puerto Rico’s safety measures. Beyond the mask requirement, Puerto Rico’s COVID-19 safety protocol requires businesses to close at 11 p.m. The territory also mandated a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. as well. Ann W.

31,"Congress taking action on Puerto Rico statehood next month, governor says",Emily Jacobs,2021-02-15,"Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi expects the US House of Representatives to introduce legislation on statehood by mid-March, saying he has spoken to members of Congress about their plans. Pierluisi, who leads the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, revealed his expectations while speaking to “Axios on HBO” in an interview set to air Monday. “What I anticipate is that there will be considerable support for a statehood bill in this Congress,” Pierluisi told the outlet. “I believe you’ll see bills being introduced in the House at the latest by mid-March of this year, so within a month,” he added, citing conversations with Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Delegate Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PR). Until 2017, Pierluisi represented the island in the House, where he caucused with the Democrats, which explains his already close working relationships with many in the body. He was sworn in as governor last month. “I have gotten calls from members of the Senate inquiring about this issue and exploring it,” Pierluisi said, mentioning Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) as his most recent conversation. The two, the governor said, spoke last week about the matter. A spokesperson for Heinrich did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. “We need a game-changer in Puerto Rico. And one game-changer would be that we get equal treatment in key federal programs,” Pierluisi said, mentioning programs like Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Asked about the lack of outright support for statehood from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Nydia Velázquez (D-NY), who instead advocate for Puerto Rican independence or self-determination, Pierluisi said he looked forward to lobbying them on the issue. “I would love to have her support,” he said after being asked about AOC specifically. “And I don’t rule out convincing her to join me in the way that I’m approaching this.” Reps for AOC and Velázquez could not immediately be reached by The Post for clarification on their stances on the island’s status. Currently, Puerto Rican citizens cannot vote in the general election for the US presidency, and the island lacks full voting members of Congress without statehood. “Statehood is not a panacea. Of course, we have to do better. But there’s no question that having two senators and four representatives in Congress batting for us when needed would make a difference,” the island’s governor told the outlet. Puerto Rico voted in favor of statehood in November, with the motion carrying 52 percent support on the island. Forty-seven percent of the island’s citizens, however, voted against it. President Biden has expressed support for the idea of statehood, but it is not clear where he will stand once bills are introduced. A White House spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment. ",https://nypost.com/2021/02/15/congress-talking-puerto-rico-statehood-next-month-pedro-pierluisi/,New York Post,Conservative
32,Puerto Rico declares state of emergency over violence against women,"Greg Norman, Fox News",2021-01-28,"Puerto Rico has declared a state of emergency this week over violence against women — a move activists are hoping will help stem the tide of gender-based killings on the island, which average to at least one a week, reports say. The declaration from Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi calls for the creation of a mobile app to help victims report attacks and request help, in addition to starting a new program to monitor women who have taken out restraining orders against their abusers, according to the AFP. It also offers protection to gay and transgender residents. “Victims have suffered the consequences of systematic machismo, inequity, discrimination, lack of education, lack of guidance and above all lack of action,” Pierluisi said in a statement, adding that gender-based violence there has been “an evil that has caused too much damage for too long.” In 2020, Puerto Rico recorded 60 femicides, the Miami Herald reported, citing the Observatory for Gender Equity, a local watchdog group. The previous year, two other island-based rights groups released a study finding that at least one woman is killed in Puerto Rico every seven days, the newspaper added. Puerto Rico’s state of emergency defines gender-based violence as actions resulting in physical sexual or psychological harm to others that are motivated by stereotypes, the AFP reports. “Today is a great day for women, girls and all the people who have believed in the declaration of a state of emergency for gender violence, which we had been requesting for three years,” Lisdel Flores, the director of a shelter for victims of such attacks, told the AFP. Vilmarie Rivera, who leads the Puerto Rico Domestic Violence Shelter Network, added that “the government has recognized that there is a problem that we have to address as a priority.” The news agency says the declaration also comes days after a nurse was killed by her husband in an attack he reportedly has confessed to.

33,Inside Roberto Alomar’s plan to develop baseball talent in Puerto Rico,Ken Davidoff,2021-01-14,"Roberto Alomar owns two World Series rings and participated in seven postseasons, so the Hall of Famer certainly understands the value and joy of winning. Yet his most recent baseball experience concluded with a .111 winning percentage, and the childhood favorite of new Met Francisco Lindor sounded as proud of that as any of his other accomplishments. “Every day that we played, we improved, and by the end, all the kids played great,” Alomar, 52, told The Post of his RA12 club from the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente, Puerto Rico’s winter league, which posted a 2-16 mark in a COVID-shortened schedule. “That was my motive. I wasn’t looking to win. I was looking for them (with the idea of) if their career stops here, at least they can say I played pro baseball in Puerto Rico.” Alomar, who long has been active in youth endeavors for his native land, added to his credentials by becoming a team owner in the winter league. He employed his father Sandy Alomar, who played for the Yankees and coached for the Mets among many other stops at both gigs, as the general manager; his brother Sandy Alomar Jr., the former All-Star catcher who managed the Indians in Terry Francona’s absence last season, as a technical advisor; former White Sox outfielder-infielder Andy Gonzalez as manager; and former Met Carlos Baerga as bench coach, among many other hires. “When I was 17 years old, I came to this league in winter ball and they gave me a chance to play. I used it as a platform to learn the game when I played and I did really good,” Alomar said. “I used that platform as an experience because that platform was competitive baseball. It helped me develop myself as a player. “(Later), when I used to come here to the ballpark, I saw veteran guys play. I didn’t see them giving chances to the young guys. They always put them in reserve. I talked to my dad and said, ‘We don’t develop young guys. They come here and all they do is sit around. They don’t play baseball. I decided to do a professional team with only young guys.” The oldest player on RA12’s roster was 26-year-old free agent Eddy Reynoso, who spent four years (2015-18) in the Red Sox’s minor-league system, and of the 39 players on the greater roster, 17 were born in 2000 or later. Most are affiliated with Major League Baseball teams but none had major-league experience. If you look at the league’s website, you’ll see familiar names like Christian Colon and T.J. Rivera and Hector Santiago on other teams. Puerto Rico is well represented in the big leagues right now by Lindor, his new teammate Edwin Diaz, Cubs shortstop Javier Baez and Astros shortstop Carlos Correa, among others, yet the greater a pipeline it can become, the better. “It’s all opportunity,” Alomar said. “The more you play, the more you learn.” He’s in this for the long haul, with the hope that the coronavirus vaccine will allow for a longer schedule, paying fans and scouts in the stands and more sponsors next year. That, no matter the team’s record, would be a big win.” Let’s catch up on Pop Quiz questions.

34,Pro-statehood Pedro Pierluisi sworn in as new Puerto Rico governor,Mary Kay Linge,2021-01-02,"Pedro Pierluisi became the governor of Puerto Rico Saturday — again — 16 months after he was bounced out of the job by the US commonwealth’s supreme court. The longtime politician, 61, who heads the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, was elected in November in a six-way gubernatorial race with only 33 percent of the vote, after trouncing the sitting governor, Wanda Vázquez, in an August primary contest. In 2019, Pierluisi served a six-day stint as Puerto Rico’s de facto governor during the chaotic period after Gov. Ricardo Rosselló was forced out of office by mass protests over insulting text messages he had sent. But after less than a week, Puerto Rico’s supreme court ruled that Pierluisi, who had been appointed to the position of secretary of state but not confirmed by the island’s legislature, could not legally serve as Rosselló’s successor. This time, Pierluisi took the oath of office in an outdoor ceremony in San Juan before 400 invited guests — all of whom, he promised this week, had to test negative for coronavirus before attending. Pierluisi’s pro-statehood stance could have major implications for US politics, as left-leaning Democrats increasingly clamor to make the commonwealth the 51st state — a change that would add two seats to the US Senate and likely increase Democratic strength there. “I’m very keen to start working,” Pierluisi told reporters Saturday, with plans to begin signing executive orders this weekend.

36,Shocking video shows collapse of iconic telescope in Puerto Rico,"Elizabeth Elizalde, Jesse O’Neill",2020-12-03,"Shocking video released Thursday shows the moment the iconic Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico plunged 400 feet into a huge dish when its cables snapped. The large telescope — which had been used for astronomical discoveries and even led to Nobel Peace Prize-winning research — fell apart when its three support towers broke Tuesday morning. Video released by the National Science Foundation shows the observatory’s platform crashing down into to the dish antenna while the support towers and cables snapped, causing debris to disperse everywhere. The 900-ton telescope was already damaged and had been scheduled for demolition after two cables broke in August and November. Scientists and students from all over the world used the 57-year-old telescope for research purposes, including research that won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1993. Ángel Vázquez, the observatory’s director of telescope operations, says he was in the control room area removing expensive equipment from the facility Tuesday morning when he heard a loud bang. “When we looked outside the control room, we started to see the eventual downfall of the observatory,” Vázquez said, adding that strands of cables had been unraveling in recent days and increasing strain on the platform. “This whole process took 30 seconds,” Vázquez said, “and an unfortunate icon in radio astronomy was done.” The Arecibo Observatory was completed in 1963, and its powerful capabilities attracted researchers chasing breakthroughs in radio astronomy and atmospheric science. It was used to detect the first binary pulsar, discover gravitational waves in space and search for potentially habitable planets in other galaxies. The Observatory has also been a source of inspiration on the silver screen, staring alongside Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond and Jodie Foster in the films ‘GoldenEye’ and ‘Contact.’ In 1974, it was used to beam a “Hello, world” message into space, to communicate with extra terrestrial life. Before the collapse, members of Congress and the scientific community lobbied for the observatory to be saved. Now, many are pushing for the rebuilding of the structure — but this could take some time. “With regards to replacement, NSF has a very well-defined process for funding and constructing large-scale infrastructure, including telescopes,” said Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s Division of Astronomical Sciences. “It’s a multi-year process that involves congressional appropriations and the assessment and needs of the scientific community. So, it’s very early for us to comment on the replacement.” No injuries were reported in the crash.

37,"Huge Puerto Rico radio telescope, already damaged, collapses",Elizabeth Elizalde,2020-12-01,"An iconic large telescope in Puerto Rico that’s been used for astronomical discoveries and even led to Nobel Peace Prize-winning research collapsed Tuesday ahead of its planned demolition. The telescope’s 900 ton platform at the Arecibo Observatory plummeted into a dish underneath — causing its three support towers and cables to break off — shortly before 8 a.m., according to the National Science Foundation. “We are saddened by this situation but thankful that no one was hurt,” NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement. “When engineers advised NSF that the structure was unstable and presented a danger to work teams and Arecibo staff, we took their warnings seriously and continued to emphasize the importance of safety for everyone involved. “Our focus is now on assessing the damage, finding ways to restore operations at other parts of the observatory, and working to continue supporting the scientific community, and the people of Puerto Rico,” Panchanathan added. In August, a cable from the 305-meter telescope broke and another one in early November. On Nov. 19, the NSF announced it would be demolishing the observatory over safety concerns. The Arecibo Observatory had been in operation for 57 years and was used by scientists and students from all over the world for research purposes. The telescope was used in research that won a Nobel Prize in physics in 1993. Abel Mendez, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo who teaches physics and astrobiology, said the large structure was very meaningful in his life. “I am one of those students who visited it when young and got inspired,” Mendez said. “The world without the observatory loses, but Puerto Rico loses even more.” With Post wires ",https://nypost.com/2020/12/01/huge-puerto-rico-radio-telescope-already-damaged-collapses/,New York Post,Conservative
38,"Famed Puerto Rico telescope to close in blow to science, search for extraterrestrial life.",Associated Press,2020-11-20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that it will close the huge telescope at the renowned Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in a blow to scientists worldwide who depend on it to search for planets, asteroids and extraterrestrial life. The independent, federally funded agency said it’s too dangerous to keep operating the single dish radio telescope — one of the world’s largest — given the significant damage it recently sustained. An auxiliary cable broke in August and tore a 100-foot hole in the reflector dish and damaged the dome above it. Then on Nov. 6, one of the telescope’s main steel cables snapped, leading officials to warn that the entire structure could collapse. NSF officials noted that even if crews were to repair all the damage, engineers found that the structure would still be unstable in the long term. “This decision is not an easy one for NSF to make, but the safety of people is our number one priority,” said Sean Jones, the agency’s assistant director for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. “We understand how much Arecibo means to this community and to Puerto Rico.” He said the goal was to preserve the telescope without placing people at risk, but, “we have found no path forward to allow us to do so safely.” The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. In its 57 years of operation, it endured hurricanes, endless humidity and a recent string of strong earthquakes. The telescope boasts a 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish featured in the Jodie Foster film “Contact” and the James Bond movie “GoldenEye.” Scientists worldwide have used the dish along with the 900-ton platform hanging 450 feet above it to track asteroids on a path to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable. In recent years, the NSF-owned facility has been managed by the University of Central Florida. Alex Wolszczan, a Polish-born astronomer and professor at Pennsylvania State University who helped discover the first extrasolar and pulsar planets, told The Associated Press that while the news wasn’t surprising, it was disappointing. He worked at the telescope in the 1980s and early 1990s. “I was hoping against hope that they would come up with some kind of solution to keep it open,” he said. “For a person who has had a lot of his scientific life associated with that telescope, this is a rather interesting and sadly emotional moment.” The announcement saddened many beyond the scientific world as well, with the hashtag #WhatAreciboMeansToMe popping up on Twitter along with pictures of people working, visiting and even getting married or celebrating a birthday at the telescope. Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s Division of Astronomical Sciences, stressed that the decision has nothing to do with the observatory’s capabilities, which have allowed scientists to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed. “The telescope is currently at serious risk of unexpected, uncontrolled collapse,” he said. “Even attempts at stabilization or testing the cables could result in accelerating the catastrophic failure.” Officials suspect a potential manufacturing error is to blame for the auxiliary cable that snapped after a socket holding it failed, but say they are surprised that a main cable broke about three months later given that it was supporting only about 60 percent of its capacity. Engineers had assessed the situation after the first cable broke, noting that about 12 of the roughly 160 wires of the second cable that eventually broke had already snapped, said Ashley Zauderer, program officer for Arecibo Observatory at NSF. “It was identified as an issue that needed to be addressed, but it wasn’t seen as an immediate threat,” she said. She and other NSF officials said that all standard maintenance procedures had been followed. The closure is a blow for many of the more than 250 scientists that have used a telescope that is also considered one of Puerto Rico’s main tourist attractions, drawing some 90,000 visitors a year. It also has long served as a training ground for hundreds of graduate students. “It was my Disney,” wrote Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Texas, in a series of tweets. He recalled first visiting when he was 4 or 5. “Think about what the Golden Gate Bridge means to San Francisco, Statue of Liberty to New Yorkers. Arecibo is this and more to Puerto Rico because it has gone beyond an icon.” The NSF said it intends to restore operations at the observatory’s remaining assets including its two LIDAR facilities, one of which is located in the nearby island of Culebra. Those are used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research, including analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data. Officials also aim to resume operations at the visitor center. Wolszczan, the astronomer, said the value of the telescope won’t instantly disappear because he and many other scientists are still working on projects based on observations and data taken from the observatory. “The process of saying goodbye to Arecibo will certainly take some years,” he said. “It won’t be instantaneous.” ",https://nypost.com/2020/11/20/huge-puerto-rico-radio-telescope-to-close-in-blow-to-science/,New York Post,Conservative

41,Wild video captures moment brawl erupts on Spirit flight to Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2020-10-28,"A passenger aboard a Spirit Airlines flight from New Jersey to Puerto Rico captured a wild brawl that erupted when the plane landed in San Juan, where a woman who reportedly refused to wear a mask was tased by cops. The woman — identified as Nyasy Veronique Payne — “provoked an incident by acting in what witnesses called an aggressive, hostile, & defiant behavior,” Puerto Rico police said, according to CBS Lead National Correspondent David Begnaud. The mayhem erupted about 7 p.m. Sunday at the Luis Munoz Marin Airport, where the woman allegedly struck 28-year-old Javier Lopez Cruz, Begnaud said on Twitter. Another passenger recorded the melee in which the woman, who is wearing a mask around her chin, is seen yelling at a man in a white T-shirt. “Stop! Stop! Calm down!” someone is heard shouting during the free-for-all as the woman tries to attack the man before she is zapped. In a series of tweets, Begnaud said he spoke to a passenger named Alfredo, who told him the aggressor had been punched before she went on the offensive. “Alfredo says during the flight, a young man was moving about the plane, switching seats and not wearing a mask. Flight attendants, according to Alfredo, instructed the man to stop switching seats & to wear his mask,” he wrote. “The man didn’t stop. When the plane landed police were called,” Begnaud added. Alfredo told the reporter that three women who appeared to be traveling with the man also were not wearing masks — and were moving about the cabin while the seatbelt sign was on. “The flights [sic] attendants — Alfredo says — asked the women to stay seated a [sic] wear a mask,” he wrote. Apparently, the violence began upon landing when three male passengers began yelling racist and homophobic slurs at the three black women, including Payne, who retaliated, according to Alfredo. Although she may have acted in self-defense initially, she reportedly continued attacking passengers, according to reports. Payne was spent the night in the slammer and her bail was set at $150,000, according to onemileatatime.com. The Post has reached out to Spirit Airlines for comment.

40,Puerto Rico scraps safe-sex campaign urging people to masturbate during pandemic,Natalie O'Neill,2020-10-28,"Puerto Rico’s health department scrapped a safe sex campaign urging people to masturbate to avoid contracting the coronavirus — after conservative critics said the message rubbed them the wrong way. The public service announcement, which launched on social media Tuesday, featured an image of a thumb fondling a grapefruit next to a statement proclaiming that pleasuring oneself is the only truly safe form of sexual activity in a pandemic. It also urged horndogs to wash their sex toys, along with their hands, and avoid getting frisky with anyone not living under their roof. But government health officials quickly erased the post after it went viral, explaining it had offended some observers. “Although our only intention is to educate and prevent, the publication was offensive to some sectors of the population,” the Health Department said in a statement. Officials said they didn’t want the campaign’s main message — which was validated by epidemiologists and other health officials — to get lost in the distraction of a potential controversy. Still, one expert called the campaign solid advice, even if left some folks hot and bothered. “In principle, it seems like a good idea,” said Mónica Feliú-Mójer, a spokeswoman for CienciaPR, a nonprofit that reps scientists in the country.  “[But] it seems they didn’t anticipate there was going to be this backlash when Puerto Rico is truly very conservative regarding these issues.” Safe sex campaigns have been rare on the island and in largely-Catholic Latin America in general. The island nation, which is home to 3.2 million people, has reported 32,400 COVID-19 cases, and more than 800 deaths this year.

It is Donald Trump.”Vázquez Garced has served as Puerto Rico’s governor since Aug. 2019. She was set to appear at a Trump campaign rally in Florida last week prior to the president’s announcement that he had tested positive for coronavirus. It’s unclear when Trump will be able to return to the campaign trail.The governor dismissed criticism related to a 2017 incident in which Trump was caught on video throwing paper towels to a crowd of Puerto Rican residents following Hurricane Maria, arguing that “no one is perfect.”“Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced’s endorsement is further proof of the enthusiasm that President Trump is generating among Boricuas and all Hispanics,” said Trump Victory Spokesperson Danielle Alvarez in a statement obtained by the Miami Herald.Last month, the Trump administration unveiled a $13 billion aid package to help Puerto Rico in its ongoing recovery from Hurricane Maria. The White House said the package would “help rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical grid system and spur recovery of the territory’s education system.”At the time, the Biden campaign criticized the aid package as an attempt to secure more votes ahead of the election.“This is clearly a desperate, political stunt to win over Puerto Rican supporters.

""They can start by inviting territories bound by federal law but lacking voting representation in Congress to become states.""Jentleson specifically suggested Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., as new states.Ending the filibuster would almost certainly be needed to do this because it would lower the bar for the number of Senate votes needed to pass legislation. While current rules require 60 votes to end debate and move forward on a bill, removing the filibuster would mean only a simple majority of 51 votes would be needed.While Jentleson discussed adding states in the context of it being a possible response to Republicans pushing through a new Supreme Court justice, there is reason to believe that Democrats would push for this even if Republicans waited.House Democrats already passed a bill in June that would make D.C. a state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the bill would right a ""grave injustice which is an affront to our democracy."" A House bill granting statehood to Puerto Rico was introduced in October 2019.Democratic victories in the White House and Senate would make statehood more likely to become a reality, but removing the filibuster would most likely need to be the first step.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned what could happen if his party loses their majority in the Senate.""The American people should know what it means if the Senate shifts control,” McConnell said. “D.C. statehood.

An additional $2 billion goes to the territory's Department of Education to restore school buildings and educational facilities.""With the grant awards announced today, the Federal Government will have obligated approximately $26 billion for Puerto Rico’s recovery from Hurricane Maria,"" the White House said.. ""Today’s grant announcements represent some of the largest awards in FEMA’s history for any single disaster recovery event and demonstrate in the Federal Government’s continuing commitment to help rebuild the territory and support the citizens of Puerto Rico and their recovery goals.""It comes after President Trump last week approved a disaster declaration for the island, following Hurricane Isaias over the summer. That declaration made funding available to affected areas for housing, loans to cover uninsured property losses and to help individuals and businesses recover.But the territory had still been recovering from the aftermath of Maria, particularly due to its outdated energy system -- which had been wrecked by the hurricane.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a statement Friday morning, said the funds were “overdue” and criticized the response by the Trump administration.“Long before the hurricanes, Puerto Rico had a crumbling and dirty energy grid. After the storms utterly destroyed the grid, it created an opportunity to rebuild a cleaner, cheaper and more resilient energy system, but the Trump administration dithered and delayed and refused to deliver timely disaster aid for the people of Puerto Rico,” he said.“I will work with the Puerto Rican community to see that these long overdue and desperately needed funds are put to use in a wise way building the cleaner and more resilient energy grid the island deserves.”The move comes as polls for the presidental race show a tight race in Florida between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.

US Customs and Border Patrol officers were conducting a search of the Norma H II docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico, when their K-9 alerted them to pallets containing home moving boxes en route to St. Thomas, authorities said. After officers opened one of the boxes, they found greenbacks wrapped in vacuum-sealed packages,  according to a statement from the Department of Justice. Further inspection of the pallets revealed a total of 34 cargo boxes containing the stacks of undeclared cash. W. Stephen Muldrow, US attorney for the District of Puerto Rico, said the territory’s geographical location has made it an ideal hub to import narcotics into the US mainland and to smuggle drug money. “To eradicate this threat, we will continue to aggressively attack their drug smuggling and money laundering operations — depriving them of their illegal merchandise, their profits, and a safe haven,” said Muldrow, who did not elaborate on how the massive seizure was linked to narcotics trafficking operations. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent A.J. Collazo said that most likely more than one criminal organization was involved and now “seriously bleeding” from the financial loss.

45,AOC slammed by fellow NY House Democrat over bill on Puerto Rico’s status,Emily Jacobs,2020-08-27,"A new bill from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that aims to address the future of Puerto Rico’s territory status is being slammed by a fellow Puerto Rican House Democrat from New York. Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) introduced a bill Tuesday with Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-NY) offering an unconventional approach for Puerto Rico to decide on its sovereign status: through a convention. AOC, who is of Puerto Rican descent, and Velázquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, explained in an op-ed published by NBC News that the legislation “would prompt Puerto Rico’s Legislature to create a Status Convention whose delegates would be elected by Puerto Rican voters. “This body would develop a long-term solution for Puerto Rico’s status, be that statehood, independence, free association or any option other than the current territorial arrangement,” the two lawmakers added. Rep. José E. Serrano (D-NY), who is also Puerto Rican, took to Twitter after the bill was introduced to voice his disapproval, warning that it would leave major decisions up to “a club of elites” instead of Puerto Rican voters. “I believe that all Puerto Ricans should help determine the future of the island — not just a few,” Serrano wrote on the social media platform. “Changing Puerto Rico’s status (a career goal of mine) is too important to be left behind closed doors — all Puerto Ricans should have a say.” “I have always supported an end to the colonial commonwealth status. The horrific inequities and harms of the past few years have made clear why Puerto Rico needs either statehood or independence. But that choice shouldn’t be limited to a club of elites,” he continued. Previously, island-wide referendums have taken place to determine what citizens would like to see for the future of the island, which was established as a US territory in 1898. Serrano, 76, has Parkinson’s disease and is not running for re-election. He has introduced multiple bills that have been unsuccessful on the issue of Puerto Rico’s statehood, most recently in 2019. That bill has languished in the House since October. Serrano’s likely successor, Ritchie Torres, a New York City councilman who won the Democratic primary to replace him in the heavily blue district, said in a tweet that he agreed. “Wise words from a public servant of incomparable integrity. I am honored to continue your tradition of advocating for true self-determination through direct elections. All Puerto Ricans, not simply party insiders, should have a voice and a vote!” Torres tweeted in response. Torres’ father is Puerto Rican.

46,Puerto Rico holds second voting round after chaotic primaries,Associated Press,2020-08-16,"LOÍZA, Puerto Rico — Thousands of Puerto Ricans on Sunday got a second chance to vote for the first time, a week after delayed and missing ballots marred the original primaries in a blow to the U.S. territory’s democracy. More than 60 of the island’s 110 precincts opened following a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that stated a second round of voting would take place at centers that never opened on Aug. 9 or did not remain open the required eight hours. The opening of at least one voting center in the north coastal town of Loíza was delayed by more than one hour as dozens of voters grumbled about having to stand in the heat with masks over their faces. “We expected that there wouldn’t be any problems,” said Santiago Jiménez, a 68-year-old retiree, adding that some people left. “We’re all frustrated.” Jannette Ledoux, coordinator for the unit where the voting center was located, told The Associated Press that the problem was a result of four volunteers quitting late Saturday, delaying the required ballot counting before the doors opened. She said the center would remain open late to meet the required eight hours. Once voting got underway, one elderly woman emerged after casting her ballot and yelled to those waiting, “Come on! Come on! Let’s vote! Let’s vote!” But not everyone could participate in Sunday’s second round. The Supreme Court’s ruling permanently left out voters like Eldy Correa, a 67-year-old retiree who went to her voting center in the southwest town of Cabo Rojo three times last Sunday and desisted only to find out later that it opened late. “They took away our right to vote,” she said, adding that she was upset with the president of the elections commission despite his apologies. “Sorry for what? That doesn’t resolve anything.” The primaries for the pro-statehood New Progressive Party pit Gov. Wanda Vázquez against Pedro Pierluisi, who was Puerto Rico’s representative to Congress from 2009 to 2017. He also briefly served as governor after former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned last year following huge protests sparked by a profanity-laced chat that was leaked. However, the island’s Supreme Court ruled that Vázquez, former justice secretary at the time, was next-in-line to become governor since there was no secretary of state. Meanwhile, three candidates are running for the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General William Barr asking that his department investigate the debacle. Puerto Rico Sen. Eduardo Bhatia is running against Isabela Mayor Carlos Delgado and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, known for her public spats with U.S. President Donald Trump. The two main parties also have demanded that elections commission president Juan Ernesto Dávila resign. Dávila has said it would be irresponsible to do so amid the primaries, and that he would only consider the petition afterward. Officials have blamed the chaos of the Aug. 9 primaries on ballots arriving late to the elections commission and trucks laden with materials not leaving until the day of the primaries, when usually they depart one or two days before. Dávila has said the ballots arrived late because of the pandemic, Tropical Storm Isaias and a last-minute request from both parties to print more of them. Officials from both parties said Sunday that all ballots arrived on time and that no serious delays were reported. But Irma Muñoz, a 72-year-old retiree standing in line as she gulped water, said she was wary. “Good God, I hope my vote counts,” she said. “If they only knew about our sacrifice.” ",https://nypost.com/2020/08/16/puerto-rico-holds-second-voting-round-after-chaotic-primaries/,New York Post,Conservative
27,"Martha McSally warns that Biden, Dems would make DC, Puerto Rico states",Morgan Phillips   ,2020-08-12,"Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., said Tuesday that if Joe Biden wins the presidential race and Democrats retake control of both houses of Congress, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., would gain statehood.McSally warned that if Democrats win full control of Washington, they will vote to give Puerto Rico and D.C. full voting rights on Capitol Hill via statehood, making it impossible for Republicans to ever regain control.“They're going to make D.C. and Puerto Rico a state and get four new Democrat Senators. We'd never get the Senate back again,” the Arizona Republican said.“They are going to ram through the most radical left agenda we’ve seen in history,” McSally told MSNBC’s Vaughn Hillyard.In June, the House passed a D.C. statehood bill for the first time, but the bill is presumed dead on arrival in the current Republican-controlled Senate. If D.C. were to become the 51st state, it would gain two voting Senators and one voting House member to represent its 700,000 population. D.C. has voted Democrat in the presidential election ever since it gained three Electoral College votes in 1961.Puerto Rico’s politics are harder to gauge -- its two major political parties break over the island’s political status -- whether to seek statehood or whether to remain a territory -- rather than the U.S.-based Republican-Democrat divide. Still, a November 2018 poll found that the mainland favored Democrats 70 percent to 27 percent in the midterm elections.McSally was appointed to fill the open Senate seat of the late Sen. John McCain in 2018 after losing to Democrat Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. She is facing off to keep her seat against Democrat Mark Kelly in 2020. She said the Democrats’ “radical left agenda” is “so out of touch with Arizonans” that her opponent is “hiding and trying to pretend he’s not a Democrat.”McSally’s seat is one of the Democrats’ top targets this year, and she is among the most vulnerable of GOP senators up for reelection. A new Arizona Public Opinion Pulse survey showed Kelly leading McSally 48 to 43 percent. Kelly maintains a significant lead with Arizona’s independent voters, of which the state has 1.2 million. The survey shows Kelly garnering 47 percent of independent voters to McSally’s 34 percent.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcsally-biden-dems-dc-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative

The University of Central Florida, which manages the National Science Foundation facility, said in a statement that a cable that helps support a metal platform broke and caused a 100-foot (30-meter) gash on a reflector dish. The university said eight panels in the dome also were damaged and the platform used to access the dome is now twisted. The statement said it was unclear why the cable broke. The cost of the damage wasn’t immediately known. Scientists worldwide use the telescope to detect radio emissions emitted by objects such as stars and galaxies.

It remains too early to say for sure which way the storm will go.As it advances, “interests in Cuba and the Florida peninsula should monitor the progress of this system,” the hurricane center is advising.The hurricane center also says Isaias, for now, is not expected to become a hurricane before reaching the U.S. mainland.“Isaias is sending some mixed signals,” the forecast discussion stated. “Model forecasts are showing a complex evolution of the tropical cyclone during the next day or two.”In the meantime, tropical storm warnings were issued for Puerto Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands and portions of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the Bahamas.Isaias is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain across the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos, and also across Puerto Rico, northern Haiti and eastern Cuba, with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches.The Dominican Republic and the Bahamas could see 4 to 8 inches of rain while Cuba could see 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches.Isaias has broken the record as the earliest ninth Atlantic named storm, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The previous record was Irene on Aug. 7, 2005, he tweeted.So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard, Fay, Gert and Hanna also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storm for their alphabetic order.. ",https://www.foxnews.com/science/tropical-storm-isaias-forms-near-puerto-rico-florida-track-shifts-reports,Fox,Conservative

Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Washington D.C. are now added to the list,” he said. “Puerto Rico is also added to the list. So, that means we’re now 34 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico who are on the quarantine list.” Over half the country, plus Puerto Rico and the nation’s capital were added to the list after their virus data blew past New York, New Jersey and Connecticut’s guidelines set in late June. A state is added if their data shows a positive coronavirus test rate higher than 10 per 10,000 residents over a seven-day rolling average, or a 10 percent or higher positivity rate over the same time frame.

31,Worsening drought forces state of emergency in Puerto Rico,,2020-06-30," Puerto Rico’s governor on Monday declared a state of emergency as a worsening drought creeps across the U.S. territory amid the coronavirus pandemic.Starting July 2, nearly 140,000 clients, including some in the capital of San Juan, will be without water for 24 hours every other day as part of strict rationing measures. Puerto Rico's utilities urged people to not stockpile water excessively, because it would worsen the situation.Officials asked that everyone use masks and maintain social distancing if they seek water from one of 23 water trucks set up across the island.“We're asking people to please use moderation,” said Doriel Pagán, executive director of Puerto Rico's Water and Sewer Authority, adding that she could not say how long the rationing will last.Fernanda Ramos, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service in San Juan, said ongoing dry conditions will be interrupted by thunderstorms on the island Wednesday and Thursday.""However, we are not expecting enough rain... to solve the problem we’re seeing,” she said.More than 26 percent of the island is experiencing a severe drought and another 60 percent is under a moderate drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.Gov. Wanda Vázquez said 21 of 78 municipalities are affected by the severe drought while another 29 by the moderate drought. An additional 12 municipalities face abnormally dry conditions. The worst of the drought is concentrated in Puerto Rico's southern region, which continues to be affected by aftershocks following a 6.0-magnitude earthquake that hit in early January and caused millions in damage.An administrative order signed Monday prohibits certain activities in most municipalities including watering gardens during daylight hours, filling pools, and using a hose or non-recycled water to wash cars. Those caught could be fined.Vázquez's announcement comes amid criticism that her administration has not dredged reservoirs, which would eliminate sediment and avoid excess loss of water. Pagán said the utility spoke with the Federal Emergency Management Agency since Hurricane Maria about a $300 million dredging investment. She blamed the lengthy process on the number of studies needed.The upcoming water rationing measures will affect clients connected to the Carraízo reservoir, one of 11 that Puerto Rico's government operates. Pagán said that reservoir was last dredged in the late 1990s. Officials have already taken other measures, including activating water wells and transferring more than 30,000 clients from Carraízo to another reservoir.The utility is restructuring a portion of its multibillion-dollar debt and suspended all capital improvement projects, including dredging, as a result of its fiscal woes. Natalie Jaresko, executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances amid a deep economic crisis, said Monday that up to 60 percent of water is wasted, lost or stolen.An upcoming project to install meters at the company’s production facilities is expected to improve the situation, and the board has approved a fiscal plan for the utilities company that calls for dredging projects. However, the company has final say on whether it will carry out those projects and what kind of funding it would use.Puerto Rico last experienced a punishing drought five years ago that affected 2.5 million people and led to severe water rationing measures. During that time, some 400,000 utility customers received water only every third day.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/worsening-drought-forces-state-of-emergency-in-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative
32,Supreme Court upholds Obama appointment of oversight board dealing with Puerto Rico's financial crisis,Ronn Blitzer,2020-06-01,"The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the authority of a special government board with oversight to deal with Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring, which came after a devastating financial crisis.The court unanimously ruled that the board members were not federal officers whose appointments required Senate confirmation because their duties were locally focused.“The Board’s statutory responsibilities consist of primarily local duties, namely, representing Puerto Rico in bankruptcy proceedings and supervising aspects of Puerto Rico’s fiscal and budgetary policies,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the court’s opinion. “We therefore find that the Board members are not 'Officers of the United States.'”The court likened this to when Congress creates local government offices in Puerto Rico.“Congress has both made local law directly and also created structures of local government, staffed by local officials, who themselves have made and enforced local law,” Breyer’s opinion said. “This structure suggests that when Congress creates local offices using these two unique powers, the officers exercise power of the local government, not the Federal Government.”Several hedge funds that had invested in the commonwealth’s bonds had challenged the makeup and the oversight responsibilities of the board. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the board’s appointment was unconstitutional but that their actions prior to the legal challenge would remain in effect.The Supreme Court now reverses the First Circuit, allowing the board to move ahead and try to help the island territory recover from the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.Fox News’ Bill Mears contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-upholds-obama-appointment-of-oversight-board-dealing-with-puerto-ricos-financial-crisis,Fox,Conservative
33,Puerto Rico to hold referendum on statehood in November,Peter Aitken   ,2020-05-17,"Puerto Rico will hold a nonbinding referendum to decide the issue of Puerto Rico’s statehood, the governor announced. The referendum will be held in November and will ask a single, simple question: Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted as a U.S. state? “Our people will have the opportunity once and for all to define our future,” Vázquez said. “It’s never too late to be treated as equals.”Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and, while its residents are U.S. citizens, they cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. Though the island is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes and receives less federal funding than U.S. states.Puerto Rico has struggled in recent years to obtain federal funds for a series of disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes and the coronavirus pandemic. Even if citizens vote for statehood, it would still be an uphill battle as the U.S. Congress would need to approve Puerto Rico’s admission. Still, the governor’s pro-statehood party is confident that the referendum will pass. “Everything important in life carries some risk,” said former Puerto Rico Gov. Carlos Romero Barceló, a member of the Progressive New Party.The question has outraged the island’s small group of independence supporters and members of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo. Roberto Prats, a former Puerto Rico senator and member of the Popular Democratic Party, said in a phone interview that the upcoming referendum will be an exercise in futility like the five previous ones.“The only thing they’ve done is take away credibility from the statehood movement,” he said, adding that Puerto Rico has eroded the federal government’s trust with its decades of corruption and mismanagement and that any referendum should first have support from Congress. “If we’re going to make a decision regarding our relationship with the U.S., the U.S. has to be involved in that discussion.”.

52,Coronavirus shows US needs to restore pharmaceutical production — in Puerto Rico,Post Editorial Board,2020-03-07,"Though coronavirus has only begun to show up in America, it’s already exposed the nation’s serious over-reliance on China for pharmaceutical production. As Washington looks to address that, it should consider killing two birds with one stone by using the issue as a chance to give Puerto Rico a leg up. After all, the island was for decades a central hub of US drug manufacturing. It would do the commonwealth and the mainland a world of good to restore that preeminence. About 90 percent of the active ingredients (manufactured “precursors”) used by US drugmakers now come from China. With that country’s factories largely shut down by the outbreak, America’s pharmaceutical supplies are at risk even as the virus hits here. The Food and Drug Administration fears a shortage of widely used generic drugs. Moving to ensure some domestic capacity for future crises is a no-brainer. And boosting Puerto Rico, now struggling with a debt crisis plus hurricane and earthquake damage, should be one, too. In the 1970s, Congress passed tax breaks for companies that set up shop in Puerto Rico. Drugmakers took advantage and soon made the island one of the world’s top pharma-production centers. But President Bill Clinton signed a law to start phasing out the tax breaks in the 1990s. Once they expired fully in 2006, the industry began a major pullout from the island. “Not coincidentally,” the Tax Foundation noted in 2015, “2006 marked the beginning of a deep recession for Puerto Rico, which has lasted until today.” That killed tax revenues and led to under-investment in infrastructure, such as the electric grid — which collapsed when Hurricane Maria hit. Though we generally oppose these kinds of targeted tax breaks, there’s a clear need for a national-security exception here. And Puerto Rico, which suffers from other mainland laws like Jones Act shipping restrictions, deserves offsetting support. About $70 billion in debt, with no real way to pay it back, Puerto Rico may be on the brink of declaring a second bankruptcy (the first came in 2017) if it can’t finalize a deal with bondholders to trim its public debt 70 percent. Restoring the Puerto Rican tax break for pharma production would boost America’s security and give a hand to an island of more than 3 million US citizens. How about it, Washington?

53,Have you traveled to the world’s fastest-growing tourist destinations?,Hannah Sparks,2020-02-03,"Wanderlust is on the rise, and that’s leading to a shake-up among the word’s most traveled tourist destinations. Trips abroad were up 4 percent in 2019 with 1.5 billion flights overseas compared to 2018, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Traditionally popular travel destinations remained at the top of the list, such as France with more than 90 million visitors in 2019 and Spain with 83.8 million. However, their list of the fastest-growing tourist go-tos — which included war-torn nations and regions recently ravaged by natural disaster — revealed some surprise hits among vacationers last year, the Independent reported. Myanmar (formerly Burma) saw the highest spike in tourists with a 40.2% increase, followed by Puerto Rico, who welcomed a 31.2% jump despite the devastation of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, from which the US territory continues to recover. Embattled Iran came in third with a 27.9% rise in tourism, though its standing is expected to drop following the killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani by US military. This trend was reflected in data from countries such as Sri Lanka, where terror attacks over Easter last year contributed to an 18% drop in tourism. Hong Kong, too, took a 18.8% hit, most likely due to ongoing protests against their government. But there’s hope for Iran to rise again, as countries such as Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have all made comebacks since suffering widespread terror attacks during the past few years.

54,Puerto Rico only reopens some public schools amid ongoing quakes,Associated Press,2020-01-28,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico opened only 20 percent of its public schools on Tuesday following a strong earthquake that delayed the start of classes by nearly three weeks as fears linger over the safety of students. Only 177 schools were certified to open after engineers inspected them for damage caused by the magnitude-6.4 earthquake that killed one person and damaged hundreds of homes on Jan. 7. But the inspections were not to determine whether a school could withstand another strong earthquake or had structural shortcomings such as short columns that make it vulnerable to collapse, further worrying parents. “Of course I am afraid,” said 38-year-old Marién Santos, who attended an open house on Monday at her son’s Ramón Vilá Mayo high school in the suburb of Río Piedras where officials gave her a copy of the inspection report and evacuation plans. Her concerns were echoed by the director of the school, Elisa Delgado. While she believes engineers did a thorough inspection of the school, built in the early 1900s, they warned her not to use the main entrance in an evacuation because it leads to an area filled with gas lines. The problem is that the other exits are too narrow to handle the school’s 450 students, she told The Associated Press. “It’s not ideal,” she said. Overall, engineers have inspected 561 of the island’s 856 public schools, finding at least 50 too unsafe to reopen, leaving some 240,000 students out of school for now. Ongoing tremors also are forcing crews to automatically re-inspect schools following any quake of 3.0 magnitude or higher, according to Puerto Rico’s Infrastructure Financing Authority. Since the 6.4 quake, there have been several strong aftershocks, including a 5.9 magnitude one that hit on Jan. 11 and a 5.0 that struck on Saturday. The biggest quake flattened the top two floors of a three-story school in the southern coastal city of Guánica on Jan. 7, two days before classes were scheduled to start. Overall, experts say that some 500 public schools in Puerto Rico were built before 1987 and don’t meet new construction codes. A plan to retrofit all schools that need it, an estimated 756 buildings, would cost up to $2.5 billion, officials have said, noting those are preliminary figures. Education Secretary Eligio Hernández noted that another 51 schools are scheduled to start classes on Feb. 3 and that his department is reviewing recommendations on how best to proceed with the other schools. “The Department of Education is going to take the time it needs and will take all necessary actions so that parents … feel satisfied,” he told reporters on Monday. Elba Aponte, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Teachers, told the AP that she has received complaints and pictures from parents and school employees of at least 10 schools that are reopening but that they feel are still unsafe. Most of the pictures are of cracks in the walls and roofs of those schools, she said. “Their concerns are quite valid,” Aponte said, adding that she would share them with the island’s education secretary. Meanwhile, school and government officials are trying to figure out what to do with the roughly 240,000 students who aren’t able to go to school yet, either because their building was deemed unsafe or has not yet been inspected. No schools in the island’s southern and southwest region will reopen for now, officials say. Options include placing students in other schools with revised schedules or holding classes in refurbished trailers or outdoors under tarps, Aponte said as she lamented the situation. “It’s terrible,” she said. “If there was one place where they could feel safe, it was at school.” ",https://nypost.com/2020/01/28/puerto-rico-only-reopens-some-public-schools-amid-ongoing-quakes/,New York Post,Conservative
35,Rescued pets from earthquake-ravaged Puerto Rico end up at East Coast shelters,Katie Byrne   ,2020-01-22,"WEST CHESTER, Pa.  More than 100 shelter dogs and cats from Puerto Rico are now up for adoption at animal rescue organizations along the East Coast. On Sunday, they were flown in on an emergency evacuation flight after a series of earthquakes devastated the island. The flight was organized by a non-profit in Puerto Rico called The Sato Project and Los-Angeles based Wings of Rescue. “It’s a cargo plane that’s rented but it is all temperature-controlled. The animals each come with bedding. They’ve got water in their crates that’s frozen as ice,” said Linda Torelli, Marketing Director of the Brandywine Valley SPCA.The flight carrying the 116 animals made stops in Delaware, New Jersey, and Florida. The animals have now been relocated to shelters in those states as well as Pennsylvania and New York. “It’s goosebumps and tears. The minute you hear those doors open. It’s just an incredible feeling knowing those animals may not have been alive had it not been for that mission,” said Torelli.The Brandywine Valley SPCA in West Chester, Pennsylvania took in more than 30 dogs from the flight. ""There’s a huge variety that came up on the flight. We’ve got little babies all the way up to adults of about five to six years old,"" said Torelli.According to Torelli, the dogs range in age, size, and personality.“We came to look at some of the dogs and we found one that we like,” said Julie Oakley.After reading about the new pets from Puerto Rico on social media, the Oakley family went to the shelter on Tuesday.“I’ve been following the SPCA and different rescues for a while on Facebook, so I saw they were bringing in a bunch of dogs from Puerto Rico,” said Oakley. Ultimately, they went home with Zule, the first Puerto Rico earthquake survivor at the shelter to find a new home. “It just makes me feel good to rescue dogs,” Oakley said. SPCA officials say the animals would have likely been euthanized because of limited space and a lack of food and water on the island.“It’s heartbreaking to me,” said Chrissy Beckles, the president and founder of The Sato Project. Beckles is one of the organizers on the ground in Puerto Rico.She explains shelters there are either dealing with damage from the recent earthquakes or overcrowding because owners are surrendering their pets. “You are trying to, you know, do what is best for your family and make essentially life and death decisions. And sadly, your dog or your cat might not be part of that,” said Beckles.Since the 6.4 magnitude quake struck two weeks ago, President Trump has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico.“There are thousands of people that, tonight, are sleeping outside, on cots, in their cars, in tents. Because they are frightened to be in their own homes, or their homes have suffered catastrophic damage,” said Beckles. Beckles says she has no plans to stop saving the animals from shelters there.Another group of shelter dogs and cats are expected be flown in from Puerto Rico next month.

36,Puerto Rico fires two more officials after Hurricane Maria aid found unused amid current earthquake aftermath,Danielle Wallace   ,2020-01-20,"The pallets of bedding, food and medical supplies sat wrapped in plastic and unused in a warehouse for more than two years while Puerto Ricans suffered through the aftermath of a devastating hurricane and, recently, an earthquake. Now their discovery has triggered a political firestorm. On Sunday, Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez fired two more officials in the most recent development since anger broke out over a viral video showing unused emergency supplies  allegedly left-over aid from Hurricane Maria  sitting in a warehouse in the southern coastal city of Ponce.“There are thousands of people who made sacrifices to bring aid to the south and it’s unforgivable that resources have been kept in a warehouse,” the governor’s initial statement said.In Ponce,  thousands remain in shelters since a 6.4 magnitude quake struck the island two weeks ago.Housing Secretary Fernando Gil and Department of Family Secretary Glorimar Andújar were dismissed Sunday. The previous day, Gov. Vázquez had fired Carlos Acevedo, director of Puerto Rico’s Office of Emergency Management, hours after a Facebook video showed residents breaking into the warehouse to distribute supplies.The video, posted live by blogger Lorenzo Delgado, shows a warehouse filled with water bottles, cots, baby food and other basic supplies that had apparently been sitting there since Hurricane Maria battered the U.S. territory in September 2017.  A group of people is then seen breaking in and distributing the supplies.The firings come amid concerns over Puerto Rico’s credibility in Washington. The U.S. had temporarily retained some federal funds for Maria relief amid concerns of corruption and mismanagement. Last week, the Trump administration lifted on monthlong hold on $8.2 billion in congressionally approved disaster aid funding to help with earthquake relief efforts, Politico reported. On Thursday, President Trump declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico, allocating federal funding for repairs, temporary housing and low-cost loans ""to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,"" the White House said.Vázquez has ordered an investigation into the discovery of the supplies. In a press conference Sunday, she said no citizens will be prosecuted for breaking into the warehouse in order to obtain the relief.  She added that she chose to also fire Gil and Andújar after officials were unable to provide further information she requested about other collection and distribution centers in meetings with leaders of her administration that morning. Acevedo meanwhile has denied he mishandled the emergency supplies, saying in a statement that about 600 pallets of water were distributed when Hurricane Dorian, Hurricane Karen and drought all affected the island last year. He added that the warehouse supplies were expired and no one had ordered for them to be removed or destroyed..Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

55,Puerto Rico protesters call for governor to resign after mob finds relief supplies,Jorge Fitz-Gibbon,2020-01-20,"Protesters in Puerto Rico called for Gov. Wanda Vazquez to resign Monday — blaming her for squandered emergency supplies found locked up in a warehouse over the weekend. Dozens in the earthquake-rattled island gathered outside La Fortaleza, the governor’s mansion, banging on frying pans and holding signs with messages like “Government, Absent, Criminal, Negligent.” “I have never come out to protest but this caused me so much anger and indignation,” protester Rubi Oliveras told El Vocero newspaper. “How is it possible that you say you care about the country and yet you let so many people die while hiding these supplies?” The protest intensified throughout the day, with the angry mob marching to the steps of the island’s capitol building in San Juan. At 4 p.m. Vazquez called back three squadrons of “shock force” police that had been dispatched to the scene in order to keep the demonstration from getting out of control, El Nuevo Diario reported. “I respect the constitutional right of citizens to demonstrate and I trust that my Puerto Rican brothers will do so in order,” the governor wrote on Twitter. “There is no need for the use of the shock force at this time, so I have requested that regular security be withdrawn and maintained.” News of the unused emergency supplies spread on social media Saturday when a local blogger posted a video of the facility, which housed water, cots and other relief supplies dating back to Hurricane Maria in 2017. Ponce Mayor Maria Melendez said she was outraged by the discovery. “I spent several days requesting cots and water,” said Melendez. “They sent me to Cabo Rojo for the cots and to San Juan for the water. If I had known that those supplies were there I would have demanded that they be taken out immediately.” Vazquez claimed she was also in the dark about the stash of supplies and fired three top government officials over the weekend — the director of emergency management and the commissioners of the housing and family departments. The newspaper El Nuevo Dia reported that a second warehouse in Guaynabo is also stocked with supplies that have not been tapped. Last week’s 6.4-magnitude earthquake killed at least one person and caused an estimated $200 million in damage, sending more than 7,000 people to emergency shelters. The island is also still not fully recovered from Maria, a Category 5 hurricane that hit the island in September 2017, killing more than 3,000 people and leaving much of the island in ruins.

56,Trump ending hold of $8B in Puerto Rico disaster aid relief,Yaron Steinbuch,2020-01-15,"The Trump administration is ending its months-long hold of more than $8 billion in disaster aid relief for Puerto Rico, according to a report. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will allow the US territory to access the $8.2 billion once the agency publishes a Federal Register notice on how it plans to distribute the funds, according to Politico. HUD has been authorized to administer nearly $20 billion to the island’s hurricane relief efforts through its Community Development Block Grant. The money is intended to help Puerto Rico respond to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which devastated the island in 2017. So far, it has only received $1.5 billion, Politico reported. In September, HUD blew the deadline to publish the funding notice, saying it had to ensure that financial safeguards were put in place amid the recent political unrest on the island. “Now that a full financial monitoring team is assembled and active, we can move forward with confidence that these disaster recovery funds will reach those who need them the most,” a HUD official told Politico. Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jennifer Gonzalez said in a statement to the news outlet that the money is needed “now more than ever after the earthquakes.” “It’s the best news in months,” she said, adding that she had discussed the matter with President Trump. Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on the administration to “cease and desist that illegal activity,” referring to the hold on the funds.

57,Cuomo accompanies National Guardsmen to Puerto Rico after quakes,Bernadette Hogan,2020-01-14,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo flew to Puerto Rico Tuesday with 115 members of the National Guard, blankets, pillows and emergency kits, hoping to help the island hit hard by earthquakes over in recent weeks. “Puerto Rico is still hurting from the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria and the federal government’s protracted recovery over two years ago,” he said. “Now the island is once again being dealt a devastating blow with a series of earthquakes and tremors that have caused widespread damage and power outages, leaving thousands of families in shelters.” Cuomo traveled with state Budget Director Robert Mujica, Gil Quiniones, the president of the New York Power Authority — the state’s electric utility — state and city officials, and representatives from nonprofits like the Red Cross. His daughter Michaela also joined, who will be paying for the trip out of pocket. The delegation toured the Costa Sur Power Plant and areas heavily hit by the series of earthquakes in Guánica and Ponce — on the opposite side of the US territory’s capital city, San Juan.

59,"Hit by new natural disasters, Puerto Rico’s woes deepened by corruption",Post Editorial Board,2020-01-13,"Nearly 950 earthquakes and aftershocks have hit Puerto Rico since Dec. 31, leaving 2,000 people in shelters, nearly a million without power until Monday and hundreds of thousands without water. The damage runs at least $110 million, yet relief efforts are slowed by the island’s endemic corruption. The worst quake, a magnitude 6.4, hit last Tuesday and killed at least one person. Another, at 5.9, hit Saturday morning. Gov. Wanda Vazquez has declared a major state emergency and announced $2 million in help for hard-hit towns. All this, when repairs still aren’t finished nearly two years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit in 2017. And Puerto Rico is still waiting on billions in federal funds from the $91 billion promised then. President Trump is withholding some cash because of serious “financial mismanagement.” Notably, the FBI is investigating multiple officials and contractors for misusing hurricane relief. Evidence of that abuse keeps popping up: At least 10 trailers full of food, water and baby supplies were found in the parking lot of an elections office last year. Thousands of now-unsafe bottles of water sit on farmland in Dorado, just outside of San Juan. On top of help rebuilding, Puerto Rico desperately needs assistance in building an honest, competent governing class.

58,Cuomo to travel to Puerto Rico after series of earthquakes,Bernadette Hogan,2020-01-13,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that he will fly to Puerto Rico to assist recovery efforts following several massive earthquakes that have struck the U.S. territory recently. “Puerto Rico had not just one two or three earthquakes, they still had tremors as of last night. Twenty tremors in the past 24 hours,” the Democratic governor said at an unrelated press conference in Rockland County. “They have thousands of people in shelters in Puerto Rico. And Puerto Rico, remember, is still hurting from Hurricane Maria where I believe this federal government really did not do what they needed to do to help, and left them on their own.” Cuomo will travel with a delegation Tuesday including Division of the Budget Director Robert Mujica as well as some state officials. He will return to New York on Wednesday, according to his office. “The point of the visit is basically to assess the damage and determine how we can best help…Can we help with engineering, can we help with the power plant, can we help with supplies? What do they need that we can best provide,” he added. Last week, the New York Power Authority deployed employees to help with recovery work amidst a series of blackouts that have plagued the island. Quakes have hit the island on and off since Dec. 28, displacing residents and forcing them to sleep in shelters, or on the streets. President Trump placed the US territory under a state of emergency last week. Cuomo has been a supporter of the island, especially following the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The governor spent Thanksgiving on the island with his three daughters, Michaela, Cara and Mariah in November. Several weeks prior, he attended the Somos Puerto Rican Conference in San Juan, an annual event attended by legislators and political insiders.

60,Earthquake rocks Puerto Rico — days after latest quake,Eileen AJ Connelly,2020-01-11,"A 5.9 magnitude earthquake shook Puerto Rico early Saturday, days after the island lost power following an earlier, even larger quake. US Geological Survey records show a 5.9 quake at 8:54 a.m. Saturday local time off the coast of Guanica, about 90 miles southeast of San Juan. It was the 12th quake of the day for the island, United States Geological Survey records show, and the second most powerful quake among a continuous series that has shaken the island in the past month. The shake was felt throughout the island, David Begnaud of CBS News tweeted. He said he was in the 10th story of a hotel in San Juan and “the room shook for more than 15 seconds. That was the strongest earthquake I’ve felt since arriving on the island Tuesday.” “I’m not sure folks understand what’s happening in Puerto Rico,” tweeted Yarimar Bonilla, a professor at Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center who is in San Juan. “It’s not 1, 2, or even 3 quakes. It’s THOUSANDS. It’s constant fear. Its collapsing bridges. It’s not just about lack of electricity — it’s about fear, anxiety, and uncertainty haunting already debilitated communities.” Residents keep getting told that the continuous quakes are “just aftershocks,” Bonilla said, but even smaller quakes are damaging homes. A landslide caused by a 4.8 shaker overnight also damaged homes, but there was no one in them, Begnaud reported. Thousands of people are living in shelters, while others are simply sleeping on the sidewalks following the devastating quakes, the Associated Press reported. Many can’t or won’t return home because their walls are cracked, their houses have collapsed or they’ve been indefinitely evacuated. Hundreds of thousands across the island have no electricity and at least one person died and nine were injured in the 6.4-magnitude quake that hit on Tuesday.

Police said they’re investigating whether the deadly episode was tied to an attempted murder Monday against another one of the children’s sons, Luis Ramos Wickline, 22, who has since been arrested on a carjacking warrant, Univision reported. “It’s too early to establish a motive,” Detective Carlos Nazario told reporters. “We are looking at all angles.” The scene of the shooting is located about 10 miles south of the US territory’s capital city of San Juan.

64,Louisiana couple killed in New Year’s Eve boat fire in Puerto Rico,Jackie Salo,2020-01-01,"A Louisiana couple died in Puerto Rico when the catamaran they were aboard erupted in flames on New Year’s Eve, officials said. Gather Tannehill and wife, Ginna, were on the 42-foot Miss Adventure Lagoon anchored in the marina of Puerto Real in Cabo Rojo when the blaze broke out Tuesday evening in the kitchen area, according to Puerto Rican news outlet El Vocero. There was a 911 call placed around 6:45 p.m., officials said. The couple — believed to be in their late 60s — was dead when authorities arrived on the scene, outlet Noti Uno reported. Gather was killed in the inferno while his wife died from smoke inhalation. Police said an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the fire. The pair’s friend, Dario Vissepo, said they sailed to Cabo Rojo on previous occasions, but had returned last week to make Puerto Rico “their home for good.” “Gina & Gate were blessed with being such wonderful warmhearted human beings, always with a smile and super friendly,” Vissepo wrote on Facebook. “We shared countless joyful times of camaraderie in our beer garden, marina and onboard.” ",https://nypost.com/2020/01/01/louisiana-couple-killed-in-new-years-eve-boat-fire-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
65,New York couple killed during flash flood in Puerto Rico,Joshua Rhett Miller,2019-10-25,"Two college sweethearts who recently moved to New York were killed in a flash flood during a weekend getaway to Puerto Rico, relatives said. Maya Robinson, a portfolio analyst at BlackRock, and her boyfriend, Mark Keffer, an analyst at software firm ION Group, died Oct. 11 during a guided rainforest tour to celebrate four years of dating, Robinson’s mother told the Boston Globe. “They were caught in a flash flood almost as soon as they got there, it appears,” Duana Hamilton told the newspaper. Robinson and Keffer were both 22 and met during freshman orientation at Georgetown University, where they quickly became an inseparable item, according to Keffer’s obituary. “He became enthralled with her from the moment they met, only a few weeks into their freshman year,” the obit reads. “They did almost everything together from that point on … They were ambitious, always talking about what their futures might look like.” The couple also performed together in the Capitol Gs, a singing troupe at Georgetown where Keffer was known as “Posh Spice,” while Robinson, a New Hampshire native, played the “Good Cop” of the bunch, a motherly figure who watched over the a cappella group. “We are heartbroken to announce the loss of our two beloved members,” the troupe posted last week on Facebook. “Their energy and voices will be missed.” Robinson’s mother told the Globe she “just collapsed” when she learned about the flood that killed the couple in the 29,000-acre El Yunque National Forest. “I feel that we lost an angel,” Hamilton said. “They were both very, very nice, kind people.” Robinson had been living and working in Manhattan for just three months, Hamilton said. Keffer, a Texas native who later moved to London, was living in Brooklyn at the time, near his brother and college roommate, according to his obituary. “Mark loved his first grown-up home, which he decorated by trawling nearby thrift stores with his interior designer mother, Debbie,” the obit continued. A friend of Robinson’s family, meanwhile, told the Globe she had an innate ability to “relate to a lot of different people” and was occasionally teased about when she planned to take a vacation from her busy life. “She was on her way to do great things and I feel terrible that her life was stolen from her like this,” Anne Stevenson said. “We want to know why and how this could happen.” Keffer’s funeral was held Monday in Houston. Memorial services for Robinson will be held Sunday in Detroit and on Nov. 9 at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where she graduated in 2015.

66,6.0-magnitude earthquake shakes Puerto Rico,Associated Press,2019-09-24,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck near Puerto Rico late Monday, rousing and scaring many from their sleep in the US territory. The US Geological Survey said the quake struck 49 miles off the island’s northwest coast at a shallow depth of 6 miles (10 kilometers). Three aftershocks, of magnitude 4.7 and 4.6, hit within less than an hour in the same region at the same depth. Kiara Hernández, spokeswoman for the island’s Emergency Management Agency, told the Associated Press that there were no immediate reports of damage and that there was no risk of tsunami. She said emergency management officials were already on alert for the approaching Tropical Depression Karen and communicated quickly with mayors and others across the island to check on any damage. The National Guard also had been activated for the storm, and schools and government offices remained closed as heavy rains were forecast for Puerto Rico on Tuesday, with warnings of possible flooding and landslides. Hernández said crews would be inspecting buildings to ensure their safety. “We will know this information little by little,” she said. The quake was felt across Puerto Rico and was the strongest to hit the island in recent years. While Puerto Rico experiences very small earthquakes on a daily basis that no one feels, seismologists have said it’s rare for bigger ones to strike the island. Yahaida Zabala, a 46-year-old San Juan resident, was asleep when she felt her building sway around 11:23 p.m. Monday. “I rushed into my son’s room,” she said. “He was sitting like he was paralyzed.” They ran down the stairs of their building and stood outside with a small group of people awaiting aftershocks. The last strong quake to shake the island in recent years occurred in January 2014, when a magnitude-6.4 tremor struck after midnight just north of the island’s north coast at a depth of 17 miles (28 kilometers). Authorities reported broken windows, a busted water line and cracked floors and walls, along with some power outages. Some 70 aftershocks were reported afterward, with at least three of magnitude 3.5 or greater. The most damaging earthquake to hit Puerto Rico in recent history occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude-7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, causing a tsunami and killing 116 people.

67,Dorian now a hurricane as it bears down on Puerto Rico,Jorge Fitz-Gibbon,2019-08-28,"Dorian has been upgraded to a hurricane as the churning storm prepares to strike Puerto Rico on Wednesday — with 75-mph winds and heavy rains that could cause up to $15 billion in new damage there. It was upgraded from a tropical storm after picking up steam overnight and shifting course to put it on a more direct collision course with the US territory — and could be headed for the Florida coast this weekend as a Category 3 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said. A hurricane warning remained in effect in Puerto Rico as the area braces for impact, with more than 300 emergency shelters opened throughout the island, Gov. Wanda Vazquez said in a televised broadcast. “We are better prepared than when Hurricane Maria attacked our island,” Vazquez said. Maria slammed Puerto Rico in 2017, leaving 3,000 dead and inflicting $90 billion in damages. AccuWeather estimated that Dorian could cause up to $15 billion in new damage to the island based on the increased winds and heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding on the island. “The estimate includes damage to homes and businesses, their contents and cars, as well as job and wage losses, infrastructure damage, costs to the travel and tourism industry, and auxiliary business losses,” AccuWeather said in an advisory. Hurricane warnings remain in effect for the US and British Virgin Islands. The storm is expected to hit Hispaniola by early Thursday.

68,Tropical Storm Dorian gains strength on path to Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2019-08-28,"Puerto Rico was bracing early Wednesday for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian, which is expected to become a hurricane before threatening the Bahamas and the US, according to forecasters. Dorian was packing sustained winds of 60 mph as of 5 a.m. as it churned northwest at 13 mph on its path toward Puerto Rico and then the British Virgin Islands, the National Hurricane Center said. Tropical storm conditions are expected in parts of the Dominican Republic late Wednesday and Thursday, with rainfall of up to 10 inches possible in some areas. The storm’s exact path remains very difficult to predict, but forecasters say almost all their models suggest Florida residents should keep close watch as the system approaches the US coast this weekend. A change in Dorian’s course concerned many across Puerto Rico, where about 30,000 homes still have blue tarps as roofs nearly two years after Hurricane Maria. The US territory’s 3.2 million inhabitants still depend on a shaky power grid that has remained susceptible to outages since it was destroyed by the deadly Category 4 storm, which killed almost 3,000 people. The White House — which was assailed over its response to the 2017 hurricane — said President Trump approved an emergency declaration late Tuesday for Puerto Rico, allowing for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide assistance in coordination with ongoing disaster preparedness efforts. “We are better prepared than when Hurricane Maria attacked our island,” Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez said during a televised news conference. Vazquez, who took office recently after political turmoil led to the resignation of her predecessor, said preparations for the storm were more than 90 percent complete, emergency shelters have been opened and schools have been closed.

69,"Dorian largely spares Puerto Rico, takes aim at Florida",Jorge Fitz-Gibbon,2019-08-28,"Hurricane Dorian was barreling toward the US coastline Wednesday night and could strengthen into a Category 3 storm by the time it hits the mainland as early as this weekend, forecasters said. Puerto Rico was largely spared Dorian’s worst, with the squall changing course and just grazing the eastern edge of the island before heading into open water. But that could spell trouble for Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Wednesday. “All Floridians on the East Coast should have 7 days of supplies, prepare their homes & follow the track closely,” DeSantis said on Twitter. County governments along the Sunshine State’s east-central coast began distributing sandbags, while residents flocked to warehouse retailers for canned food, water and supplies. Dorian strengthened Wednesday from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane — meaning winds between 74 and 95 mph — and will have little in its path to slow it down now as it churns over the warm waters of the Atlantic basin at 14 mph, according to experts. “The Virgin Islands is the only thing it’s really interacting with and that’s not going to be a big deal,” AccuWeather meteorologist Jake Sojda told The Post. “Right now it’s looking like it’s going to stay over open water pretty much for its whole entire life before making landfall, and now the expectation is that this is going to become a major hurricane,” he added. Forecasters say the storm will reach Category 3 — meaning gales of up to 129 mph — before it hits the US coast, according to AccuWeather. Despite not hitting Puerto Rico head-on, Dorian still brought high winds and heavy downpours to the island, with up to eight inches of rainfall in portions of the east side of the US territory. Puerto Ricans — who have not fully recovered from 2017’s Hurricane Maria, which killed nearly 3,000 people and inflicted more than $90 billion worth of damage — had prepped for the worst. “Heavy rainfall over portions of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could produce flash flooding through Thursday morning,” the National Hurricane Center said. Authorities reported one storm-related fatality in the US territory, where an 80-year-old man fell to his death from his roof while trying to storm-proof his home Wednesday. Dorian also entirely missed the larger island of Hispaniola. Forecasters said earlier in the week that some of Dorian’s strength would have been sapped had it gone over the island, which is home to the Dominican Republican and Haiti. But a tropical storm warning that had been in effect was lifted early Wednesday when the storm shifted north and toward the US.

42,Puerto Rico justice secretary sworn in as governor after Supreme Court overturns inauguration of predecessor,Ronn Blitzer   ,2019-08-07,"Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez was sworn in as the island's new governor Wednesday, hours after its Supreme Court ruled that Friday's inauguration of Pedro Pierluisi as governor was against the law and overturned it.The unpopular Vázquez had said last month she didn't want the job amid weeks of political turmoil that saw thousands of protestors demand the resignation of former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. She will be the island territory's second female governor.Her appointment is expected to draw more demonstrations, as the hashtag #WandaRenuncia, or ""Wanda resign,"" was trending on social media even before Rosselló formally vacated his position.The hashtag is similar to ""#RickyRenuncia,"" which was used by activists to urge Rosselló to step down.Widespread opposition to Vázquez -- who was appointed in 2017 and is seen as being part of Rosselló's inner circle --partly stems from allegations she failed to pursue corruption probes against members of her pro-statehood New Progressive Party.Pierluisi was appointed secretary of state by Rosselló while legislators were in recess, and only the House approved his nomination. He was then sworn in as governor Friday after Rosselló formally resigned. In response, Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz sued to challenge Pierluisi's legitimacy as governor, arguing the Senate's approval was also necessary.""It is concluded that the swearing-in as governor by Hon. Pedro R. Pierluisi Urrutia, named secretary of state in recess, is unconstitutional,"" the court said in a statement.Rosselló's office said at the time that Pierluisi did not need to be confirmed by both chambers of Puerto Rico's legislature. Pierluisi supporters cited a 2005 law said that in cases where a secretary of state is taking over as governor, they do not have to be approved by both houses of the legislature.The Senate's lawsuit claimed that the law went against the island's constitution and the Supreme Court agreed.Pierluisi said before the ruling that he would respect the court's decision, no matter what it would be.""I wish the Honorable Wanda Vázquez Garced the greatest success as Governor of Puerto Rico. I will always be in the best disposition to advance any initiative that seeks to improve the quality of life of our people and to encourage the Federal Government to fulfill its responsibility to provide the support that Puerto Rico needs for its recovery and reconstruction,""Rosselló first announced on July 24 that he would resign after two weeks of protests over mismanagement and leaked chats that showed him and his top aides denigrating victims of Hurricane Maria and other Puerto Ricans.The scandal resulted in the resignation of top Puerto Rican officials, including then-Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin. According to Puerto Rico's line of succession, the secretary of state is next in line to serve as governor.When Marin resigned, Vázquez was next.Fox News’ Louis Casiano and .",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/puerto-rico-new-governor-wanda-vazquez-supreme-court-pedro-pierluisi,Fox,Conservative
71,"Puerto Rico court overturns Pedro Pierluisi as new governor, Wanda Vázquez sworn in",Mark Moore,2019-08-07,"Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the swearing-in of Pedro Pierluisi as governor was unconstitutional, paving the way for Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez to take over the post. Pierluisi took the oath of office last Friday when embattled Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned after it was revealed he shared derogatory text messages with his advisers. “The governor’s oath of office was unconstitutional,” the court said. “Therefore, Hon. Pedro R. Pierluisi Urrutia can’t continue his work as Governor after this Opinion and Sentence becomes effective.” The decision, which cannot be appealed, took effect at 5 p.m. The unanimous ruling cleared the way for Justice Secretary Vázquez to become the island’s next governor. Vázquez took the oath of office in the early evening at the Supreme Court before leaving without making any public comment. Although she said last month that she had “no interest” in the position, she changed course after the ruling and said she would accept it because “Puerto Rico needs assurance and stability.” “Our actions are aimed will be aimed toward that end and it will always come first,” Vázquez, who has been criticized for not prosecuting corruption in her and Rosselló’s political party, said in a statement. Pierluisi was appointed secretary of state by Rosselló – making him next in the line of succession – but only the House approved the nomination. The Senate then challenged Pierluisi’s legitimacy. “It’s unconstitutional to allow a Secretary of State to become Governor without having been confirmed by both legislative chambers,” the court said in a press release. Rosselló was forced from office after weeks of massive protests, stemming from the messages that insulted women, belittled homosexuals and mocked victims of Hurricane Maria.

72,"Online lenders under investigation by regulators in 11 states, Puerto Rico",Kevin Dugan,2019-08-06,"The New York Department of Financial Services is leading a multistate probe that could snag a Silicon Valley startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz and the rapper Nas, The Post has learned. The probe, backed by 10 other state banking regulators and Puerto Rico, will focus on a new crop of online lender that charges people potentially usurious rates for cash in advance of their paychecks, regulators said in a press release Tuesday. And one of the companies they’re looking at is Earnin, a Silicon Valley darling valued near $1 billion that recently attracted financial support from Nas, the Queensbridge, NY, rapper behind “N.Y. State of Mind,” a source with knowledge of the probe told The Post. “Earnin is a community that is creating a fairer financial system that supports one another,” Nas said in announcing his “support and investment” in the company in June. The rapper, whose real name is Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, did not return a request for comment on the probe. “High-cost payroll loans are scrutinized closely in New York, and this investigation will help determine whether these payroll advance practices are usurious and harming consumers,” said Linda Lacewell, the New York Department of Financial Services’ Superintendent. Regulators for Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas have also joined the probe. Document requests have been sent to Earnin and 10 other companies, a source said. The move grows out of an earlier DFS probe into Earnin following a March report in The Post about how the company appears to skirt lending laws by labeling interest as tips, which are optional but strongly encouraged. These “tips” can result in annual percentage rates of over 400 percent for a single cash advance. “This is a brand new model, so we expect, and welcome questions from regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services,” according to a statement from the company. The company has been gearing to battle regulatory and press scrutiny for months, including hiring the former DFS chief, according to former employees and a trove of internal communications obtained by The Post. In April, Earnin CEO Ram Palaniappan hired Ben Lawsky, the former DFS superintendent who now runs a regulatory consulting group, to help the company respond to the agency, according to documents and a former employee. Palaniappan met with Lawsky on the night of July 8, before the company sent a package of information to the DFS for its stand-alone investigation, according to a person briefed on it. Palaniappan has also met with Jim Messina, the former campaign manager for President Obama’s re-election campaign who now runs his own strategic communications firm, internal documents show. A source with direct knowledge of the talks said the meeting was to discuss Messina’s help with upcoming regulations. Earnin is not a Messina Group client, a spokesman said. Palaniappan sought help from within Silicon Valley, as well. On April 17, an investor at tech hedge fund Coatue Management introduced Palaniappan with Emil Michael, the former chief business officer of Uber who was ousted from the company after suggesting they should dig up dirt on critical journalists, and who was accused of suppressing records of a rape victim in India, documents show. Michael was later dropped as a defendant in the suit after arguing he wasn’t involved with the records. “Building something new often requires being thoughtful about how to manage regulatory and I figured you would be one of the most experienced people at figuring this type of problem out. Any advice you can give him would be greatly appreciated!” Rahul Kishore, the Coatue manager, wrote in the introductory email. The two have talked at least once, on May 21, for about a half hour, according to internal records. Michael recommended that he speak with another regulatory executive from Uber during the call, according to another person familiar with the call. Representatives for Lawsky, Michael, and Coatue weren’t immediately available for comment.

73,Puerto Rico legislators grill potential new governor Pedro Pierluisi over conflicts of interest,Bob Fredericks,2019-08-02,"Puerto Rico’s potential next governor defended himself Friday against conflict of interest concerns that threatened to derail his confirmation and leave the island in political turmoil after disgraced Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s expected 5 p.m. departure. Former congressional representative Pedro Pierluisi sat alone as he faced more than two dozen legislators in the first of two public hearings held to debate his selection as secretary of state. When Rosselló leaves office, the secretary of state would become governor. Lawmakers, and Pierluisi himself, worry that the continuing political uncertainly would damage Puerto Rico’s efforts to get federal funds to recover from 2017’s devastating Hurricane Maria and to deal with the US territory’s worsening economic crisis. But several legislators have accused Pierluisi of a conflict of interest because he worked for a law firm that represents a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances, a body that has repeatedly clashed with local officials over demands for austerity measures. Pierluisi, whose brother-in-law is the board’s chairman, tried to dispel those concerns in his opening remarks. “Who better than me to advocate for our people before the board? Who better than me to facilitate the process that will force the board to leave? That is what we all want,” he said. The board was created by Congress to oversee the restructuring of more than $70 billion in public debt after Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy. Pierluisi told lawmakers he is against several austerity measures demanded by the board, including layoffs of public employees and eliminating a Christmas bonus. He said he supports public-private partnerships and the privatization of the island’s public power company. “The people want a change, and I don’t blame them,” he said. If he is rejected, Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez automatically becomes governor as the next in the order of succession. She said she would reluctantly accept the job. Some lawmakers said a House vote for Pierluisi would count as confirmation and allow him to assume the governorship. Opponents said he requires Senate approval, too, and they would sue to stop him becoming governor without that. Pierluisi was Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative in Congress from 2009 to 2017 and then ran against Rosselló in the 2016 primaries and lost. Political infighting and paralysis has followed a wave of street protests against Rosselló, who joins more than a dozen government officials who have resigned in the wake of an obscenity-laced chat in which they made fun of women, gay people and hurricane victims.

74,"Puerto Rico’s disgraced Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigns, will swear in replacement",Bob Fredericks,2019-08-02,"Scandal-scarred Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned as promised Friday afternoon and said he would swear in veteran politician Pedro Pierluisi as his replacement. Thousands of Puerto Ricans cheered in front of the governor’s mansion when Rosselló’s resignation became official. In an e-mailed announcement from his office, Rosselló said Pierluisi does not need confirmation from both houses of the US territory’s legislature because he was named secretary of state, the next in line to be governor, in a recess appointment this week. The statement says Pierluisi will be sworn in to complete Rosselló’s term but did not say exactly when. Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives had earlier voted to confirm Pierluisi as secretary of state. The House, which is controlled by Pierluisi’s New Progressive Party, voted 26-21 to confirm Rosselló’s handpicked nominee. The House erupted into cheers when the deciding vote was cast. But Pierluisi’s fate remains ­unclear. While the secretary of state is next to line for the governor’s chair when the chief executive resigns, the issue of who is rightfully governor was almost certain to go to court. Some politicians believe that because the legislature wasn’t in session when Pierluisi was appointed, he’s already secretary of state unless the legislature rejects him. Others argue that he still needs to be confirmed — some say just by the House of Representatives. Still others say the Senate has to approve him, too. If Pierluisi does not become governor, the position is taken by Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez, who is not widely popular and already was the target of protests. Rosselló promised to quit after weeks of protest over mismanagement and corruption in his administration and a series of leaked chats in which he and advisers denigrate a range of Puerto Ricans, including former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. He is the first elected governor of Puerto Rico to resign. Pierluisi vowed to serve the people. “My history of public service to our people should be sufficient proof of where my loyalties are and how I will work for our people,” said Pierluisi, who is both Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress and justice secretary.

43,"Puerto Rico power vacuum: As embattled Gov. Rosello steps down, no one knows who will lead the island",Phil Keating   ,2019-08-02,"Who will be Puerto Rico’s governor at 5 p.m. Friday? With just hours to go, no one seems to know for sure, which could create a constitutional crisis in the U.S. commonwealth.Current Gov. Ricardo ""Ricky"" Rossello caved after 12 days of demonstrations last month, agreeing to resign at 5 p.m. today. Rossello’ was caught up in a texting scandal on the island, involving him and 11 of his allies, all men, making crude, sexist, homophobic comments about people and also making fun of Hurricane Maria victims. The nightly protests ended up evolving to include allegations of government corruption and misuse of tens of millions of dollars-worth of hurricane disaster relief funds.According to Puerto Rico’s Constitution, if the governor resigns or dies in office, the line of succession automatically goes to the secretary of state. But Puerto Rico has no secretary of state right now, because he resigned already. On Wednesday, Rossello nominated Puerto Rico’s former non-voting representative to the U.S. Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, to become the next secretary of state, and thus the governor when Rossello’ resigns, but it appears both chambers of Puerto Rico’s legislature will not confirm him in time, if at all.Puerto Rico’s House is meeting on Friday and could confirm Pierluisi by 5 p.m. But the Senate also has to confirm the nominee, and the Senate president, Thomas Rivera Schatz, on Thursday, delayed a vote until at least Monday, while also indicating there weren’t enough votes to confirm Pierluisi at this point.If there is no secretary of state when Rossello resigns, next in line to become governor would be Secretary of Justice Wanda Vaszuez. She said Sunday that she didn’t want the job. However, she has since indicated that she would be willing to become governor. So by today, perhaps, she could become the next governor. Perhaps.The next in line is Secretary of Finance Francisco Peres. But at 31, he’s too young. The Constitution requires the governor to be 35.And then there are the other theories bouncing around the island, such as Rossello backing off his promise to leave office at 5 p.m. and remain governor. Or that the House on Friday does confirm Pierluisi and he attempts to assume control, without the Senate weighing in. That would then trigger a weekend of chaos and confusion, as lawmakers take it to the courts.Bottom line: uncertainty reigns supreme on the island of 3.2 million U.S. citizens.Phil Keating joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 2004 and currently serves as FNC's Miami-based correspondent.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/as-puerto-rico-gov-ricardo-rosello-prepares-to-step-down-no-one-knows-who-will-lead-island,Fox,Conservative
44,"Rosselló officially resigns as Puerto Rico governor, Pedro Pierluisi sworn in as replacement",Louis Casiano   ,2019-08-02,"Outgoing Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló made his resignation official Friday, clearing the way for veteran politician Pedro Pierluisi to become the island territory's new chief executive, at least temporarily.In an emailed statement, Rosselló's office said Pierluisi, 60, did not need to be confirmed by both chambers of Puerto Rico's legislature because he had been named secretary of state, the next in line to be governor, in a recess appointment earlier this week.Pierluisi was sworn in by a judge at 5 p.m., the hour Rossello had set to leave office. Two hours after taking the oath, Pierluisi emerged at the governor's residence to address the press and said he would only promise to serve as governor until Wednesday when the Senate has called a hearing on his nomination. If the Senate votes no, Pierluisi said, he will step down and hand the governorship to the justice secretary, the next in line under the constitution.Rosselló announced July 24 that he would resign after two weeks of protests over mismanagement and leaked chats that showed him and his top aides denigrating victims of Hurricane Maria and other Puerto Ricans.Pierluisi was confirmed as the secretary of state Friday by a 26-21 vote, with one abstention, in the island's House of Representatives. He was nominated by Rosselló. Both are members of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party.The issue over who is rightfully governor will almost certainly go to court. Some believe that because the legislature wasn't in session when Pierluisi was appointed, he is the secretary of state unless the legislature rejects him.Others say he still needs to be confirmed by the island's Senate. Adding to the confusion, one constitutional amendment states that everyone in line to become governor has to be confirmed by both the House and Senate, except for the secretary of state.Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, a member of Rosselló's party, said the outgoing governor ""did not respect the demands of the people"" and has vowed to vote against any nominee put forward by him. Rivera Schatz is seen as a possible candidate for governor in next year's scheduled election. Several legislators have said they prefer Rivera Schatz over Pierluisi, but the Senate leader is a powerful figure deeply associated with Puerto Rico's political and business elite, and his elevation to the governorship could re-ignite popular outrage.
If Pierluisi doesn't become governor, Justice Secretary Wanda Vazquez would have been next in line. An ally of Rosselló who is widely unpopular and the target of protests herself, she said last month she doesn't want the job.Several lawmakers have accused Pierluisi of having a conflict of interest because he worked for a law firm representing the federal control board that oversees the island's finances. Many have called for the board to be abolished amid crippling austerity measures. Pierluisi's brother in law is the board's president.“Who better than me to advocate for our people before the board?"" Pierluisi said recently in opening remarks at a House hearing on his nomination. ""Who better than me to facilitate the process that will force the board to leave? That is what we all want.""The board was created by Congress to supervise the restructuring of more than $70 billion in debt after Puerto Rico declared bankruptcy. Pierluisi said he is against several austerity measures supported by the board, including laying off public employees and eliminating Christmas bonuses.""The people want a change, and I don't blame them,"" he said.Pierluisi formally served as the island's non-voting member in Congress from 2009 to 2017 and was defeated by Rossello in the 2016 primaries.

75,The women out to stop Puerto Rico from having its second-ever female governor,Elisha Maldonado,2019-07-31,"SAN JUAN — The popular suspicion, or at least the very popular hope, among Puerto Rican activists is that Wanda Vázquez will quit rather than becoming the island’s governor Friday — not least because local women’s rights activists hate the idea. The biggest problem for Vázquez is her ties to Gov. Ricardo “Ricky” Rosselló, who stepped down last week after the revelation of 900 pages of offensive messages. Not only is she a member of his New Progressive Party, Rosselló gave Vázquez her current position as justice secretary. She also faces allegations that she refused to investigate corruption charges against members of her own party, choosing rather to cover up for Rosselló and his clique. Puerto Rico’s Office of Government Ethics said it is probing her for possible ethical violations, and she has already faced criminal charges over ethics concerns, though a judge deemed the evidence insufficient. For a woman who could be the island’s second-ever female governor, however, Vázquez also faces fierce opposition from women’s rights activists. What gives? Before she was secretary of justice, Vázquez spent seven years as the director of Puerto Rico’s women’s affairs office, which promotes gender equality and works to prevent domestic violence, discrimination against women and sexual assault, among other priorities. The women activists, however, see her tenure in that role and her subsequent career as emblematic of the island’s corrupt and indifferent political class, which is why the prospect of Vázquez in the governor’s fortress repels them. The latest political crisis has had a particular poignancy for women. The chats between Rosselló and members of his cabinet included sexist comments and the denigration of female politicians. And the island has also seen a disturbing recent uptick in violence against women, especially since Hurricane Maria struck. The Rosselló government’s response has been lacking, Puerto Rican feminists say. But the complaints of Puerto Rican women are not your regular old identity politics. Puerto Ricans are fed up with widespread corruption and dysfunction, which touches women’s lives as much as it does men’s. Many Puerto Ricans think their leaders have spent their time in office advancing their own interests instead of serving citizens. The government has thus failed to perform its most basic functions: enforcing justice and keeping its citizens, including women, safe from violent crime. Puerto Ricans are now holding Vázquez responsible for these derelictions of duty. Among those who gathered outside the Department of Justice building Monday to demand Vázquez’s resignation — the numbers were smaller than last week’s uprising — were a cluster of women who called themselves Mujeres en Resistencia, or “Women in Resistance.” The women sat side by side, holding hands, their mouths shut by duct tape. Others banged pots and pans, played music and waved flags. These women remember Vázquez’s failures and missteps, not least how she skipped out three years before the end of her 10-year term so she could assume an even more powerful role at Rosselló’s Department of Justice, a post equivalent to that of state attorney general. During Vázquez’s tenure at Justice, violent crime against women rose. In 2018, 51 women were murdered in Puerto Rico. According to the Women’s Affairs Office, 23 of those women were killed by their partners. That’s an increase from 2017, when 33 women were murdered, with 11 of these stemming from domestic violence issues, PBS reported. Yet police reports indicate that roughly half of those murders have been investigated fully, much less prosecuted. In both of these previous political posts, Vázquez “has not been able to meet our needs, she didn’t do good,” says Sylvia Calzada, one of two older ladies I talked to at Monday’s #WandaRenuncia protests. “She betrayed the women’s movement, she never did enough, only helping corruption.” Vázquez’s record indicates “she doesn’t care about women or people or justice,” says Mariliana Martinez, a 22-year-old teacher. “It’s not OK to be a person like that and not care and still have so much power.” “She’s an unconditional — she will always vote for the party,” adds Mariana Nogales, a lawyer who focuses on free speech and First Amendment cases. Vázquez “has no independence,” and so she’s “been on women’s blacklist for a long time.” Indeed, well before the recent wave of protests, women’s rights advocates have been leading demonstrations against the Rosselló government. In November 2018, the Colectiva Feminista en Construcción, a grassroots feminist group, organized a “sleepover” in front of La Fortaleza, the governor’s mansion in Old San Juan, to shed light on women’s issues and to demand a state of emergency declaration over gender violence. And so, feminist groups began to put together a “very organized” grassroots effort to put pressure on Vázquez and other members of government, Nogales tells me. Eventually, someone is going to have to take charge of the island. Whoever that is, he or she is bound to be politically weak and fearful of popular wrath. And perhaps that would be a good thing for a political class long accustomed to its corrupt privileges.

​Under Puerto Rico’s constitution, Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin would have succeeded Rosselló –​ ​but he resigned earlier this month after it was revealed he was among the top officials involved in the scandal that led to ​​​Rosselló​’s ouster.

Discover Puerto Rico, the island’s tourism agency, has tried to allay fears that vacations may be ruined by recent protests over Gov.

Mass protests have formed over the last two weeks after a series of offensive texts between Rosselló and other members of the administration were leaked to the press. In one of the messages, Rosselló referred to former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is from Puerto Rico, as a “whore.” “With the recent protests on the Island, calling for the Governor’s resignation, a resolution was needed for the Island to continue its strong path to recovery,” the tourism agency said. “We are encouraged by the accounts of many travelers who arrived on the Island during the last two weeks to enjoy the Island’s gastronomy, attractions and cultural offerings, and we are welcoming new travelers each day.” But local tourism has already taken a hit from the political unrest in the island destination.

Many Puerto Ricans are resentful over the resulting pension cuts, school closings and other austerity measures.The economic crisis is in part a result of previous administrations — including that of Rosselló's father, Pedro — that overspent, overestimated revenue and borrowed millions as the island sank deeper into debt. In 2017, Puerto Rico filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy. Congress approved a financial package, and a federal board is overseeing the island's finances.Rosselló spent much of his time as governor fighting austerity measures and seeking federal funds after Maria devastated the island in September 2017, causing thousands of deaths and more than $100 billion in damage.But nearly two years later, some 30,000 homes still have tarp roofs, power outages remain common, and Puerto Rico has received less than a third of the roughly $40 billion pledged by the U.S. government.

He asked for patience and on Wednesday evening said he was working on the announcement. Earlier on Wednesday, a source close to Rosselló said that the governor is set to step down in a ""quick exit,"" adding a video has already been cut and the wheels are in motion to move the island's government forward.""It's over. Transition well in gear,"" the source said. A second source corroborated the information.The governor's office, however, maintained Wednesday afternoon that he ""continues"" in office and has not left:“Governor Ricardo Rosselló Nevares has not resigned and continues in Puerto Rico. As he said yesterday, he is in a process of reflection and listening to the people. Whatever decision you make, it will be officially communicated, as usual. Due to the environment of expectation, at the moment, there are incorrect rumors that are being disseminated, even in some media. We reiterate that any official communication will be shared with the media.”Public outcry against Rosselló reached a fever pitch earlier this month, after Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published approximately 900 pages of private messages between him and other officials that included misogynistic and homophobic language.In one message Rosselló called one New York female politician of Puerto Rican descent a “w---e” and described another as a “daughter of a b---h.” One chat also made vulgar references to Latin pop star Ricky Martin’s homosexuality. The messages also included jokes about Puerto Rican victims of Hurrican Maria, which devastated the island in 2017.Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice confirmed to Fox News that search warrants were issued as officials in the U.S. territory look into whether any criminal or ethical crimes were committed in the so-called “chatgate” controversy.The messages went public after two former Puerto Rico officials were arrested on corruption charges. Prosecutors say former Puerto Rico Education Secretary Julia Keleher and former Health Insurance Administration head Ángela Ávila-Marrero were involved in illegally helping friends get lucrative government contracts. Rosselló himself was not indicted.Thousands of protesters demonstrated outside Rosselló’s home earlier in the week. Other protests erupted throughout the island in recent days.Members of both parties have supported calls for Rosselló’s departure from office, including Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro.Rosselló had previously stated he would remain in office and even deal with impeachment, but would not seek re-election. In a Monday interview with Fox News' Shepard Smith, he illustrated his plans to continue as governor.“My effort and my commitment is to follow through on some of the efforts that I've established for the people of Puerto Rico,” Rosselló said. “That includes establishing, again, a plan that I've already circulated with members within the White House so that we can battle this corruption, so that we can tackle what government employees are doing, what we are doing as elected officials, and a collaboration with the federal government.""Fox News’ Bryan Llenas, Ivonne Amor, Andrew O'Reilly and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/puerto-rico-gov-ricardo-rossello-resign-source,Fox,Conservative
78,Puerto Rico begins impeachment against Gov. Ricardo Rosselló,Tamar Lapin,2019-07-24,"Puerto Rico’s legislature has begun an impeachment process against embattled Governor Ricardo Rosselló, a senior lawmaker said Wednesday. This comes after a probe into leaked Telegram app chat messages between Rosselló and his advisers found that crimes may have been committed during the conversations. “The impeachment process has started,” Johnny Mendez, speaker of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives and a member of Rossello’s party who was targeted in the chats, told Reuters. An independent panel of lawyers commissioned by Mendez to look into the messages found four felonies and one misdemeanor may have been committed during the group chats, one of the attorneys said. The scandal — dubbed “Rickyleaks” in local media — has sparked nearly two weeks of protests demanding the ouster of Rosselló. Local media, including El Nuevo Día newspaper, cited unnamed sources early Wednesday as saying Rosselló’s resignation was imminent. A spokesman for the first-term governor said Rosselló is still weighing his options. “Whichever decision he makes will, as always, be communicated officially,” Anthony Maceira said. The governor’s chief of staff Ricardo Llerandi resigned on Tuesday, citing concerns for his family’s safety.

52,Puerto Rico judge issues search warrants for embattled governor and aides as protests continue,Andrew O'Reilly   ,2019-07-23,"Puerto Rican official Tuesday confirmed that search warrants have been issued in the investigation into Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and 11 of his aides. Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice confirmed to Fox News that search warrants were issued as officials in the U.S. territory look into whether any criminal or ethical crimes were committed in the so called “chatgate” controversy.“I can confirm search warrants have been issued. This is an ongoing investigation and we can’t comment further,” Mariana Cobián, the press director for Justice Department of Puerto Rico, told Fox News’ Bryan Llenas. Cobián would not say how many warrants were issued or what they were for. Territorial Justice Department spokesman Kelvin Carrasco told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the warrants were approved overnight and were issued for those who have not yet turned over their phones. He did not name the officials and declined further comment because the investigation is ongoing.The warrants come two days after Rosselló, a Democrat, announced that he would not seek re-election amid the corruption allegations that have led to widespread protests across the island. The governor, however, has so far refused to give in to demands by protesters for him to step down from his post.Rosselló dug his heels in late Monday after what seemed to have been the biggest protest the island has seen in nearly two decades. He told Fox News that he has already apologized and made amends following the leak of an offensive, obscenity-laden online chat among him and his advisers that triggered the crisis.Many Puerto Ricans have been calling for Rosselló’s resignation after  the leaked online chats showed him insulting women and political opponents as well as mocking victims of Hurricane Maria, one of the most devastating natural disasters to hit the island territory.Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism earlier this month published nearly 900 pages of private messages between Rosselló and several other government officials. In one message Rosselló called one New York female politician of Puerto Rican descent a “w---e” and described another as a “daughter of a b---h.” One chat also made vulgar references to Latin pop star Ricky Martin’s homosexuality. His official residence has been under siege in the aftermath, as hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered outside La Fortaleza, the governor’s official residence.

79,"Puerto Rico governor, aides ordered to turn over cellphones",Kate Sheehy,2019-07-23,"Federal authorities in Puerto Rico have ordered Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and 11 of his aides to turn over their cellphones as part of a growing probe into his leaked offensive chat with advisers, officials said Tuesday. A spokesman with the US territory’s Department of Justice said warrants for the phones were issued overnight. The rep would not identify whose phones were being targeted, but CBS said Rosselló was among the dozen. Justice officials added to Fox News that the warrants were tied to the beleaguered island’s so-called “chatgate.” The development came as Rosselló’s top ally in Washington, DC — the head of the agency that represents Puerto Rico in the States — revealed that he has resigned amid the turmoil. “It is very sad and disappointing for me to see the events and revelations that have come about in the past few days, which directly contradict my personal and professional values and ethics,” George Laws Garcia, acting director of the Puerto Rican Federal Affairs Administration, wrote in a letter dated Saturday and addressed to Rosselló. “Unfortunately, these circumstances make it impossible for me to continue working for you and representing the government of Puerto Rico, at this time,’’ Garcia said in the letter, a copy of which was tweeted out by the co-host of the political podcast “In the Thick,’’ Julio Ricardo Varela. Meanwhile, Tuesday marked the 11th day that the island has been rocked by massive protests since the publication of the profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic phone chats between Rosselló and aides. In one chat, Rosselló called former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is from Puerto Rico, a “whore” in Spanish. He has since apologized. Rosselló’s chief fiscal officer, Christian Sobrino Vega, also sneered in another missive that Ricky Martin, the island’s gay superstar singer, “is such a male chauvinist that he f—ks men because women don’t measure up.” Some of the outrageous messages even mocked the victims of deadly Hurricane Maria, whose devastating effects are still being felt on the debt-riddled island two years later. Rosselló, who refused to step down Sunday, which ramped up the protests against him, appeared on Fox News on Monday to say he’d already apologized and was moving on. But news host Shepard Smith wasn’t having it. “The corruption was in your own administration,” Smith said. “Five people who were on those chats, you got rid of all of them, they are now out of the government, but you remain. Doesn’t the buck stop with your office, Governor?” Rosselló responded, “I was elected by the people of Puerto Rico.” Smith replied, “And those people are on the streets of your biggest city today saying, ‘We want you out.’” When the TV anchor pushed Rosselló to name one person who has publicly defended him, the governor said Javier Jiménez, the mayor of San Sebastian. Jimenez later told Fox, “It’s not true that I support the governor.” Police in riot gear ended up firing tear gas at anti-Rosselló protesters in the capital city of San Juan on Monday night to beat them back. Puerto Rico House Speaker Carlos Mendez, who is in Rosselló’s own party, has already called for an independent panel to weigh whether the governor should be impeached over the messages. The governor’s administration has been dogged by corruption allegations, too, in which six people have been charged with crimes including conspiracy. The allegations involve millions of dollars in federal health care and education funds. The island is reeling in debt to boot — with at least $74 billion in unpaid bills.

55,Puerto Rico governor tells Fox News he 'assumes responsibility' for actions in first one-on-one interview since scandal began,Talia Kaplan   ,2019-07-22,"Embattled Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told Fox News on Monday he “assumes responsibility” for his actions that have sparked widespread protests and calls for his resignation, in his first one-on-one interview since the scandal began.During the heated interview on “Shepard Smith Reporting,” the governor, a Democrat and member of the territory's New Progressive Party (PNP), added he will “make an effort for reconciliation” in the wake of allegations of corruption and insulting the people of Puerto Rico, including victims of Hurricane Maria.When Shepard Smith asked Rosselló why he wouldn’t step down as governor especially given all the protests, he answered: “There's an important component about rule of law and democracy, and I respect that process. We will have, and we will propose, certain mechanisms so that within the future that process can go forward.”He added, “My contention is that I need to work beyond politics so that we can address some of the long-standing problems of corruption here in Puerto Rico and fix that problem.”Rosselló announced Sunday he will not seek re-election but refused to resign, as allegations of corruption and insulting his people led nearly 100,000 protesters to take to the streets in and around the capital city, San Juan.“I've seen the [protests], I've heard the people talk. I've had a process of introspection and I did. I have made a decision I'm not going to run. I'm not going to seek re-election. And that way I can focus on the job at hand,” Rosselló told Smith on Monday. “You know, I've had the biggest recovery effort in the modern history of the United States on our hands. We're battling corruption with certain initiatives that we've already started, and certain new ones that we want to put out there, so that we can fix the problem.”Many Puerto Ricans have been calling for Rosselló’s resignation after leaked online chats showed him insulting women and political opponents as well as mocking victims of Hurricane Maria, one of the most devastating natural disasters to hit the island territory.Rosselló said Sunday in a Facebook video that he agreed with the people's right to protest and was willing to confront the impeachment process, which already had begun in Puerto Rico's legislature. He said although he will not resign as the island's leader, he will step down as head of his pro-statehood party.Smith interrupted Rosselló during Monday's interview by pointing out the “attacks” he made on women, homosexuals and “on the dead relatives of your own residents across your own island.” Smith then asked, “After all that, who's left to support you? And is it even safe for you to continue to attempt to govern?”Rosselló answered, “I’ve apologized for that. I’m making amends for all those efforts.”Smith asked, “You’ve apologized for what specifically, governor?” Rosselló responded, “For all of the comments that I’ve made on the chats.” He added, “There’s another effort that needs to move forward which is the battling of corruption.” Smith then interrupted Rosselló again, saying, “The corruption was in your own administration, 15-and-a-half million dollars and five people who were on those chats, you got rid of all of them. They are now out of the government but you remain. Doesn’t the buck stop with your office, governor?”“That’s right, but I was elected by the people of Puerto Rico,” Rosselló answered. “Those people are on the streets of your biggest city today saying, ‘We want you out.’ That’s the headline in the main newspaper and the politicians on both sides of the political aisle on your own island are saying the exact same thing,” Smith said. “You’re a man on an island by yourself, how long can you stay there?” Smith asked. “My effort and my commitment is to follow through on some of the efforts that I've established for the people of Puerto Rico,” Rosselló said in response. “That includes establishing, again, a plan that I've already circulated with members within the White House so that we can battle this corruption, so that we can tackle what government employees are doing, what we are doing as elected officials, and a collaboration with the federal government. This is the biggest recovery effort in the United States, history.”In Sunday's Facebook video, Rosselló acknowledged his “mistakes” and pointed out that he had apologized in the past. He did not offer a formal apology in Sunday’s video and did not immediately offer an apology during the interview with Smith on Monday. Earlier this month, Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published nearly 900 pages of private messages between Rosselló and several other government officials.In one message Rosselló called one New York female politician of Puerto Rican descent a “w---e” and described another as a “daughter of a b---h.” One chat also made vulgar references to Latin pop star Ricky Martin’s homosexuality.During Monday’s live interview, Smith asked Rosselló why he continuously said he's apologized for his “mistakes,” pointing out that the word usually refers to “things you did by accident,” which Smith said was not represented by the 900 pages of attacks on people on his own island. When Smith asked Rosselló if he would want a person like that leading him, Rosselló responded by saying, “I would want to showcase my record.” He eventually apologized to the people he had offended, including Martin, after Smith had asked Rosselló if he had apologized “sufficiently.”“Everything that was said I assume responsibility for. I apologize for it,"" Rosselló told Smith.He added, “My focus is to make sure that the policy that we have enacted moves forward.”Amid the outcry, the media-friendly governor largely has avoided public appearances since July 11, making only four brief appearances, breaking from his usual three or four lengthy news conferences in addition to multiple media appearances.The calls to oust the governor have caught the attention in the mainland U.S. and several officials, including presidential candidate Julián Castro, have come out in support of the protesters.Castro, a Democrat, openly called on Rosselló to step down, saying “it’s clear that Gov. Rosselló can no longer be effective.”President Trump on Monday blasted Rosselló as a “terrible governor.” “The governor is not good,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “The U.S. gave Puerto Rico $92 billion and it’s in the hands of terrible and corrupt people... You have grossly incompetent leadership.”Some well-known athletes with ties to the island also urged the governor to resign last week, including the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Enrique Hernandez and the St. Louis Cardinals’ Yadier Molina.During a July 11 news conference, Rosselló asked Puerto Ricans to forgive him for the comments he made in private.

81,"Trump rips governor of Puerto Rico, San Juan mayor",Bob Fredericks,2019-07-18,"President Trump on Thursday ripped the embattled governor of Puerto Rico, joining a growing chorus of critics that includes entertainer Ricky Martin and Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora. The commander-in-chief also took a shot at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, whom he has feuded with since Hurricane Maria devastated the US commonwealth in September 2017. “A lot of bad things are happening in Puerto Rico. The Governor is under siege, the Mayor of San Juan is a despicable and incompetent person who I wouldn’t trust under any circumstance, and the United States Congress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief, much of which was squandered away or wasted, never to be seen again,” the president wrote on Twitter. “This is more than twice the amount given to Texas & Florida combined. I know the people of Puerto Rico well, and they are great. But much of their leadership is corrupt, & robbing the U.S. Government blind!” Gov. Ricardo Roselló has been under fire since it was revealed by Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism that he and other top officials had made sexist and other offensive remarks in text messages. In one message, the governor called ex-New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito a “whore”; said that if someone were to murder Yulín Cruz, they “would be doing him a favor”; made homophobic remarks about Martin, and attacked journalists and political opponents. Thousands have rallied to demand his resignation, and Yulín Cruz applauded the demonstrators on Twitter. “It is the greatest honor to be part of a society that knows that democracy is not a once every four year exercise but a constant movement towards equality,” she wrote. Roselló, however, has said he wasn’t going to resign. Trump has criticized Puerto Rican officials in the past over the hurricane response and the amount of aid the federal government has provided. Fact checkers say that $41 billion has been allocated and that the island had received $11.2 billion as of April. The president’s figure is based on an administration calculation of how much will eventually be spent over the next 20 years.

59,Puerto Rico governor refuses to step down amid corruption and texting scandals,Louis Casiano   ,2019-07-16,"Embattled Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló refused to step down Tuesday amid demonstrations calling for his resignation after a series of scandals that continue to rock his administration of the island territory.“Aside from these [protests] I recognize their importance, I recognize the magnitude, and it’s important to me that the government continues working for the island and we get results,” he said at a news conference, according to McClatchy D.C.Rosselló's government was thrown into chaos Saturday after the Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico released 889 pages containing sexist, homophobic and profane text messages from the encrypted app Telegram between him and 11 other male members of his administration.The chat group included Luis Rivera Marín, Rosselló's secretary of state; Christian Sobrino, who held a series of important economic posts; Carlos Bermúdez, a onetime communications aide; Edwin Miranda, a communications consultant; Interior Secretary Ricardo Llerandi; Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira; and Elías Sánchez, onetime representative to the board overseeing Puerto Rico's bankruptcyIn the leaks, Rosselló describes New York politician Melissa Mark-Viverito, who was born in Puerto Rico, as the Spanish word for ""wh---,"" and made fun of Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin for being gay.San Juan Mayor -- and frequent critic of President Trump -- Carmen Yulin Cruz was also targeted.  “I’m dying to shoot her up,” Rosselló’s chief financial officer, Christian Sobrino, said of Cruz in the chat.The chat also contained emojis of a raised middle finger directed at the federal control board that oversees the island's finances. Rivera Marín, Sobrino, Bermúdez and Miranda have already resigned or been fired.The leaks came days after six former government officials and contractors, including the commonwealth's former education secretary, were arrested in a federal corruption probe.Protesters took to the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan on Monday evening holding signs and chanting, ""Ricky, renuncia,"" or Ricky, resign. Some participants spray-painted insults used in the chats on walls.Rosselló said 21 police officers were injured during confrontations with the crowd; police used tear gas to disperse protesters who lit fireworks in front of the governor's mansion.“We cannot protect vandalism, aggression and violence,” the governor said. “I want to make sure that following this blow, we can rise again.”The scandals are a blow to Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from the devastation left by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and a continuing debt crisis and 13-year recession.Rosselló's refusal to resign has elicited outrage from Puerto Ricans in Florida, many whom migrated after the hurricane.“The institutions of government in Puerto Rico are as fragile as its infrastructure after Maria,” Jorge Bonilla, a conservative Puerto Rican talk-show host based in Central Florida, told McClatchy. “I think it’s unsustainable that he continues to be governor. ... At this point you have to wonder what more can happen before Congress takes control” of the island.”Members of Rosselló's pro-statehood New Progressive Party do not support beginning impeachment proceedings against him, said Carlos Méndez Núñez, the president of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives.He said Rosselló was given a one-week deadline to show he can govern.""This week he'll meet with mayors, with legislators, and we have to give him this time,"" Méndez Núñez said.

82,Royal Caribbean cruise ship cancels Puerto Rico stop amid violent protests,Kenneth Garger,2019-07-16,"A Royal Caribbean International cruise ship reportedly skipped a scheduled stop in Puerto Rico Tuesday amid violent protests against the governor in the commonwealth’s capital. “In light of current unrest in San Juan, Puerto Rico, we have canceled today’s call to San Juan,” Owen Torres, spokesman for Royal Caribbean told USA TODAY. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make adjustments as necessary to ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew.” The ship Empress of the Seas was slated to arrive in San Juan. The vessel was instead rerouted to the British Virgin Islands, the report said. Protesters gathered in the capital Monday, calling for the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rossello after the leak of a series of controversial and vulgar texts between the governor and his closest allies. In one of the leaked messages, Rossello called former City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito a “whore.” He later issued a public apology for the comments. Rossello’s administration has also been the target of an FBI corruption probe that led to the arrests of two of his former top officials. Monday night’s demonstration turned violent, resulting in the injuries of 21 law enforcement agents during a standoff with protesters. Despite the unrest, Rossello said Tuesday he will stay in office.

60,Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rosselló rejects calls to resign over profanity-laced chat,Robert Gearty   ,2019-07-15,"Puerto Rico’s embattled governor on Monday continued to reject calls for his resignation over a lengthy profane, vulgar and homophobic chat he participated in with close advisors on an encrypted app -- and that was later leaked to investigative reporters.The scandal has already claimed the jobs of two top aides to Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, but the governor doesn't plan to join his staffers, saying Sunday at a church in San Juan he would look to God to guide him through “figurative or real” hurricanes.He said his ""commitment is to learn from what was done"" and continue ""advancing efforts so that Puerto Rico can move forward,"" the Associated Press reported.Police stood guard in front of the governor’s residence in San Juan Sunday as protestors gathered near the padlocked main doors and chanted, “Ricky resign, the people don’t want you.”The leaked chat from the encrypted messaging app Telegram was obtained by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism.In the chat, which involved 11 top government officials and political aides, Rosselló called former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito the Spanish word for ""wh---,"" and, in English, told Puerto Rico’s financial oversight board to ""go f--- yourself"" followed by a string of emojis with the middle finger raised.""A person who uses that language against a woman, whether a public figure or not, should not govern Puerto Rico...this type of behavior is completely unacceptable,"" Mark-Viverito said.Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin, who was the subject of a homophobic comment in the chat, also urged Rosselló to step down. Another target was San Juan mayor -- and President Trump antagonist -- Carmen Yulin Cruz.“I’m dying to shoot her up,” Rosselló’s chief financial officer Christian Sobrino -- one of the governor’s aides who lost his job -- said of Cruz in the chat, according to CBS News.“You’d be doing me a big favor,” Rosselló replied.The political turmoil comes as Puerto Rico already faces challenges from the impact of a 13-year recession, a debt crisis and the onslaught of Hurricane Maria in 2017.It also comes days after FBI agents arrested Julia Keleher, Puerto Rico's former education secretary, and five others on charges of steering federal money to unqualified, politically connected contractors..",https://www.foxnews.com/us/puerto-rico-governor-rejects-calls-to-resign-over-profanity-laced-chat,Fox,Conservative
83,Toddler takes fatal plunge from cruise ship in Puerto Rico: reports,Tamar Lapin,2019-07-07,"A 1½-year-old girl died Sunday after falling from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship docked in Puerto Rico, local reports said. The toddler was being held by her grandfather when she slipped out of his arms and plunged from the 11th floor of the Freedom of the Seas to the concrete on the Pan American dock II in San Juan, Telemundo PR reported. According to local outlet Primera Hora, the girl and her family, including her maternal and paternal grandparents, parents and a younger brother, are from Indiana. Later on Sunday afternoon, the captain of the ship gave his condolences to the families and announced that the boat’s departure would be delayed, the outlet reported. Local investigators are interviewing passengers who witnessed the tragic fall and relatives who were present. They are also making arrangements to obtain any security footage from the ship, according to the report. Royal Caribbean said in a statement Monday: “We are deeply saddened by yesterday’s tragic incident, and our hearts go out to the family. We’ve made our Care Team available to assist the family with any resources they need. Out of respect for their privacy, we do not plan to comment further on the incident.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/07/07/toddler-takes-fatal-plunge-from-cruise-ship-in-puerto-rico-reports/,New York Post,Conservative
84,Puerto Rico promises tax breaks in attempt to lure ‘family offices’,John Crudele,2019-05-22,"Watch out, Connecticut. Heads up, New Jersey. And New York had better pay attention too. Puerto Rico is coming after one of your lucrative industries – the ultra-high net worth financial advisory business, also known as “family offices.” And since most people who live in Puerto Rico don’t pay federal income tax, the island has been selling itself as a better income tax haven than even Florida, which doesn’t have any state tax but where Federal taxes as high as 37 percent are still paid to Washington. Florida is already luring financial companies from the tax-heavy northeast. One of the biggest losses was when hedge fund billionaire David Tepper left New Jersey for Florida leaving Jersey will a hole in its tax base. Puerto Rico apparently wants some of that action. Case in point: in late February, I’m told, Puerto Rico invited representatives of 150 family offices to the island. The agenda was not only to get them to invest in Puerto Rico but also to proposition them to move their operations to the unincorporated territory of the U.S. The pitch, according to someone who was invited, was that the state income tax for those who moved would only be 4 percent a year. That compares to around 7 percent for high income people who work in Connecticut; nearly 9 percent in New York State and about 11 percent in New Jersey. New York City also collects up to nearly 4 percent tax on big incomes in addition to what New York State gets. Add the Federal tax on top of that and Puerto Rico is clearly the winner. Of course, wealthy people use tax dodges like trusts to protect income from taxation. But, still, the lure of low-tax Puerto Rico has been good enough in the past to bring industries like pharmaceuticals to the island. The junket for family offices was held on Feb. 26, I’m told. It lasted three days and guests were put up at the swanky Condado Vanderbilt Hotel in San Juan and all expenses were paid – although the people invited surely didn’t need the freebies. The Condado Vanderbilt and sister hotels, incidentally, are owned by Paulson & Co. John Paulson, head of that firm, said earlier this year that he might get out of the hedge fund business and turn his billion dollar fortune over to a family office of his own. A Paulson spokesman wouldn’t comment on whether it was planning to move Puerto Rico. The company is now located in Manhattan. The one catch is that anyone working at a family office that relocates to Puerto Rico would have to spend at least half the year on the island or they lose the tax break. Making that a little easier, the family offices reps were told that anytime they traveled off the island on business would be counted toward their residency requirement, according to my sources. I have a call into Puerto Rico officials to see if anyone took them up on the offer or was investing. As you probably heard, Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Island officials and others have criticized the Trump administration’s response to the devastation.

85,"Trump pledges more disaster money to Florida, says Puerto Rico should be ‘grateful’",Nikki Schwab,2019-05-08,"WASHINGTON – At a campaign rally in Panama City Beach Florida, President Trump promised Floridians more disaster dollars, while suggesting Puerto Ricans should be “grateful” for his administration’s response. The president pledged to give $448 million in HUD disaster recovery funds to the state, so that residents can continue to rebound from the Category 5 Hurricane Michael, which hit in October 2018. “That was not a nice hurricane, I can tell you that. But it’s going well,” Trump told the crowd. “We will have the federal government pay for 90 percent of the cost in many circumstances,” he said of the rebuild. While talking hurricane recovery, the president whipped out a standard-sized paper chart to show how much the government spent on Puerto Rico. “I didn’t want it on a big board because that costs the government too much money,” he said of his print-out, which showed a bar chart, with the tallest bar going to Puerto Rico, the island territory decimated by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The storm caused nearly 3,000 deaths. “Puerto Rico got $91 billion and I understand they don’t like me,” Trump said, repeating a statistic that earned him “three Pinocchios” from the Washington Post’s fact checker. So far, $11.2 billion has been spent on Puerto Rico with another $40.8 billion allocated. The $91 billion figure comes from an Office of Management and Budget estimate of possible liabilities over the next 20 years. “But you’re getting your money one way or another and we’re not going to let anybody hold it up,” Trump told the Florida crowd. “And I think that the people of Puerto Rico are very grateful to Donald Trump for what we’ve done for them,” he said. During his nearly hour and a half long speech, Trump zigged and zagged, touching on the latest news – the House Judiciary Committee voting to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt – and his accomplishments. “We have a great attorney general – now the Democrats are saying, ‘We want more.’ Now they say the Mueller report. We want to start all over again. It is a disgrace.” Trump deployed greatest hits, like criticizing Hillary Clinton’s 2016 run – earning the predictable “Lock her up!” chant. He went even further back, reminding his supporters what he had said on the day he announced his presidential run. “I talked about what’s happening. I mention the word rape,” he recalled. “I was absolutely, by the fake news media, they went after me. Guess what? That speech was so mild compared to what’s actually happening,” Trump continued, alluding to some of the horror stories from migrants trying to cross over the southern border. His immigration chatter inspired several chants of, “Build the wall.” That, Trump said, could be a solution, as the U.S. doesn’t allow border patrol agents to use weapons against them. “But how do you stop these people?” the president asked. “Shoot them!” someone called out from the crowd. With that, the president shook his head. “That’s only in the panhandle you can get away with that statement,” Trump said. “Only in the panhandle.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/05/08/trump-pledges-more-disaster-money-to-florida-says-puerto-rico-should-be-grateful/,New York Post,Conservative
86,Puerto Rico won’t recover from bankruptcy unless it embraces fiscal reform,Jose Carrion,2019-04-29,"Puerto Rico is in trouble. Hurricane Maria battered the island in 2017, killing nearly 3,000 people, destroying 85% of the housing stock and causing $90 billion in damage. More than 18 months later, federal and local authorities and aid agencies are still working to rebuild the physical infrastructure and to make whole lives shattered by the Category 4 catastrophe — or as whole as they can be made. As if that weren’t enough, Puerto Rico has also suffered from a financial storm. Years of local-government fiscal mismanagement created a debt burden of more than $70 billion. That, plus $60 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, a culture of government officials making promises they couldn’t afford and a decade of recession have combined to engulf the island in a sea of red ink. But now there is a way forward. Today, Puerto Rico finally has the fiscal oversight it needs to succeed. I am a Puerto Rican, a resident of and a taxpayer in San Juan, a businessman and an entrepreneur. I also serve as the chairman of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, which Congress has tasked with getting Puerto Rico through its bankruptcy and ensuring fiscal discipline and balanced budgets. The sources of Puerto Rico’s ­unsustainable $130 billion debt burden are many, including years of bad governance, irresponsible spending, lack of transparency about how taxpayer dollars were spent and long-term structural economic deterioration that was brought about by the issuing of additional debt as opposed to budgetary tightening. There is plenty of blame to go around. Elected officials’ lack of accountability created distrust among the people of Puerto Rico. Governments kept borrowing, and creditors irresponsibly kept lending despite our fiscal reality. Puerto Rico’s economic model didn’t welcome investors and job creators in the right way. Instead, it pushed away investors. Puerto Rico inevitably defaulted and now has to reform itself to get back to fiscal health. The oversight board is imposing budgetary discipline and making the case for deep economic ­reforms. Thus far, the board has successfully renegotiated some of the island’s debt, and we are working on agreements with the other creditors. There are several reforms ­Puerto Rico could take on, including welfare-to-work measures and making Puerto Rico an employee-at-will state. Unfortunately, the current government isn’t implementing all of these reforms, despite the fact that they could make Puerto Rico much easier to do business in and present a better case for attracting investments. Puerto Rico now has a chance to get this right. Part of the oversight board’s work is to ensure that President Trump’s concerns are addressed: making sure federal funds are managed wisely at all levels of ­Puerto Rico’s government. No federal funds will be used to pay ­Puerto Rico’s debt. But the local government needs to step up, make the hard choices to reduce spending while improving necessary public services. We can’t waste time in implementing ­reforms, modernizing the energy industry and making ­Puerto Rico a more attractive place to do business and a more competitive market. Jobs and investment will come when government is transparent, when it’s easier to hire and fire workers and when bureaucrats get out of the way of investors. This has to happen as soon as possible. And with political will, we can do it ourselves. That’s when the board will disappear. Until then, we will continue our work to help turn ­Puerto Rico around and make sure its people have the opportunities and future they deserve. José B. Carrión III is the chairman of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico. He is also chairman of HUB International.

61,"US military to provide medical care, training to Puerto Rico",Hollie McKay   ,2019-04-24,"While the issue of federal funding for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico continues to remain a point of contention in Washington, the U.S. military is endeavoring to play a quieter role away from the political posturing.From April 25 through to May 8, the Department of Defense’s Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) will partner with Puerto Rico’s Government Mental Health and Anti-Addiction Services Administration for a “Healing Wave of Hope” mission, aimed at providing locals with health care in Ponce, Jayuya, Lares, Maricao, Mayaguez and Yauco in addition to training local providers.“The IRT missions allow our force to have hands-on, real-world training to improve readiness and survivability in contingency environments. It is also an opportunity to strengthen and build new partnerships with different populations, often in remote areas,” LTC Carlos M. Cuebas, Chief Public Affairs for the U.S. Army Reserve Virgin Islands & Puerto Rico, told Fox News. “IRT is a collaborative program that that leverages military contributions and community resources to multiply value and cost savings for participants.”Some of the services to be provided are physical exams, sports physicals, blood pressure/disease screenings, dental exams, extractions, and fillings, and vision screenings.The IRT program, which was first conceived in 1992 as a means of providing “realistic training in a joint environment in order to prepare U.S. military members to perform similar duties during a crisis at home or abroad,” is expected to tend to undertake more than 9,000 medical procedures throughout the two-week deployment.And although it is not directly linked to hurricane relief, some 19 months after Hurricane Maria ripped through and claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, U.S. military brass are hopeful that the training and treatment will provide some reprieve and ensure that Puerto Rico is better equipped to deal with any future calamities that may strike.“IRT provides key services with lasting benefits for our communities,” Cuebas added.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-military-medical-care-training-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative
87,Puerto Rico suffered ‘greatest population drop in history’ after Hurricane Maria,Associated Press,2019-04-18,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — New Census Bureau data shows Puerto Rico lost nearly 4 percent of its population after Hurricane Maria — the greatest population drop in the recorded history of the island, according to one demographer. Data released Thursday shows the US territory’s population dropped by 129,848 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The hurricane struck two months into that period, in September 2017. The population loss was due to both deaths and people moving away, although emigration accounted for most of the drop. The heaviest population drops occurred in metropolitan areas such as the capital of San Juan, the city of Ponce and surrounding areas. “It’s the largest population drop seen in a single year ever registered in Puerto Rico,” demographer Raúl Figueroa said. The census numbers show there were 6,449 more deaths than births during the 12 months in question, a normal figure, even though there were several thousand more deaths than normal in the months immediately following the hurricane. Many of those excess deaths following the hurricane were of sick and elderly people who would have died sometime in the year in the question, Figueroa said. Deaths for the year may have been concentrated right after the storm due to the lack of electricity, services and fresh water. He said he thinks emigration slowed in 2019 and the population has begun to slowly recover. Many Puerto Ricans left for Florida and New York, home to communities of people from the territory. Sister Carmen Negrón of the Society of the Sacred Heart sells handmade rosaries and religious icons in a narrow passage in the Plaza del Mercado in the Rio Piedras area of San Juan. She said she has noticed a drop in sales due to what seem to be fewer people in the area. “This area’s been shrinking,” Negron said. “Sales are down.” The San Juan area lost 81,087 people, a 3.9 percent drop, in the 12 months covered by the Census Bureau report. Paseo de Diego, the central thoroughfare in Rio Piedras, was filled years ago with stores that are closed and empty today. “You see fewer people around, fewer young people,” said Wilfredo Montañez, who was sitting on a bench in the plaza. Magaly Robles has been selling roast potatoes outside the plaza for 15 years. A native of the Dominican Republic, she said that because she has a job, she has no intention of moving again. “Lots of people have left since Maria,” Robles said. “Many of my friends have gone and not come back.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/04/18/puerto-rico-suffered-greatest-population-drop-in-history-after-hurricane-maria/,New York Post,Conservative

Does he have a vendetta against the people of the island?” MSNBC host Chris Hayes asked.“You know, the president had a golf course here, which many people may not have remembered, and it went bankrupt. I don’t know if that is the root of his vindictive behavior towards Puerto Rico,” Cruz responded, “but he’s also insensitive and he’s also prone to classic Donald Trump temper tantrums.

88,Trump lashes out at Democrats over Puerto Rico aid vote,Mark Moore,2019-04-02,"President Trump lashed out at Senate Democrats for voting against a GOP-backed disaster bill that would have aided US farmers but that Democrats argued didn’t go far enough to help hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. In a series of five tweets he began posting late Monday and continued sending Tuesday morning, Trump called the Caribbean island a “mess” and said its politicians “are incompetent or corrupt.” “The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any ‘place’ in history,” the president posted on his Twitter page Monday evening. After calling Puerto Ricans “GREAT” and the territory’s lawmakers “corrupt,” Trump railed that “their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess – nothing works.” “FEMA & the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health,” Trump continued. “91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello also took to Twitter to remind Trump that the “place” the president referred to “is home to over three million proud Americans that are still recovering from the storm and in need of federal assistance. We are not your adversaries, we are your citizens.” He also urged the president to “STOP spreading misinformation,” saying FEMA has approved only $300 million in permanent work projects, not $91 billion. “It’s not ‘us’ vs ‘them’. It’s about Americans in need,” Rossello wrote. The $91 billion number Trump harps on is a combination of the $41 billion set aside for recovery and the $50 billion that will be spent over the course of the effort, which could last decades, the Washington Post reported. So far, $11 billion has been sent to Puerto Rico. Trump continued his onslaught against Puerto Rico Tuesday morning after taking a break of about eight hours, claiming that all their “politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA.” “The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump,” he concluded Tuesday morning. The tweetstorm was in reaction to Democrats blocking a disaster bill Monday that would have provided assistance to victims of hurricanes in Florida, George and North Carolina, floods in the South and Midwest, and wildfires in California. The GOP-sponsored bill would have provided $13.45 billion in funding, but Democrats said the $600 million allocated for Puerto Rico wasn’t enough to help the island recover from Hurricane Maria. And, according to a study published by BMJ Global Health, the federal response after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida was “faster and more generous” than the response to Puerto Rico after Maria. In the nine-day period after the hurricanes struck, people in Florida and Texas received nearly $100 million from FEMA, while Puerto Ricans got roughly $6 million.

63,"Puerto Rico governor cautions White House: 'If the bully gets close, I'll punch the bully in the mouth'",Elizabeth Zwirz   ,2019-03-28,"The governor of Puerto Rico on Thursday reportedly vowed to take a stand, if necessary, against the White House amid recent discussions surrounding disaster aid for the U.S. island territory previously devastated by hurricanes.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s remarks came during an interview with CNN, after being asked whether it “sometimes” felt like he was “dealing with a bully.”“If the bully gets close, I’ll punch the bully in the mouth,” Rosselló said, adding that “it would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage.”The governor also told the network that the president treats Puerto Ricans “as second-class citizens.”“And my consideration is, I just want to have the opportunity to explain to him why the data and information that he’s getting is wrong,” he said. “I don’t think getting into a kicking and screaming match with the president does any good. I don’t think anybody can beat the president on a kicking and screaming match.”“I think that what I am aiming to do is making sure that reason prevails, that empathy prevails, that equality prevails and that we can have a discussion,” he continued.President Trump reportedly expressed his opposition this week to allotting further disaster aid to Puerto Rico, with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saying the president told Republicans at a closed-door luncheon on Tuesday that aid for the territory ""is way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.""Trump also told reporters on Thursday that Puerto Rico has been well-looked after under his leadership and claimed that $91 billion was allocated to the U.S. territory, a figure which he said was substantially more than what was set aside for Texas or Florida. It’s unclear how he arrived at the number.“Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being. And I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it,” he said.“But you do have a mayor of San Juan that frankly doesn’t know what she’s doing.

89,"Puerto Rico governor to Trump admin: ‘If the bully gets close, I’ll punch the bully’",Chris Perez,2019-03-28,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló continued to fire shots at President Trump on Thursday — warning that “if the bully gets close, I’ll punch the bully in the mouth” — following a reported spat at the White House between his top aides and US officials. “It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage,” Rosselló told CNN. The two leaders have been sparring this week over Hurricane Maria relief efforts after Trump reportedly told senators in a private meeting that he thought Puerto Rico was getting too much aid. Puerto Rico officials were in Washington on Thursday trying to schedule a meeting with Trump to talk about what he reportedly said and discuss the island’s increasingly grim situation following several failed attempts to do so, according to CNN. Rosselló’s people told the media outlet that White House officials tried brushing them off yet again — saying, “You guys have to f***ing stop with the meeting request.” “Your governor is f***ing things up,” said trade adviser Peter Navarro, according to sources who attended the meeting and spoke to CNN. White House officials denied making the comments and said they were working to connect with Rosselló and his aides. “The White House recently helped set up important meetings between Governor Rossello and HUD and FEMA leadership,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement to CNN. “We understand that the governor is not visiting until later in April and we look forward to once again helping set up productive conversations with Administration leaders to discuss the island’s recovery.” Trump’s comments about the Hurricane Maria relief efforts came Tuesday on Capitol Hill, according to the Washington Post. Rosselló called him out later that evening, saying his suggestion to cut aid was “below the dignity of a sitting President.” He reiterated the statement Thursday during his interview with CNN. “It’s unfortunate that we are having to hear this,” Rosselló said. “These statements lack empathy, but more so they lack the true facts of the matter. They’re not aligned with the truth and reality, No. 1. And No. 2, I just think we have to end this battle of words and just recognize we’re not his political adversaries, we’re his citizens.” Trump has previously said he thought Puerto Rico was wasting the hurricane relief aid it was receiving. He fired off a series of tweets in 2017 saying the island’s ongoing financial crisis was “largely of their own making.” “Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes,” Trump said. Rosselló blasted Trump’s reported beliefs about what was going on in the US territory, telling CNN that he “treats us as second-class citizens.” “I just want the opportunity to explain to him why the data and information he’s getting is wrong,” Rosselló said. “I don’t think getting into a kicking and screaming match with the president does any good. I don’t think anyone can beat the president in a kicking and screaming match. What I am aiming to do is make sure reason prevails, that empathy prevails, that equality prevails, and that we can have a discussion.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/03/28/puerto-rico-governor-to-trump-admin-if-the-bully-gets-close-ill-punch-the-bully/,New York Post,Conservative
90,Puerto Rico governor: Trump still has it wrong about Hurricane Maria recovery,Mark Moore,2019-03-27,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló called out President Trump’s remarks that aid to the hurricane-ravaged Caribbean island should be cut off as “below the dignity of a sitting President.” Trump, in a private meeting with Republican senators on Tuesday, complained that Puerto Rico was getting $91 billion in aid — an amount much larger than that delivered to Texas and South Carolina after hurricanes struck those states in 2017. He told the Republican lawmakers that Puerto Rico could be bought four times over for that amount, the Washington Post reported. “The comments attributed to Donald Trump today by senators from his own party are below the dignity of a sitting President of the United States,” Rosselló said in a statement released late Tuesday after details of the meeting appeared in media reports. “They continue to lack empathy, are irresponsible, regrettable and, above all, unjustified.” The $91 billion figure appears to be an exaggeration of how much the US territory has received but seems closer to estimated damage to Puerto Rico, the Washington Post reported. Rosselló suggested that Trump was getting incorrect information from his staff and invited the president to come to Puerto Rico to review recovery efforts on his own. “I invite the President to stop listening to ignorant and completely wrong advice,” Rosselló said in a statement. “Instead he should come to Puerto Rico to hear firsthand from the people on the ground. I invite him to put all of the resources at his disposal to help Americans in Puerto Rico, like he did for Texas and Alabama. No more, no less.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Trump was questioning whether the money was being spent in the best possible manner. “I have nothing against helping the people of Puerto Rico, but we have got to spend the money wisely,” he told CNN. Sen. Marco Rubio (F-Fla.) told CNN that while there should be an “accounting for how money is spent … Puerto Rico certainly has needs that were different from some of these other places.” He noted that Puerto Rico was already suffering financially when Maria hit, swamping roads, knocking out power to the island and eventually leaving nearly 3,000 dead in its wake. “Mr. President: Enough with the insults and demeaning mischaracterizations. We are not your political adversaries; we are your citizens,” Rosselló said in the statement. “We are not asking for anything more than any other US state has received. We are merely asking for equality.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/03/27/puerto-rico-governor-trump-still-has-it-wrong-about-hurricane-maria-recovery/,New York Post,Conservative
91,Puerto Rico lures tech developers as hurricane season looms,Associated Press,2019-03-21,"PUERTO RICO — In the dark and isolating days after Hurricane Maria, people across Puerto Rico invented new ways to communicate: Elderly couples in need of food or water would raise a flag at their home. Neighbors created amateur security systems, banging on pots for a minute each night to mark the start of a curfew after which any human noise would be considered a call for help. With telephone service blown away by the Category 4 hurricane, the governor took to the only radio station still operating and asked listeners to tell the mayors of all 78 municipalities to drive to the capital and update authorities about their needs in person. Access to devastated areas was impossible, and police, firefighters and emergency responders were unable to talk to each other for days. “The biggest crisis after Maria was communication,” said Nazario Lugo, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Emergency Managers. “That unleashed an endless number of problems.” Now several groups of young tech developers are trying to prevent that from happening the next time a major disaster strikes. They are roaming Puerto Rico with laptops, transmitters and drones to test new systems that could help survivors communicate with authorities and speed up response times to minimize the number of deaths. Puerto Rico is considered an ideal site to test and refine these inventions due to the Sept. 20, 2017, storm and its aftermath that claimed an estimated 2,975 lives. Technology is also lagging on an island where police and firefighters lack an interoperable system to communicate with each other. One team of developers backed by IBM is sticking transmitters to trees with Velcro as part of a hardware and software system they invented called Project OWL, which stands for Organization, Whereabouts, and Logistics. It won a $200,000 prize at a Call for Code competition late last year in which 100,000 developers from 156 nations participated — an event focused on natural disaster preparedness and relief. “We were thinking, ‘How can we make this in a way so stupidly simple to be used that you don’t even have to think about it?’” said Project OWL team leader Bryan Knouse. “It’s really hard to tell people who have been through a disaster, ‘Download this app’ or ‘Go to this website.’ Not gonna happen.” The tiny transmitter boxes emit a low-frequency Wi-Fi connection that users can link to via smartphones. Once connected, a pop-up box in English and Spanish automatically appears and people can enter information including name, location, number of pets, medical needs and hazards such as fallen trees, downed power lines, fires or blocked roads. The information is relayed back through the network and eventually to emergency officials. The team recently made its first large-area test of the system in the northwest coastal town of Isabela. One group got into a car and stopped repeatedly to affix transmitters around a 1-square-mile area while another group led by Knouse stayed at the home base, which that day was the roof of a barbecue joint that provided enough height to collect the signals. Further boosting the signal were two large cream-colored balloons bought at Party City fitted with a transmitter. The transmitters are powered by batteries and maybe eventually solar power, and the team envisions the system working in places from the US mainland to India to Japan. Every couple of minutes, Knouse’s computer dinged with messages that included names, location and details of the roving group that popped up on a map with messages such as “Help me please!” and “NEED WATER!!!” The team later met with members of a local Boys and Girls Club to introduce the technology to young users in hopes they could teach it to and share it with their neighbors. Isabela’s mayor, Carlos Delgado, said he was impressed by the project and wishes it was invented before Maria shredded the island’s telecommunications system. He lamented how city officials had to walk to dozens of neighborhoods to learn about people’s needs after the hurricane, which delayed the delivery of food, water and medicine. “It was a bit like going back to the start of humanity: Everything was done on foot,” he said. Another project is led by Pedro Cruz, a self-taught Puerto Rican tech developer who recently won a local hackathon with a project called DroneAid. He recalled seeing messages such as “SOS” and “WE NEED FOOD” scrawled in big letters on roads so they could be seen from the air after Maria. He envisions before a storm giving people 5-foot-long mats with standardized symbols indicating needs — such as food, water or medical care — that could be spread out on flat surfaces. Programmed drones could fly overhead, read the symbols and process them into data about needs and locations for emergency responders. The idea came to him when he was physically unable to reach his grandmother after Maria. He could not communicate with her and worried about her respiratory and heart conditions. So he flew his drone to her house, and she waved through the window. “She heard the drone and knew it was me,” Cruz said, adding that his grandmother died two months after Maria from respiratory and cardiac failure at an intensive care unit in a hospital hit by frequent blackouts. As he continued to fly his drone across Puerto Rico in the days and weeks after Maria, he noticed that sometimes food and water were being delivered to neighborhoods that already had been supplied, while others went begging: “There were a lot of duplicated efforts.” He said his system might help avoid that. Other tech companies have jumped at the opportunity to provide connectivity in the storm’s aftermath, including Google, which obtained an experimental license from the US Federal Communications Commission to provide emergency cellular service through Loon balloons. The project helped connect more than 200,000 people and began winding down in March 2018. However, Lugo, a former emergency management director for Puerto Rico, warned the US territory still needs to strengthen and update its communications system before the hurricane season starts on June 1. He also stressed that authorities should allow regular citizens and amateur radio operators to participate in that system. “Communication should not be restricted,” he said, adding that the government needs to embrace new technology. “We’re still far behind.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/03/21/puerto-rico-lures-tech-developers-as-hurricane-season-looms/,New York Post,Conservative

93,Video shows Norwegian cruise ship destroy dock in Puerto Rico,Joshua Rhett Miller,2019-02-14,"That shore looked bad! A Norwegian cruise ship slammed into a pier in Puerto Rico, destroying two mooring points amid high winds on Tuesday, video shows. A 75-second clip posted online shows the 4,100-passenger Norwegian Epic nearing the Port of San Juan as a local pilot attempted to safely guide the vessel with the help of two tugboats. But the pilot lost control when “prevailing winds” pushed the 1,081-foot ship into the mooring points as startled guests watched from nearby balconies, according to the footage. “It seems like we’re gonna hit,” one man says in the clip. “Yeah, we’re not supposed to do that. That’s not good. Yeah, we just crashed into the pier.” In another video posted on Twitter, the ship is seen lurching toward one mooring point before sinking the structure. A man can be heard screaming in the background just after another man said, “That’s gonna hit.” The ship then continues toward the pier, crashing into a second mooring point and a walkway connecting it to land. Both of the structures then disappear into the water. No injuries were reported after the incident, but guests were ordered to disembark the ship sooner than previously expected, Norwegian tweeted on Tuesday. “We are working closely with local authorities to assess the damage,” the company announced. Photos later posted on Twitter showed a deep gash to the ship’s hull. “It should buff out pretty easy right,” passenger Cody Pennington tweeted. “I’m onboard & it’s been one crazy ride. Some passengers were asked about ending their trip early & just flying back to the states from PR.” The ship, which is based in Florida’s Port Canaveral, had minimal and superficial damage to its hull, Norwegian told the Orlando Sentinel. The wild crash occurred after a mechanical failure earlier in the week, which led to the vessel losing power at sea and skipping two scheduled port stops in Tortola and St. Thomas. The Epic is expected to return to Florida on Saturday, the Sentinel reported.

94,Elizabeth Warren reportedly planning trip to Puerto Rico,Joe Tacopino,2019-01-17,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is planning a visit to Puerto Rico next week amid speculation that the Trump administration may divert hurricane relief funds to build a Mexican border wall, a report said. Warren, who announced a bid for the presidency on New Year’s Eve, will hold an event in San Juan on Tuesday, according to CNN. The trip comes amid a government shutdown over President Trump’s request for $5.7 billion for a wall across the US southern border. Trump has looked to other possible avenues of funding for the wall — including using disaster relief slated for Puerto Rico, Texas, California and Florida, according to CNN. Warren has been vocal about her opposition to that proposal. “Mexico won’t pay for @realDonaldTrump’s stupid wall, and neither will Congress,” Warren tweeted last week. “So now, he’s considering using dollars that were supposed to go to disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, TX, CA & elsewhere to fund his political stunt. Unacceptable.” ",https://nypost.com/2019/01/17/elizabeth-warren-reportedly-planning-trip-to-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
64,New footage shows Dems at swanky 'cocktail reception' in Puerto Rico amid government shutdown,Lukas Mikelionis   ,2019-01-16,"New footage has emerged of congressional Democrats enjoying a swanky cocktail party in Puerto Rico in the midst of the partial government shutdown.The oddly timed trip was first reported over the weekend. But footage obtained by Fox News gives a behind-the-scenes look at one of the island soirees, where at least three California Democrats can be seen gabbing with guests at the Sereno Sand Patio at La Concha Hotel, in San Juan.Reps. Gil Cisneros, Pete Aguilar, and Mike Levin were filmed at the party organized by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC and heavily attended by lobbyists. The evening event was billed as a “cocktail reception and dinner.”The trip took place at a fancy seaside resort with rooms costing more than $400 a night. The congressmen also planned to see a special performance of the hit Broadway show “Hamilton,” though they had to buy the tickets themselves.The memo on the trip to Puerto Rico named over 100 lobbyists and corporate executives, some from Washington firms, R.J. Reynolds, Facebook, Comcast, Amazon, PhRMA, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, and unions like the National Education Association.The offices of Cisneros, Aguilar, or Levin did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.More than 30 Democratic members of Congress who traveled to Puerto Rico were called out by Republicans and President Trump, who criticized the timing of the trip.“I’ve been here all weekend,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of the Democrats were in Puerto Rico celebrating something. I don’t know, maybe they’re celebrating the shutdown.”“We have a very big crisis, a humanitarian crisis on the border. Everybody knows it, they know it.""Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also criticized the Democrats, saying they “are so alarmed about federal workers not getting paid they’re partying on the beach instead of negotiating a compromise to reopen the government and secure the border.”Republican rising-star Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas questioned the timing of the trip.“It sounds like they had a lot of fun. They've also been talking a lot about the plight that federal workers see themselves in,"" Crenshaw said on “The Story”. “They're not wrong about that, but if we're gonna talk about that then I don't know if these excursions to Puerto Rico are really the right way to handle that. We should be negotiating.”Trump, meanwhile, has been roundly blamed by Democrats for the shutdown. They fault him for insisting on billions for a border wall, and have urged him to support bills opening the government to no avail.The BOLD PAC has been largely mum on which Democrats attended the trip, but it has since emerged that New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, were also present. The participation of Aguilar and Cisneros wasn’t previously reported.A picture of Menendez on the beach particularly irked the senator, who lashed out against Fox News for publishing it.“You could have had hours and hours and hours of meetings, and you chose one thing for an hour,"" Menendez said of the shirtless beach picture that made the rounds.Some Democrats also defended the trip. Bold PAC Chair and Rep. Tony Cardenas promised that the trip wouldn't interfere with their responsibilities, saying at the time of the trip that they would closely monitor the situation in Washington. “If there is any progress by Senate Republicans or the White House to reopen the federal government, then we will act accordingly,” he said in a statement.Henry R. Muñoz, the finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) told the Washington Post that the criticism over the trip was “insulting.”“Nobody would get angry if 30 Congress members went to Kansas, or to Arkansas, or to Texas,” he said. “It’s insulting, and there’s an accent on the insult.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congressional-dems-attended-swanky-cocktail-reception-in-puerto-rico-amid-government-shutdown,Fox,Conservative

95,"Trump may use Puerto Rico, California disaster funds to build border wall",Max Jaeger,2019-01-10,"President Trump has been briefed about using disaster-relief money meant to help storm-soaked Puerto Rico and fire-ravaged California to build his border wall, according to a report. If Trump declares a national emergency, he could dip into a $13.9 billion Army Corps of Engineers fund intended for public works, NBC reported. Of that money, $2.5 billion is allocated for ongoing recovery from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and $2.4 billion is set aside to improve infrastructure along the the Yuba River Basin in California. Defense Department officials discussed the plan with Trump Thursday as he traveled to the southern border. Trump needs $5.7 billion to build the long-promised wall along the nation’s southern border. Twenty days ago, parts of the federal government were shut as part of his ongoing feud with Democrats, who are blocking funding for the border wall with Mexico. Officials told Trump the Army Corps could put up 315 miles of 30-foot, bollard-style barrier in 18 months, according to NBC, which cited sources. But siphoning off money for disaster relief and mitigation will put American lives at risk, a Congressional staffer told the outlet. “Hundreds of thousands of people will be at risk if there is a strong or wet winter in these flood areas and the protection projects haven’t been completed,” the staffer said.

66,Report: Maria had $43B impact on Puerto Rico's economy,,2018-12-03," A report from Puerto Rico's government says Hurricane Maria had a $43 billion impact on the U.S. territory's economy, $1 billion more than originally estimated.The Puerto Rico Planning Board's report says its calculations took into account millions of dollars received so far in federal hurricane recovery funds and insurance money.Overall, the board found that the capital of San Juan was among the six most affected cities on the island after the Category 4 storm hit in September 2017, causing more than an estimated $100 billion in damage.""Given the magnitude of the natural disaster, the economic sectors will keep feeling the impact for an undetermined amount of time,"" the report says.The board said it came up with the $43 billion figure in part via questionnaires issued to the public and private sectors as well as statistics provided by professional associations through October.Puerto Rico economist Jose Caraballo said in a phone interview Monday that federal aid and insurance payouts so far have covered only 24 percent of the losses reported.""A lot remains to be done,"" he said. ""The economic impact of the reconstruction has not been felt.""The government said losses for the private sector alone totaled $30 billion, with manufacturing reporting the highest loss of income and agriculture among the highest damage to infrastructure and equipment.The report comes as Puerto Rico struggles to emerge from a 12-year-old recession and tries to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt.As the economic crisis continues, Puerto Rico's governor and a federal control board overseeing the island's finances continue to clash.On Monday, the board accused Gov. Ricardo Rossello of signing three executive orders related to increasing employee compensation or benefits without its approval. It also said Rossello has enacted nearly 100 laws without following required protocol.

67,Puerto Rico approves laws for insurance holders post-Maria,,2018-11-27," The governor of Puerto Rico overhauled the U.S. territory's insurance laws on Tuesday to help protect policy holders as thousands of claims remain unresolved more than a year after Hurricane Maria.Gov. Ricardo Rossello signed six laws into effect as he stressed that his administration was not pleased with how insurance companies handled complaints filed after the Category 4 storm hit.One law now requires insurance companies to start making partial payments under certain conditions shortly after a state of emergency is declared. Another creates special courtrooms with expert judges to solve appraisal disagreements via mediation, a first for Puerto Rico. All decisions reached during mediation will be binding but can be appealed in court. A third law sharpens the types of actions officials can take against insurance companies if they do not resolve cases promptly or act improperly.""This is a historic moment,"" Javier Rivera, who oversees the Office of the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico, said in a phone interview. ""It transforms how insurance companies will respond in a catastrophic event.""Another law will for the first time create micro insurance to help low-income people on an island of 3.3 million inhabitants with a poverty rate of nearly 45 percent. Additional new laws required that each insurance company have a written emergency response plan that has to be certified annually by the government, and that a company pay the cost of an audit if it's required. A final law states that qualifying businesses can use surplus line insurers if at least three other companies decline partial or full cover.""This...will result in considerable savings to our policyholders, who in many cases have seen unsustainable increases in their premiums,"" Rossello said.Hurricane Maria caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage when it hit on Sept. 20, 2017, destroying Puerto Rico's power grid and forcing businesses to remain closed for months. Overall, it was the most expensive catastrophe for the insurance industry last year, with losses amounting to $32 billion, higher than Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, according to a report from Swiss Re, a reinsurance company based in Switzerland.More than 287,000 claims were filed, and of those, nearly 11,000 claims representing a total of nearly $2 billion have not been resolved, Rivera said. Insurance companies struggled after the storm, including Real Legacy, which folded. The number of claims that went unanswered or unpaid also prompted the government to file a lawsuit against several companies to prevent them from dropping claims because they have allegedly expired. The lawsuits also seek $2.6 billion in damages for those who have not been compensated.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-approves-laws-for-insurance-holders-post-maria,Fox,Conservative

70,Florida GOP distances from Trump's 'absolute no' on Puerto Rico's statehood comments,Lukas Mikelionis,2018-09-26,"Florida Republicans are distancing themselves from President Trump’s remarks on Monday that he doesn’t favor Puerto Rico becoming the 51st U.S. state.Trump declared “absolute no” on statehood for the island during a radio interview with Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera. He went on to slam Puerto Rico’s “incompetent leadership” and took a swipe at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, whom he said is a “grossly incompetent person” and “a horror show.”“With people like that involved in Puerto Rico, I would be an absolute no,” Trump said. “Puerto Rico shouldn’t be talking about statehood until they get some people that really know what they’re doing.”""With people like that involved in Puerto Rico, I would be an absolute no. Puerto Rico shouldn’t be talking about statehood until they get some people that really know what they’re doing.""TRUMP SAYS US RESPONSE TO PUERTO RICO HURRICANES WAS 'INCREDIBLE, UNSUNG SUCCESS'The comments prompted top Republicans in Florida, who hope to win the support of Puerto Ricans in the state in the upcoming midterm elections, to distance from Trump’s remarks.Gov. Rick Scott tweeted the same day that he supports statehood for Puerto Ricans, saying “the will of the Puerto Rican voters should be respected - and it's clear they have voted in favor of statehood.”According to the recent referendum last year, 97 percent of voters on the island voted to support the statehood, though the legitimacy of the results was called into question as merely 23 percent of people participated in the referendum. The leaders of the Popular Democratic Party, who support the current status as a U.S. territory, urged people to boycott the vote, the Orlando Sentinel reported.FEMA DIRECTOR SAYS THERE'S 'DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIRECT DEATHS AND INDIRECT DEATHS' IN PUERTO RICO, FOLLOWING TRUMP REMARKSAccording to a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey conducted this summer, nearly 50 percent of respondents said they support Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state of the U.S. A quarter of respondents said the island should keep its current status.

Bill Nelson, who’s being challenged by Scott in the upcoming November general election, saying the president is treating Puerto Ricans as “second-class” citizens.Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for the state’s governorship, said on Tuesday that he supports “equality” for Puerto Ricans.PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR RAISES HURRICANE MARIA DEATH TOLL FROM 64 TO 2,975Some Republicans also criticized Trump, saying his comments would make it harder for Republicans as a party to support the statehood option for Puerto Rico.“The Republican Party’s platform [on statehood] is useless if we don’t have a leader that gets behind that,” Peter Vivaldi, a former Republican Florida Senate candidate and local community leader, told the Sentinel. “If we’re not going to be treated equally, are you going to cut ties with Puerto Rico, or what are you going to do?”“You’re holding hostage the territory of Puerto Rico just because you have a Twitter war with a mayor that doesn’t agree with you,” Vivaldi added. “There can’t be conditions.”.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-gop-distances-from-trumps-absolute-no-on-puerto-ricos-statehood-comments,Fox,Conservative
71,"Puerto Rico marks 1 year since Maria with choirs, protests",,2018-09-20," The uplifting strains of one of Puerto Rico's most beloved songs filled the air at 6:15 a.m. on Thursday as a choir stood in the coastal town where Hurricane Maria made landfall at that moment exactly one year ago.The serenade in Yabucoa, a fishing and farming town of 37,000 still struggling to recover from the Category 4 storm, was the first in a series of events to mark the anniversary of the devastating storm and remember the estimated 2,975 people who lost their lives in its aftermath. Protests were planned in San Juan and elsewhere, as well as a funeral procession. Tens of thousands remain without adequate shelter and reliable access to electrical power a year after the hurricane, which caused an estimated $100 billion in damage.While the U.S. government has invested billions of dollars to help clean up and repair the U.S. territory, much work remains. Major power outages are still being reported, tens of thousands of insurance claims are still pending and nearly 60,000 homes still have temporary roofs unable to withstand a Category 1 hurricane.""I think it's inexplicable,"" Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International's secretary general, told The Associated Press during a visit to the island Thursday. ""There's no justifiable reason I can see for this gross level of negligence.""Government officials argue that many changes have been made to better prepare Puerto Rico for future storms, but they acknowledge that significant obstacles remain.Jose Ortiz, director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority, told reporters that 20 percent of repairs made to the power grid need to be redone. He said crews didn't have access to the best materials at the time or were forced to rely on temporary fixes, such as using trees as makeshift power polls after Maria destroyed up to 75 percent of transmission lines.In addition, municipal officials have complained that reconstruction efforts are too slow. Ariel Soto, assistant to the mayor of the mountain town of Morovis, said that 220 families there remain without a proper roof.""We're still waiting for help,"" he said. ""This hit us hard.""In Yabucoa, tarps still covered many homes that have yet to be rebuilt even as the hopeful strains of ""Amanecer Borincano"" — ""Puerto Rican Dawn"" — resonated at the spot where Maria first unleashed its fury. ""I am the light of the morning that illuminates new paths,"" the choir sang to the dozens of local officials and residents gathered there. ""I am the son of palm trees, of fields and rivers.""In the capital, San Juan, among those still living under a blue tarp during the peak of hurricane season was Sixta Gladys Pena, a 72-year-old community leader.""You worry, because you think it's going to fly off like it did before,"" she said. ""We've lost an entire year and nothing has been resolved. You feel powerless.""Puerto Ricans also have become increasingly angry and frustrated as President Donald Trump recently touted what he said was a ""fantastic"" response to Hurricane Maria, calling it an ""unsung success"" as he denied the official death toll without presenting any evidence.Nivia Rodriguez, a 60-year-old retiree whose uncle died a week after the storm, said she grew upset after watching videos of rescue crews in North Carolina when Hurricane Florence hit.""They saved five dogs that were drowning,"" she said, adding that she feels Puerto Rico didn't get the same treatment. ""That hits you.""Like many, Rodriguez hoped that after Thursday, she would no longer be bombarded by photos and videos that make her feel like she's reliving Hurricane Maria.""It's too much,"" she said.But others felt that Maria's tragic legacy still needs to be acknowledged, long after the anniversary has passed. Among them was a group of artists unveiling an exhibition called simply, ""6:15 A.M.""Artist Omar Banuchi, who organized the exhibit, said he was reluctant at first, in part because he didn't know how to approach the subject. ""It's something that affected all of us and keeps affecting us,"" he said.He said the exhibition walks a fine line, with some paintings showing beautiful landscapes alongside trailers set up by Puerto Rico's forensics institute as part of the effort to try to identify the bodies of those who perished in the storm. There also will be live music that will incorporate sounds of the hurricane hitting the island.""The point is for people to have a good time,"" Banuchi said.

98,Dems: Trump must apologize for refusing to accept Puerto Rico death toll,Marisa Schultz,2018-09-19,"WASHINGTON – More than 130 Democrats from the House and Senate signed a letter to President Trump demanding he apologize to the people of Puerto Rico for refusing to accept the official death toll for Hurricane Maria. Trump asserted 3,000 people didn’t die and said Democrats were inflating the official death count to make him look bad. “These comments were grossly inaccurate, callous, embarrassing and beneath the dignity of the Office of the President of the United States,” the lawmakers said in the letter. “We call on you to immediately apologize and set the record straight by publicly acknowledging the official death toll.” Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spearheaded the letter, which coincides with the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria making landfall. Of the 132 lawmakers who signed, all were Democrats – expect for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Deaths on the island were unreported, so the government of Puerto Rico commissioned an independent study from George Washington University that determined 2,975 people died because of the effects of Hurricane Maria in the six months after the storm. The government of Puerto Rico accepted the findings. Trump continued to sow death toll doubts as he headed out to survey the damage of Hurricane Florence Wednesday in the Carolinas. He tweeted late Tuesday that “everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence” but at some point “Democrats will start ranting.” The lawmakers panned Trump’s political conspiracy as “highly offensive.” “The lost lives of U.S. citizens are no political stunt, and this is not a partisan matter,” they wrote. Velazquez will join Mayor Bill de Blasio and fellow New York Democratic Reps. Joe Crowley, Grace Meng, Yvette Clarke and Adriano Espaillat Thursday at City Hall to call on the

99,Ocasio-Cortez: Maria response shows Puerto Ricans ‘treated like second-class citizens’,Marisa Schultz,2018-09-16,"WASHINGTON – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the death of her grandfather after Hurricane Maria and thousands of others highlight the “chronic neglect” the US government has shown the people of Puerto Rico. “What we saw in Puerto Rico was a mass death of 3,000 people. It was the worst humanitarian crisis in modern American history and many, many people impacted by this storm point to government inaction as the cause of death,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. The progressive darling said her grandfather died in a medical facility in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm, but didn’t elaborate on the details. “You don’t know whether a hospital lost power,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “My grandfather was in a medical facility and he had passed away in the middle of the night. The people who pass away in these storms are the most vulnerable.” She’s blasted the Trump Administration for not investing in Puerto Rico and for not fighting climate change. “It’s acute situations like this in which Puerto Ricans continue to be treated like second-class citizens,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Puerto Rico was given a fraction of the FEMA recovery as Houston, for example, in Hurricane Harvey.” President Trump has praised his response to Hurricane Maria as an “unsung success.” He denied the death toll of nearly 3,000 lives lost directly and indirectly in the storm and suggested they were made up numbers. The government of Puerto Rico has accepted the new death toll after commissioning a study by George Washington University. On Sunday, Trump’s FEMA Administrator Brock Long declined to endorse the updated 3,000 death tally and echoed his boss’s skepticism. “There’s a lot of issues with numbers being all over the place. It’s hard to tell what’s accurate and what’s not,” Long told “Fox News Sunday.” Ocasio-Cortez beat longtime Rep. Joe Crowley (D-Queens) in an upset primary win in June by campaigning on a progressive agenda, such as Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee and tuition-free public college. CNN’s Jake Tapper pressed Ocasio-Cortez on how she would pay for the giveaways that are estimated to cost at least $40 trillion. The 28-year-old declined to say where the money would come from but insisted they are not “pie in the sky” ideas. “Medicare for all would save the American people a very large amount of money … these are generational investments,” she said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s win as a “fluke” after he trounced her favored candidate, Cynthia Nixon, in the gubernatorial primary on Thursday. Ocasio-Cortez said she was most focused Thursday not on Nixon, but on electing local candidates with a progressive agenda. “Every single down ballot progressive candidate in my district – New York 14 – won,” she said of her Queens and Bronx district. “New York had a profound tidal change, really, in the Democratic Party.” Also Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh shouldn’t get a vote in the Senate until an anonymous sexual misconduct allegation against him is investigated. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) revealed Thursday she referred the complaint to the FBI, though the unnamed woman first stepped forward in July. The woman alleges more than 30 years ago when she and Kavanaugh were both in high school he held her down at a party and tried to force himself on her. Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct then or at any time in of his life. “What is going right now is there is not due process and we’re looking at brushing a potentially and extremely concerning incident under the rug,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Democrats didn’t raise the allegation during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to vote on his nomination on Thursday.

He went down there, he did what he did. I hate talking about politics and all that, but I think this is more than politics,” Cora said. “This is about a country that really suffered, we still, you see the hurricanes forming now. Everybody’s panicking. It’s not easy.”The Red Sox manager pointed out how his team, and other Major League Baseball clubs, helped in the relief efforts, and acknowledged that conditions in Puerto Rico are improving every day.“We’re better than yesterday. We keep getting better,” he said. “And it’s just a matter of time for us to be that enchanted island, like back in the day.”Cora's comments came as the U.S. braces for Hurricane Florence, which is expected to cause heavy damage as it slams into the Carolinas this week.Earlier Thursday, Trump sparked controversy when he addressed his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria, the Category 4 storm that devastated Puerto Rico last September.""When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000,"" Trump tweeted.He added: ""This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.""George Washington University, which released the study that estimated 2,975 died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, said Thursday that the school stood by the study and was “confident” of the number's accuracy.“This study, commissioned by the Government of Puerto Rico, was carried out with complete independence and freedom from any kind of interference,” the university said in a statement.

72,A look at Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria,,2018-09-14," In the days after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as the most destructive storm in the modern history of the island, a poll by a U.S. market research company added insult to injury. The Morning Consult survey found that nearly half of adults in the U.S. didn't know people born in the territory, which is about 1,200 miles southeast of Florida, are American citizens by birth.But a lack of knowledge about Puerto Rico predates the storm.Here is a look at the history and key issues facing the island:THE BEGINNINGThe U.S. has had a fraught relationship with the island since the late 19th century. Spain ceded it to the U.S in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, and Congress declared it an ""unincorporated"" territory in 1917 in an act that granted U.S. citizenship to people born in Puerto Rico. At the outset, the island functioned much like a colony, with Congress allowed to overrule any local legislation and the president given power to appoint a governor. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the U.S. authorized the island to elect its own governor and draft a constitution. In 1952, it was re-christened the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and a semi-autonomous relationship was codified, establishing that the U.S. has jurisdiction over national matters such as trade and foreign relations while the island's bi-cameral legislature and governor have control over local matters.ITS STATUSThroughout this history, the people of Puerto Rico have been split over whether they want independence, statehood or some form of the semi-autonomous relationship. The debate over the island's ""status"" is the central feature of its politics and divides its major political parties.The federal government has long said that it would accept a change in the status of the Puerto Rico if the people of the island clearly supported the decision. But for decades, they have been divided between those who favor statehood and those who want to maintain the commonwealth, perhaps with some changes. A small minority continue to favor independence.The last referendum, in 2017, strongly favored statehood but opponents questioned the validity of the vote because of low turnout.The hitch is that any change would have to be approved by Congress. Statehood legislation, with support from Republicans and Democrats, was introduced in June but appears unlikely to gain momentum as politicians remain hesitant to take up such a thorny issue.SEMI-AUTONOMY IN PRACTICEBoth Spanish and English are official languages on the island, but the former is more widely spoken. Puerto Ricans often refer to their island as ""el pais,"" the Spanish word for country. Puerto Rico fields its own Olympic team and has its own cultural identity.But Puerto Ricans can fly back and forth from the mainland without showing their U.S. passports. The more than 5 million people of Puerto Rican descent on the mainland outnumber the 3.3 million on the island. Puerto Ricans also serve in the U.S. military and many, if not most, consider themselves as American as anyone else in the country.They do have, however, second-class political status. Residents of the island cannot cast a ballot in the U.S. presidential election, have no representatives in the Senate, and send only a non-voting member to the U.S. House of Representatives. While they don't pay U.S. personal income tax, they still must contribute for Medicare and Social Security and pay income taxes to the Puerto Rican government.DEBT CRISISThe U.S. federal government is now exerting an increased level of financial control over the island because of its debt crisis.Financial turmoil is the result of massive borrowing to cover deficits over a decade-long economic recession sparked by the expiration of a manufacturing tax credit. Congress created a financial oversight board in 2016 in exchange for granting Puerto Rico a legal mechanism to restructure public debt that had spiraled to more than $70 billion.But that proved deeply unpopular on the island, where the board's insistence on budget and benefit cuts prompted fierce protests.HURRICANE MARIAHurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a category 4 storm on Sept. 20, 2017. It bashed the island for 12 hours, destroying the electric power grid and thousands of homes, businesses and government buildings. Puerto Ricans were also left with no power and water, no cell phone service, and a sense that the U.S. government had been ill-prepared for the disaster — which the Federal Emergency Management Agency later conceded was true.Regardless of the relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the storm is proving to be an expensive disaster for all American taxpayers. The federal government says it has already spent more than $3 billion for recovery efforts. The government of Puerto Rico says the total cost of recovery over the next decade will be more than $100 billion, and it says it will need help from Congress to foot that bill.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/a-look-at-puerto-rico-before-and-after-hurricane-maria,Fox,Conservative
101,Trump rejects Puerto Rico hurricane death toll,Lia Eustachewich,2018-09-13,"President Trump on Thursday roundly denied that nearly 3,000 people died when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico – and accused Democrats of fudging the death toll to “make me look as bad as possible.” “3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths,” he tweeted. “As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000…” In a follow-up tweet, he continued, “…..This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.” Trump’s comments directly contradict a report commissioned by island officials that found that 2,975 people died because of the disaster. Initially, only 64 people were believed to have perished when Maria swept over the US island territory last September — a couple weeks after it was battered by Hurricane Irma. But that total ballooned in the report, conducted by George Washington University researchers, which calculated deaths that occurred between September 2017 and February 2018. The report took into account deaths in the storm’s aftermath due to lack of electricity, clean water and access to medical care. Trump said that unrelated deaths were added to inflate the number. “If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!” he wrote. Trump’s tweets sparked a livid response from San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who called him a “bully” before unleashing a series of angry tweets. “Simply put: delusional, paranoid, and unhinged from any sense of reality,” Cruz wrote. “Trump is so vain he thinks this is about him. NO IT IS NOT.” She added, “Damn it: this is NOT about politics this was always about SAVING LIVES.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said he wouldn’t challenge the new numbers — but also refused to lay blame for them. “Casualties don’t make a person look bad, so I have no reason to dispute these numbers,” Ryan told reporters. “It’s an isolated island that lost its infrastructure and power for a long time.” Asked whether he was disturbed by Trump’s tweets, Ryan deflected. “I’ll just say what I just said, which is there is no reason to dispute these numbers,” he reiterated. “This is a devastating storm that hit an isolated island. And that’s really no one’s fault. It’s just what happened.” But Ron DeSantis, the Trump-backed GOP gubernatorial candidate in Florida, lashed out against the president’s comments. “Ron DeSantis is committed to standing with the Puerto Rican community, especially after such a tragic loss of life,” his team said in a statement. “He doesn’t believe any loss of life has been inflated.” Since the revised death toll, Trump has continuously praised his administration – and himself – for doing a “fantastic job” in responding to the hurricane. He doubled down on those comments this week ahead of Hurricane Florence, which is set to pummel the Carolinas later Thursday. “We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan),” Trump wrote on Twitter. “We are ready for the big one that is coming!” But the federal response to Maria has drawn sharp criticism for being too slow and woefully underprepared. The Category 4 storm devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure, leaving its nearly 3.4 million resident without power for weeks and knocking out 95 percent of cellphone towers. Electricity was restored to all residents just last month, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. In its own report, the Federal Emergency Management Agency admitted it underestimated how many supplies were needed and how hard it’d be to get them to the island. Meanwhile, a huge stockpile of water bottles meant for Maria victims were recently discovered sitting at a Puerto Rico airport. FEMA said the supplies were brought to the island and turned over to the “central government” — but it’s unclear why they were never distributed. Hurricane Maria is estimated to have caused $100 billion in damage when it hit on Sept. 20. Shortly after the storm, Trump toured San Juan and told officials that the island was lucky it hadn’t faced “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina — while praising that only “16 people versus in the thousands” had died. At least 1,833 people were killed in Katrina. ",https://nypost.com/2018/09/13/trump-rejects-puerto-rico-hurricane-death-toll/,New York Post,Conservative
100,Millions of water bottles left in Puerto Rico were ‘excess’ supplies: FEMA,Tamar Lapin,2018-09-13,"More than 10 million bottles of water left to rot on a Puerto Rican airport tarmac were deemed “excess” supplies that federal officials decided the island didn’t need while recovering from Hurricane Maria, FEMA said on Thursday. The agency said the close to 20,000 pallets of drinking water that could contain as many as 12 million bottles were considered extra in February. “We had provided [water] to every volunteer agency that had a warehouse, every entity… a lot of municipalities had excess water,” said Justo Hernandez, operational coordination division director for FEMA, in a conference call with reporters Thursday. The agency said it also stopped distributing water at that time because “commerce was coming back” to Puerto Rico and officials “didn’t want to injure the economy more than it already was.” But in late April, the local Puerto Rican General Services Administration requested the water bottles from FEMA and began giving them out in May. The local agency handed out about 700 pallets before receiving two complaints that the water smelled and tasted foul. But Hernandez insisted most of the water is drinkable. “I can not assure you that all the water is good,” he said. “Some spoiled.” An investigation was opened two days ago into why the water was requested after it was labeled as excess by FEMA, Hernandez said. The investigation will also assess how the remaining water will be disposed and whether any of it can still be used. The water was originally moved from containers to a runway at the José Aponte de la Torre Airport in Ceiba in January as a cost-saving measure, Marty Bahamonde, director of disaster operations for FEMA’s Office of External Affairs, told CBS News. Prior to the move, the agency had been storing water in 1,100 containers on the island at a cost of about $300,000 a day, Bahamonde said. “FEMA put that water out on that airstrip for the purpose of getting it out of containers, so that there would be no cost to us and no cost to the taxpayer,” he said. “In hindsight, it saved us tens of millions of dollars.” The agency didn’t ship the bottles back to the US for use in future disasters when they were no longer needed because that was “cost prohibitive,” Bahamonde said. “Anytime we waste water, that’s something we try absolutely not to do,” he said. “We will never apologize for erring on the side of having too much of a commodity in a place, because that’s what we’re supposed to do.” ",https://nypost.com/2018/09/13/millions-of-water-bottles-left-in-puerto-rico-were-excess-supplies-fema/,New York Post,Conservative

103,Massive stockpile of bottled water found in Puerto Rico a year after Maria,Tamar Lapin,2018-09-12,"Hundreds of thousands of water bottles meant for victims of Hurricane Maria are still sitting at a Puerto Rico airport — nearly a year after the deadly storm, according to a report. A photo showing the bottles in boxes and covered in a blue tarp on a runway in Ceiba was shared widely on social media Tuesday evening. “Although you don’t believe it… almost a million boxes of water that were never delivered to the villages,” posted Abdiel Santana, a photographer working for a Puerto Rican state police agency who took the pictures. “Is there anyone who can explain this?” FEMA acknowledged to CBS News on Wednesday that the bottles were brought inland in 2017 in the wake of the hurricane and that they were turned over to “central government.” It is unclear where the breakdown that caused the bottles to never be distributed was caused. Celebrity chef José Andrés, who brought a crew of volunteers to help feed victims of Maria in the wake of the storm, called for an “official independent investigation” into what happened to the stash of drinking water. “My teams knew about it but first they will say, ‘no we can not use them,’ months later water was no good for human consumption,” he tweeted. “We were ‘buying’ water because they wouldn’t give it to us.” He didn’t specify who “they” was. The revelation comes as President Trump doubled down on his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria on Wednesday and lashed out at the mayor of San Juan, who has been a critic of the effort, as “incompetent.” The president raised eyebrows Tuesday when he touted the response efforts in a meeting to go over preparations for the potentially devastating Hurricane Florence inching toward the Carolinas. “The job that FEMA and law enforcement and everybody did, working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,” he had said. The death toll in Hurricane Maria is estimated to be nearly 3,000, a steep increase from the initial 64.

102,"Trump touts ‘unappreciated great job’ in Puerto Rico, slams San Juan mayor",Mark Moore,2018-09-12,"President Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria, which slammed into Puerto Rico last year, leaving nearly 3,000 people dead — and lashed out at the mayor of San Juan, who has been a critic of the effort, as “incompetent.” “We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan),” Trump wrote on Twitter. “We are ready for the big one that is coming!” The president raised eyebrows Tuesday when — during an Oval Office meeting to go over preparations for Hurricane Florence, which is barreling toward the East Coast with Category 4 winds — he touted his controversial response to Maria. “I think Puerto Rico was incredibly successful. Puerto Rico was, actually, our toughest one of all because it’s an island, so you just — you can’t truck things onto it. Everything is by boat,” he said during the meeting. “The job that FEMA and law enforcement and everybody did, working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,” he continued. Shortly after Trump’s comments, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz shot back at the president. “Success? Federal response according to Trump in Puerto Rico a success? If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all,” she wrote on Twitter. Cruz blasted Trump last September for not reacting quickly enough after Maria slammed into Puerto Rico and knocked out power on the island, flooded roads, destroyed bridges and left thousands of people stranded. “We are dying here. And I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out the logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles,” she said. “I am begging. I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy.” Puerto Rico’s government last month updated the death toll to 2,975 from an initial estimate of 64. Asked about Trump touting his administration’s efforts in Puerto Rico, Jeff Byard, FEMA’s associate administrator for the Office of Response and Recovery, said the goal with Florence is to prevent any deaths. “Successful response is obviously no one wants any deaths. So that’s the message of the day, we’re saying ‘Get out’ if you’re in an area where you know it’s going to flood,” he said during a hurricane briefing Wednesday.

104,Trump: Response to Puerto Rico hurricane was ‘unsung success’,Bob Fredericks,2018-09-11,"President Trump on Tuesday lauded the feds’ efforts to prepare for Hurricane Florence as it bore down on the US — and boasted at length about his administration’s response after a powerful hurricane slammed Puerto Rico last year. “I think Puerto Rico was incredibly successful,” Trump said from the White House when asked about lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, which slammed the island last September, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths. “I actually think it was one of the best jobs that’s ever been done. Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success.” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz quickly begged to differ on Twitter. ‏”Success? Federal response according to Trump in Puerto Rico a success? If he thinks the death of 3,000 people [was] a success God help us all,” she wrote in one of a series of mocking posts. “Trump simply does not get it. Thus his neglect towards Puerto Rico cost about 3,000 lives. Unfortunately, it seems he will never get it,” she added in another. The president also repeated his earlier statements about the unique challenges that hampered rescue efforts in the US territory — claiming that power on the island was already out before the storm made landfall. “The problem with Puerto Rico is that their electric grid and generating plan was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in bad shape, in bankruptcy, had no money, was largely closed. When the storm hit, they had no electricity before the storm. When the storm hit, it took it out entirely,” he said. The power grid in Puerto Rico had many problems, both financial and technical, but was working prior to the time Maria struck. The president also repeated his earlier statements that because Puerto Rico was an island, rescuers couldn’t drive trucks filled with relief suppllies to devastated residents. “Puerto Rico was actually our toughest one of all because it is an island. You can’t truck things onto it. Everything is by boat. We moved a hospital into Puerto Rico, [a] tremendous military hospital in the form of a ship,” he said. Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, was incredulous. “Success? Federal response according to Trump in Puerto Rico a success?” Cruz tweeted. “If he thinks the death of 3,000 people os [sic] a success God help us all.” Federal states of emergency have been declared for North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia ahead of Florence, freeing up funds for the three states forecast to be hammered the hardest by its roaring winds and driving rain. Nearly 1.5 million people have abandoned their coastal homes because of mandatory evacuation orders in some areas, as the Category 4 hurricane continued to barrel across the Atlantic, its 130-mph winds, 12-foot storm surge and projected 45 inches of rain edging closer by the hour. But those seeking shelter inland may have to go a long way to outrun Florence’s fury. “This is not just a coastal event,” warned National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham. “All you have to do is look up at your ceiling and think about 12 feet” of water from flooding. “That, folks, is extremely life-threatening.” ",https://nypost.com/2018/09/11/trump-response-to-puerto-rico-hurricane-was-unsung-success/,New York Post,Conservative
75,US report criticizes FEMA response to Maria in Puerto Rico,,2018-09-04," A federal report published Tuesday found that staff shortages and a lack of trained personnel slowed the U.S. government response to Hurricane Maria, a storm estimated to have killed nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico.The U.S. Government Accountability Office said 54 percent of federal emergency personnel were not qualified to do the rescue work in October 2017, a month after the Category 4 hurricane hit the U.S. territory. The report also states there were logistical challenges given Puerto Rico's location and noted that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had to assume many of the local government's responsibilities given the loss of power and communications.Christopher Currie, the GAO's director of emergency management issues, said in a phone interview that FEMA was already stretched thin by responding to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, as well as California wildfires.""The response in Florida, Texas and California was about what we planned for,"" he said. ""In Puerto Rico, obviously, it was a much, much different story.""FEMA did not anticipate not having the support of local government officials in Puerto Rico, who he said were still reeling from the hurricane. In addition, the power grid was destroyed, which meant officials did not immediately understand the scale of the damage because there was no communication for almost a week. Hurricane Maria hit on Sept. 20 and is estimated to have caused $100 billion in damage.""Once the scale was understood, that's when FEMA called in the Department of Defense. They said, 'We're overwhelmed. ... We need help,'"" Currie said. ""From a FEMA standpoint, a couple of things happened that they were not anticipating that they probably could have.""The report also said that FEMA lacked enough Spanish-speaking employees, and that some staffers were not physically fit enough to handle the ""extreme or austere"" environment.Currie added that FEMA was already 30 percent understaffed after Hurricane Harvey, and that some personnel were already drained by the storms and fires that hit prior to Maria.""By the time they got to Puerto Rico, they were very tired,"" he said.FEMA said in a statement that the GAO report captures the complexity of last year's disasters, adding that the agency issued its own report in July and has already issued recommendations for improvements. The FEMA report in part found that it underestimated how many supplies were needed in Puerto Rico and how difficult it would be to get those to the U.S. territory after the hurricane.The GAO report states that federal, state and local official also struggled to find temporary housing for those affected by Hurricane Maria. Currently, tens of thousands of people remain without a proper roof at the peak of this year's hurricane season.Currie said the recovery from Hurricane Maria remains a big concern.""There are just a number of huge challenges still to come,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-report-criticizes-fema-response-to-maria-in-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative
105,Trump: We did ‘fantastic’ job with hurricane relief in Puerto Rico,Ruth Brown,2018-08-29,"President Trump said Wednesday he believes his administration “did a fantastic job” responding to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico — a day after the island’s governor raised the disaster’s death toll from 64 to 2,975. “I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico. We’re still helping Puerto Rico. The governor is an excellent guy and he’s really happy with the job we’ve done,” Trump told reporters. “We have put a lot of money and a lot of effort into Puerto Rico. I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we’ve done.” He said the emergency response to Puerto Rico was more difficult than when Texas and Florida were hit with hurricanes around the same time “because it’s an island” — and falsely claimed “their electric plant was dead before the hurricane.” Trump visited Puerto Rico in October last year after the storm, where he infamously said officials should be “very proud” of the 16-person death toll compared with “a real catastrophe, like Katrina.” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello upgraded that count to almost 3,000 based on a report commissioned by island officials and conducted by George Washington University’s Milken Institute of Public Health. The death toll for Hurricane Katrina, which battered the Gulf Coast in 2005, was more than 1,800.

106,"Nearly 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico linked to Hurricane Maria",Bob Fredericks,2018-08-28,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Tuesday raised the official death toll from Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975 following the release of a new study that said the previous death toll was woefully inaccurate. “We never anticipated a scenario of zero communication, zero energy, zero highway access,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello said, Fox News reported. “I think the lesson is to anticipate the worst.” The Puerto Rican government had been waiting for the new estimate, contained in a report commissioned by island officials and conducted by George Washington University’s Milken Institute of Public Health. “We’re hopeful that this number would become the official number,” said Lynn Goldman, the Institute’s dean, during a briefing with reporters earlier Tuesday. According to the report, the number of excess deaths, which took place between September 2017 to February 2018, was 2,975, a 22 percent increase from what would normally have been expected during that period of time. The study said that the risk of dying over this period was 60 percent higher among people living in the poorest areas, the network reported. Researchers also said that the heightened risk of death continued beyond the five months that researchers studied. “We still don’t know when deaths came back to baseline,” Goldman said. This report was the first phase of what the university expects to be a two-part investigation. In the second phase, researchers plan to interview families of victims who died during Maria’s aftermath to identify how many of the 2,975 deaths could be attributed to the hurricane. By comparison, 1,836 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Katrina, which slammed New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in August 2005. The Trump administration and FEMA came under attack for what critics called an anemic response to the storm. President Trump slammed officials of the US territory and the island’s people, who are US citizens. “Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.,” he said in a tweet.

Ricardo Rossello responded to the study by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University by officially raising the toll.The number is more than double the government's previous estimated death toll of 1,400.""We never anticipated a scenario of zero communication, zero energy, zero highway access,"" Rossello said. ""I think the lesson is to anticipate the worst.""A previous study led by a team of Harvard scientists found that more than 4,600 people were killed in the devastation, dismissing the initial toll of 64 as a ""substantial underestimate.""BBC REPORTER COVERING HAWAII HURRICANE HIT BY FALLING TREE DURING LIVE REPORT: 'THAT WAS UNEXPECTED'Rossello said he's forming a commission to study the response to the storm. He said a registry of vulnerable people will also be created prior to any future hurricanes.There's no national standard for how to calculate disaster-related deaths. While the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports only direct deaths, such as those caused by flying debris or drowning, some local governments may include indirect deaths from things as heart attacks and house fires.Researchers with George Washington said they counted deaths over the span of six months — a much longer period than usual — because so many people were without power during that time.The number of dead has political implications for the Trump administration, which was accused of responding half-heartedly to the disaster. Shortly after the storm, when the official death toll stood at 16, President Trump marveled over the small loss of life compared to that of ""a real catastrophe like Katrina.""HURRICANE LANE CREATED A STEAMY WHITE-OUT AT HAWAII'S KILAUEU VOLCANOHurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans in 2005, was directly responsible for about 1,200 deaths, according to the NHC.

108,Mets coach has special reason to cheer on Puerto Rico,Howie Kussoy,2018-08-20,"WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — Little Leaguer after Little Leaguer met major leaguer after major leaguer at BB&T Ballpark at Bowman Field, soaking up moments that will become some of the greatest memories of their lives. Mets bullpen coach Ricky Bones felt the same way while meeting with Puerto Rico’s Little League team, amazed that his small town of Guayama was representing the Caribbean, with a chance to be crowned world champions. “It’s a town with 41,000 people making it all the way here to the Little League World Series, it’s crazy,” Bones said. “It’s such a thrill. It’s such a cool experience. I think I’m more excited than them.” Before the Mets defeated the Phillies 8-2 Sunday night — and before Puerto Rico faced La Chorrea, Panama, on Monday afternoon — Bones met with the team, who knew of his 11-year major league career. As a Little Leaguer in 1981, Bones helped his hometown to the Caribbean regional in Mexico, but fell short of Williamsport, under coach Efrain Texidor. Now, Texidor’s son, Carlos — an assistant on Bones’ Little League team — is the coach of Guayama. “We kept in touch over the years, and I feel like I’m part of their family because they helped me out so much in my youth,” Bones said. “It’s pretty cool to still see him helping so many kids, and do what he’s been doing for so many years.” The timing of this run makes it even more meaningful to Puerto Rico, following Hurricane Maria in September. “It’s something that Puerto Rico, and they, need,” Bones said. “Puerto Rico went through a lot with the hurricane, so this is like a spiritual lift. “They’re amazed that they’re here. I told them this is a fun game. You have to dedicate yourself, but you have to enjoy it, and you could end up in the majors, too.” David Wright picked up his first hits of his rehab stint, going 2-for-3 (two singles) with a run scored in Sunday’s game with Single-A St. Lucie, while playing five innings at third base.Wright had gone 0-for-14, with two walks, in his first five rehab games. Jay Bruce went 2-for-5 (two singles) as the DH, and is now batting .222 (4-for-18) with a walk in five rehab games. Since picking up just two wins in his first 17 starts of the season, Zack Wheeler (8-6) has earned six wins over his past six starts entering Monday night’s home outing against the Giants. During the career-best stretch, the right-hander has posted a 2.04 ERA, and thrown at least seven innings in four of the six starts, while lowering his season ERA to 3.75.

107,Poor Little Leaguer offers unwitting reminder to wear a cup,Anthony Barstow,2018-08-20,"Little League, big league or beer league — that hurts. Puerto Rico’s Angel Vazquez was looking to bunt against Panama pitcher Arod McKenzie in the fifth inning of their elimination game Monday at the Little League World Series when he took the first pitch he saw, a 77 mph fastball, to the groin. The video shows Vazquez immediately doubling over in pain and two coaches rushing to his side and calling for additional help. It was not immediately clear whether the second baseman was wearing a protective cup, but according to Little League World Series rules, only the catcher and players who will be warming up the pitcher are required to wear a protective device. Required or not, it seems likely the rest of the team will want to look into it before continuing on. Puerto Rico, representing the Caribbean region, beat Panama of the Latin America region 3-1 to stay alive in the double-elimination tournament, riding a one-hit, 14-strikeout effort by pitcher Roberto Joubert. Yadiel Delgado, who replaced Vazquez after the hit by pitch, went on to score the go-ahead run, keeping Puerto Rico’s feel-good story alive for another day — though in Vazquez’s case, it may take a while to feel good again.

109,"Puerto Rico finally admits Hurricane Maria killed more than 1,400 people",Mark Moore,2018-08-09,"Nearly a year after Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean island, Puerto Rico finally acknowledged that more than 1,400 people were killed in the storm — not the 64 it had included in the official death toll. The admission comes in a report the Puerto Rican government prepared last month and is expected to submit to Congress Thursday requesting $139 billion in aid. “Although the official death count from the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety was initially 64, the toll appears to be much higher,” it said in a part titled “the hurricane had a human cost.” In another section of the report — “Transformation and Innovation in the Wake of Devastation” — it revealed: “According to initial reports, 64 lives were lost. That estimate was later revised to 1,427.” Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said Puerto Rico’s original death toll of 64 was “insulting to our collective intelligence.” “This updated number, while possibly still far too low, is at least an acknowledgment that the consequences of Hurricane Maria were far greater than President Trump and his administration have been willing to admit,” Diaz said in a statement. He called Maria “President Trump’s Katrina.” The Trump administration’s “mediocre response to the storm and its failure throughout the ongoing recovery of Puerto Rico cement that as the President’s legacy to the island.” Rep. Nydia Velazquez said it has been “tragically clear for some time” that the destruction was worth that the death toll suggested and faulted the US government’s reaction to the tragedy. “This news is simply the latest evidence underscoring how inadequate the federal response was to a humanitarian crisis affecting our fellow citizens,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. She said she is pushing legislation that would establish federal standards for death counts following disasters and a “9/11 style” panel to investigate the federal response to the hurricane. The number was first reported by the New York Times. Maria swept over island on Sept. 20, causing extensive flooding and knocking out power.

77,"Puerto Rico: 1,400 died from hurricane but toll still at 64",,2018-08-09," Puerto Rico is estimating in a report to Congress that Hurricane Maria killed more than 1,400 people, though an island official said Thursday that the confirmed toll remains frozen at 64 pending a scientific review due out soon.The government, relying on updated statistics it first reported in June, said in a report to Congress detailing a $139 billion reconstruction plan that there were 1,427 more deaths from September to December 2017 than the average for the same time period over the previous four years.The territory’s government said that the additional deaths resulted from the effects of a storm that led to a “cascading failures” in infrastructure across the island of 3.3 million people.The administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello stopped updating its official death toll months ago and ordered an investigation amid reports that the number was substantially undercounted. Public Safety Department Secretary Hector Pesquera said the new total will reflect the findings of the investigation, which is expected in the coming weeks.The figure of more than 1,400, Pesquera said, “is simple math” based on the number of excess deaths. “This is not the official number of deaths attributable to Hurricane Maria,” he said.Hurricane Maria, which came just two weeks after Hurricane Irma passed near enough to cause damage to the island, knocked out power and water across Puerto Rico and caused widespread flooding that left many sick and elderly people unable to get medical treatment.“The hurricanes’ devastating effects on people’s health and safety cannot be overstated,” the government said in the report seeking assistance from Congress to help rebuild an island that was already struggling from a deep economic crisis at the time of the storm.In the weeks after the storm, Puerto Rican officials said the storm directly caused 64 deaths, many in landslides or flooding. But they have also said that more people likely died due to indirect effects of the powerful storm. “We always anticipated that this number would increase as more official studies were conducted,” Pesquera said.The government commissioned an independent epidemiological study by George Washington University and the Milken Institute of Public Health that is due in coming weeks.The use of the higher death toll in the report to Congress was first reported Thursday by The New York Times.Most of the deaths occurred not in the initial storm on Sept. 20, but in the ensuing days and weeks when the island-wide electricity outage and roads blocked by downed power lines and other debris made it difficult to move around and emergency services were stretched beyond their capabilities.Government agencies have used various methods to count storm deaths over the years, with authorities generally trying to sort them into direct and indirect to include people whose deaths are tied to a natural disaster without necessarily being obviously caused by it.New York Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, has called for legislation that would establish federal standards for death counts after disaster. “It has been tragically clear for some time that the devastation from Irma and Maria was many magnitudes worse than the official death toll suggested,” she said.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/puerto-rico-1400-died-from-hurricane-but-toll-still-at-64,Fox,Conservative
110,Cryptocurrency king is hippie former child actor who loves Steve Bannon,"Neil Strauss, Rolling Stone",2018-07-27,"Twenty-six men and women are seated along four folding tables laid end to end in the ballroom of a former Masonic lodge in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. An eclectic mix, ranging from local charity workers to Silicon Valley investors to cryptocurrency early adopters, they all believe that they’re about to make history. Specifically, they are here to help Brock Pierce – a child actor turned video-game entrepreneur turned crypto titan – give away a billion dollars to charity. Not in a will after his death, but now, in the prime of his life and the peak of his career, at age 37. Just three days earlier, Pierce was listed as number nine on Forbes’ first-ever list of Cryptocurrency’s Wealthiest People, with his net worth estimated as high as $1 billion. The math isn’t hard to do: One billion minus one billion equals … “I’ve committed to giving away everything I have,” Pierce tells the hushed group in his gravelly, resonant voice. He stands five feet four, with dirty-blond hair and a dirtier-blond goatee. He’s wearing a leather satchel slung around his torso and a wide-brimmed black hat with two playing cards – a queen of spades and a queen of hearts – perfectly splayed, in a multicolored band. He’s a Burning Man mash-up of young Indiana Jones, Theon Greyjoy and an itinerant street magician. Or, as John Oliver once put it, a “sleepy, creepy cowboy from the future.” Pierce pauses and corrects himself, explaining that he’s giving away “more than everything I have, based on the markets.” A squall of knowing laughter fills the room. In the days preceding this meeting, the crypto markets either dipped, crashed or corrected, depending on what expert you ask. So, by Pierce’s own estimation, the billion accounts for 100 to 130 percent of his wealth. “That’s no concern of mine,” Pierce continues, “because I don’t need anything.” This statement appears to be valid: In nearly 10 full days together, I rarely saw him sleep in a bed or eat a full meal. He crashed on random couches, in the back seats of cars, on tables at bars. He gave away necklaces, bracelets, food, money, time, tequila, you name it. His wife, Crystal Rose, the CEO of Sensay, a company that builds messaging systems, describes him as a nomad who lives out of a suitcase for weeks at a time. The other reason Pierce is giving away more money than he has is that he’s confident he’ll make it back. “That’s the talent he has,” says Rose, who married Pierce in an online “smart contract” that can be dissolved, changed or renewed annually. “I wouldn’t be surprised at all if in two or three years, or even less, he has the same amount again.” In a world in which seniority is measured by the price you bought your first Bitcoin at, Pierce has been around since less than a penny. He is the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation; co-founder of one of the first blockchain venture funds (Blockchain Capital); co-founder of a prominent crypto advisory firm, DNA; part of the team behind the first-ever ICO (initial coin offering); and a founder of some of cryptocurrency’s biggest coins and tokens, including EOS (currently the fifth-largest crypto-currency) and Tether (the 10th-largest), which is meant to stay stable at the price of a dollar. Bruce Fenton, a crypto economic adviser and leading figure on the scene, describes Pierce as one of the community’s most unsung connectors: “In one way, Brock is this larger-than-life and extremely colorful character. In another way, he’s extremely quiet behind the scenes and doesn’t take a lot of credit for what he’s done. There’s hundreds of millions of revenue out there because Brock was the seed that brought people together. We’re talking about stacks and stacks of people.” All that means very little if you’re not at least waist-deep in this oft-discussed, little-understood crypto world. So here’s another way of thinking about what Pierce is doing: Since its inception, in 2009, when a person (or group of people) using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created and mined the first Bitcoin, cryptocurrency has spawned a $350 billion market that’s attracted millions of investors, entrepreneurs, gamblers, hackers, activists and institutions. Even more significant is the backbone it’s built on: blockchain – an encrypted, decentralized digital ledger accessible to anyone (and controlled by no one) that could change everything that requires a record of it, whether real estate, banking, stocks, marriages, contracts or personal identification. Advocates believe this technology can help solve not just online problems like privacy, cybersecurity and the concentration of power into the hands of half a dozen big tech companies, but global problems like poverty, corruption and financial exclusion. “We are now moving toward the possibility of a separation of bank and state,” says Galia Benartzi, who co-founded Bancor, a platform for the automated exchange of cryptocurrencies. “Money, how we make it and use it, may return to the domain of the people and the discretion of the individual.” “The right way to think about the blockchain is that it’s going to replace the entire internet,” Pierce had said when I first met him in LA, where he owns a “Back to the Future”-style DeLorean with a license plate that reads SATOSHI. “When the internet was first being developed, in the Seventies and Eighties, we didn’t have the computer-processing capability to actually secure the internet. By the time we got the processing ability to implement the necessary cryptography to secure it, the foundation had already been laid. So we just kept building for, like, 30 years. But it’s been fundamentally broken the whole time.” In the future, this blocktopian vision may come to pass, or it may be subverted into a greater consolidation of power by market and government forces. Or it could lead to a dystopian takeover of world financial markets by artificial intelligence. Right now, anything’s possible – and that’s why Brock Pierce matters. For lack of a better term, he has become this world’s first cult leader. Among other things, Pierce is trying to give this decentralized world a new center: Puerto Rico – or, as the crypto community has called it at various times: Crypto Rico, Puerto Crypto, Puertopia and Sol. Pierce leased (and intends to buy) the freemasons’ hall and an abandoned children’s museum, which he’s turning into a community center. He’s also co-founding a bank in Puerto Rico, and plans to open both an eco-resort in the island’s famous surf spot Rincón, and a large cluster of residences in nearby Mayagüez. Why Puerto Rico? The simple answer: It’s a beautiful US territory in the Caribbean that offers large tax incentives to independent investors. The island, of course, is also still trying to recover from the one-two punch of a debt crisis and Hurricane Maria. And Pierce, who is smart enough to know that a bunch of mostly rich white males buying up property in a tax haven has a colonialist stench to it, has promised to harness their energy and money to serve Puerto Rico. “We’re going to rebuild Puerto Rico with money that we saved from the IRS in a Robin Hood fashion,” he says with a smirk. One of the people helping is Maria C. Sanchez, who runs TOPS, an after-school art program. Pierce met her in Miami last year, and urged her to come to Puerto Rico to open schools and launch her program. She was on a plane the next day. “I told him one day while we were all watching a sunrise, ‘You are like the Jesus Christ of the 21st century,’” she says of Pierce. “He’s just magical, and I’m nothing but thankful to him and how much he ignites my dreams.” Few conversations with Pierce don’t include a pitch on the advantages of moving to Puerto Rico. While I was with him, three people who’d traveled to visit him that week with no intention of moving ended up renting apartments in San Juan, getting driver’s licenses and taking the plunge. A few weeks afterward, during Pierce’s first-ever Restart Week, a back-to-back confluence of three different crypto conferences in Puerto Rico, he tells me excitedly that hundreds more are following. “This is where you’re going to bring your wife and kids and build the new New World,” he encourages me more than once before going on to say that his mother, brother, wife, ex-girlfriend and nine-year-old daughter are all supposedly moving there – and his dad is considering it. “Always be the pied piper,” Pierce says with a knowing smile as he walks down the streets of Old San Juan, blasting a trance remix of the Charlie Chaplin speech from “The Great Dictator” on a portable pill-shaped Bluetooth speaker. He plays the song for nearly everyone who comes out to meet him, encouraging them to listen to the entire speech, which doubles as a credo of sorts for Pierce: “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone.” Pierce just may be the richest person in the world with no barrier to entry. Everyone is welcome to join the party, which is one of the reasons everyone likes to be around him. It’s never dull; there are always new, like-minded people to meet; and maybe, one of those folks will make them rich (or richer). To help things run smoothly, a small retinue of equally accomplished and hard-partying associates follows him around, telling the dozens of people he’s promised to meet on any given day where he can be found. The Pierce train today includes Eric Greenberg, a former internet consultant who was worth more than $1 billion during the dot-com bubble, and Derek Rundell, who runs a venture-capital firm with Google’s Eric Schmidt. As a result of this trip, Rundell’s venture fund, TomorrowBC, will announce a $50 million collaboration with the company Pierce co-founded, Block.one. To spend time with Pierce is to experience a new form of doing business. He very rarely goes to an office, conference room or anything one typically associates with work. His satchel is filled with small containers of various plant medicines, such as the Peruvian psychedelic San Pedro and the Amazonian tobacco rapé, which he often snorts midmeeting. He’s abandoned the idea of a schedule and instead spends each day surrendering to, as he puts it, the “flow” of where he’s pulled, blasting global trance music from his speaker along the way. “I’m normally running three to 10 meetings at a time,” Pierce says. “I just pile them all up. I have no schedule and everybody just kind of meets at the same time. It sometimes makes people who are really important in their minds very uncomfortable because they’re used to getting an automatic three hours alone.” As this giant ball of high net worth and wanna-be-high-net-worth rolls down the colorful streets of San Juan, two police officers stand on the corner and point at Pierce: “Mr. Bitcoin,” one of them says. Nearly every local in San Juan seems to be aware of the crypto hordes doing business in the streets, cafes and monuments of the old city. Josh Boles, an entrepreneur in Pierce’s inner circle, winces. “Now that the Forbes list came out, we really need to get security in place,” he says. “Too many people know.” Pierce and company round a corner onto Calle del Cristo, where a cafe hawker urges them to sit at his establishment. Pierce obliges. Not because he’s hungry, but because part of going with the flow is always saying yes. To remind himself of this, he is planning to get a tattoo on his arm, in binary code, that will read “Yes please.” As the Sol crew is drinking beer and eating chips, a Sam Rockwell-looking American in a sleeveless T-shirt depicting the Hindu god Ganesh rounds the corner and his jaw drops. He and a friend trailing behind him rush up to Pierce. “I don’t know what I’m doing, but I know that I’m supposed to be here,” he gushes, and introduces himself as Danny Wojcik. After reading about Crypto Rico, Wojcik, a 29-year-old crypto enthusiast and poker player from Vegas, flew down, found an Airbnb and is now telling Pierce, “We’re gonna build a new civilization.” “No, no, no,” Pierce corrects him. He invites Wojcik and his friend, Devin Hunter, to sit with him. “Let me tell you a little bit about why we’re here. We’re here to help Puerto Rico. We’re here in service, and we serve through gifting. We’re here to take our skills – our superpowers – and figure out how to help Puerto Rico, the Earth and the people. And integrate by supporting them, becoming one with them. That is how a good guest shows up in a new place. You got skills? You wanna put them to work? We’ll do everything we possibly can to help make that happen for you. Obviously, that’s what we’re here for, so thank you for hearing the call and getting on the next plane. So you landed how long ago?” “A couple of hours ago,” Wojcik says. “How long are you renting your place for?” “Honestly, like, we’re supposed to be here until Tuesday. But I’ll be here as long as possible, though. I’m ready.” Pierce continues onboarding them: “There’s probably about 50 to a hundred of us that moved here. We probably now have 20 companies, right? But that 50 to a hundred people is about to be 500 to a thousand. And those 20 or 30 companies are about to be two to three hundred, and a lot of these are some of the top tech startups capitalized. When you start to bring this brain gain into this society, you have to bring an opportunity for jobs to the west coast of the island, because we don’t want Old San Juan to become San Francisco and drive up rent and piss off the people.” Soon, the cafe waiter joins the conversation and tells them about the struggles of the mountain village he comes from in Utuado, where there’s still little electricity and elderly people are in need of medical care. Wojcik and Hunter have their first Sol mission: “You wanna go there tomorrow and do some scouting?” Pierce asks them. “Let’s get an inventory of what’s needed and make it happen.” This is a textbook example of how Pierce operates: in deals per minute, or dpms. Where most famous people might blow off a touter standing outside a tourist cafe, or deflect the overtures of an adoring fan, Pierce says yes and brings them into his inner circle with a promise of opportunity. He explains that this is because he sees life like a video game: “The universe is constantly throwing more coins and power-ups at you, and if you keep collecting them, you get more points and you go up in levels.” Isn’t he worried about someone taking advantage of him or doing bad work that ruins something? “I don’t know any of the people I keep inviting out with us,” he quickly responds. “I don’t have time to even check. If you are making that effort, I’m gonna trust you. And if you’re legit, I’m gonna give you all the tools I have until I see that you don’t operate with integrity.” Two days later, Pierce is splayed out in a chair in the back of a private plane, discussing his childhood in Minnesota. He is on his way to the Satoshi Roundtable, outside Cancún, an annual gathering of the crypto elite, and apologizes several times for taking a private plane, explaining that it’s not a matter of luxury but of being time-efficient. His father was a homebuilder, he recalls, and his mom was a professional disco dancer until she got pregnant with him at age 20. Like many stage moms, she might have channeled her unrealized dreams into her son. And like with many child actors, his first memory is of being on a set. Pierce was three and a half, and filming a commercial called “Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.” (The irony is not lost on the man wearing the cowboy hat.) When a film called “The Mighty Ducks” came to town, Pierce landed a part as a younger version of Emilio Estevez’s character, Gordon Bombay. This was followed in quick succession with bit parts in other movies shot in Minnesota: “Untamed Heart,” with Christian Slater, and “Little Big League.” After landing a part in “D2: Mighty Ducks,” which filmed in Los Angeles, he stayed, along with his mom and younger brother. His mother eventually divorced his dad, telling Brock, he says, “I’m doing it for you. It’s for your career.” (Pierce remembers this as “a little heavy for a 13-year-old.”) To get roles, he began performing magic tricks that an uncle had taught him. “Fifty kids would come in to read their lines for three minutes, then leave,” he remembers. “I’d walk in and do a magic trick with coins and cards. Next thing you know, it’s 15 minutes later and we’re talking about everything imaginable. … At the end of the day, I wasn’t a better actor. I was just the only one they could remember.” Meanwhile, Pierce had already shown signs of life as an entrepreneur: As he tells it, back in Minnesota, he set up multiple lemonade stands, then staffed them with neighborhood children, and did the same for businesses delivering newspapers, shoveling driveways and mowing lawns. Foreshadowing his later video-game empire, he wrote cheat guides for games like “Mortal Kombat 2,” then sold them to his classmates. In LA, he bought and sold rare Magic the Gathering cards, “Star Trek” memorabilia and other collectibles. “As a kid, I had infinite money,” he says. “And so I knew how to always make it.” After playing the titular role in “First Kid,” as the son of the president, with Sinbad as his Secret Service agent, Pierce says he “wanted to be a normal kid again.” So before the movie was released, he returned to Minnesota and joined his peers in ninth grade. “I literally walked away from all of the opportunity,” he says. “I’ve been doing this my whole life. Once you reinvent yourself three, four, five times, you eventually just realize you can do this infinitely, with whatever time you have.” After a few months of trying to assimilate, he realized that a normal childhood was impossible due to his fame. He returned to LA, where he emancipated himself from his mother and eventually moved to the other side of the camera as an associate producer on a film called “Young Hollywood,” which was never released. When he was 16, an actor friend introduced him to a wealthy internet entrepreneur named Marc Collins-Rector. And this is where Pierce’s story starts to get murky. Collins-Rector’s company was called Digital Entertainment Network (DEN). Predating YouTube and Netflix originals, DEN was intended to create youth-oriented programming for the internet. By Pierce’s account, he laid out his vision to Collins-Rector of a world watching short-form videos online, and Collins-Rector made Pierce co-founder and executive vice president, giving him a quarter of a million dollars a year and a five percent stake in the company. “He told me, ‘I’m going to show you how it all works, which means you have to be in every meeting,’” Pierce says of Collins-Rector. “If someone said, ‘Oh, I don’t want Brock in the meeting,’ he said, ‘There’s no meeting.’ For someone that enabled so much for me, you’re going to be loyal.” Pierce’s last sentence is a loaded one, and raises the question of the extent of his loyalty to Collins-Rector. “He was definitely in love with me,” Pierce says. “There’s no question about that, and I’m OK with that. That’s not a bad thing.” Collins-Rector was in a relationship with Chad Shackley, the third founder of DEN. They reportedly met years earlier, when Shackley was 16 and living in Bay City, Michigan. Collins-Rector was in his early thirties at the time. At DEN, he wanted to make a show about Shackley’s life, “Chad’s World,” which Pierce produced as his first project. “It was working for me,” Pierce says. “No problem. Not in a negative way, but [Collins-Rector] was basically under a spell.” Then, in 1999, as DEN was about to go public, a lawsuit arrived from a young man in Michigan accusing Collins-Rector of luring him across state lines for sex while he was underage. According to Pierce, Collins-Rector said the lawsuit was “inaccurate” and vowed to fight it. But, Pierce claims, DEN’s executive team told him to persuade Collins-Rector to settle the suit and “make it go away.” “I convinced Marc to do that,” Pierce says. “I should have never done that.” According to one court document, Collins-Rector settled for $1 million, but the story broke anyway, and Collins-Rector left his position and fled to Europe, persuading Pierce and Shackley to step down and join him as well. While they were jet-setting abroad, a new lawsuit was filed by three male actors who spent time at Collins-Rector’s mansion and claimed to be employed by DEN. They accused him, along with Shackley and Pierce, of sexual assault. One of the three actors, Michael Egan, was underage at the time. The complaint, filed on July 20th, 2000, in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges a pattern of abuse inflicted on all three plaintiffs. They claimed they would come to the house where Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce were staying, and be offered or dosed with illegal drugs. The three plaintiffs would allegedly be forced to engage in sexual contact with the defendants. The suit alleges that Collins-Rector would threaten everything from physical violence to Hollywood blacklisting in order to keep his victims silent. Pierce adamantly denies the accusations against him, noting that he was 17 and 18 during this period. He also says one of the plaintiffs, Egan, originally tried to get him to join the lawsuit. “I told him, ‘Of course not, I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.’ That was the greatest mistake I ever made. If I had just said, ‘Let me think about it,’ instead of immediately rejecting the idea, everything would have gone completely differently. Because I could be a star witness against them, now they had to discredit me.” (Despite repeated attempts, including phone calls to his former lawyers, Egan could not be reached for comment.) Christopher Turcotte, then a 15-year-old actor who regularly hung out at Collins-Rector’s house, was a witness to many of the events there. He says that Egan “had sexual contact that I saw with my own eyes” with Collins-Rector. Like Pierce, Turcotte describes Egan approaching him about being part of a lawsuit. He wanted Turcotte to claim that he too was raped by Collins-Rector, Turcotte says, “when in all reality that never happened.” When asked about Pierce’s involvement, Turcotte says, “Brock did not take part in this, not at all.” According to a court filing, Pierce claimed that he didn’t know about the accusations until two and a half years after they were filed. Around 2003, he says, he returned to the United States, hired a lawyer and met with Egan and another of his accusers, Mark Ryan. The third plaintiff, Alex Burton, dropped the charges against him altogether; Ryan and Egan both settled their cases against Pierce. (Ryan apparently settled without damages, and Egan was awarded $21,600 to cover his legal fees.) After nearly two decades of litigation and intense media coverage, this much is clear: Collins-Rector liked to have teenage boys around him, both personally and professionally. He also appears to have had a pattern of grooming them for sex through expensive gifts, work at inflated salaries and significant career opportunities. When asked how it was possible to spend so much time around Collins-Rector and not be aware of what so many others have alleged, Pierce responds, “No one saw anything or knew anything. It was not something out in the open. I also didn’t know he was doing this to other people. I only heard Turcotte’s version of events four years ago.” Asked why he remained with Collins-Rector despite the lawsuit, Pierce says, “I’m a pariah at this point – no one else would work with me. Of course, I’m going to stay with my friend and partner.” Meanwhile, the trio continued to gallivant around Europe. “He let me accidentally, not knowingly, blow his entire fortune,” Pierce says of Collins-Rector. “I think I spent $16 million in a year. On the best private jets, the most crazy experiences that one could manufacture.” While they were in Marbella, Spain, running out of money together, Collins-Rector was arrested on US criminal charges for transporting minors across state lines for sex that dated back to 1993. Collins-Rector was eventually extradited, and he pleaded guilty. No criminal charges were filed against Shackley or Pierce. Looking back, Pierce says that Collins-Rector “was a shit beyond belief – lies, lies, lies, lies. Like, completely fabricated stories. He knew how to manipulate. Very much the most generous person ever, which is weird, but not a lot of real empathy. Narcissistic.” (Collins-Rector, whose last known residence, according to the Florida sex-offenders’ registry, is the Dominican Republic, could not be reached for comment.) After Collins-Rector’s arrest, Pierce stayed in Europe. “I never once read any of the media,” he recalls. “Reading my name would make me cry. I was so afraid. I wasn’t able to handle it.” Even to this day, he adds, “Anything I accomplish in my life ends up being discredited because of this narrative.” Before he parted ways with Collins-Rector, Pierce had already found his new calling in a childhood hobby: video games. While simultaneously playing three characters on three different computers in Everquest – then five characters, then six – he realized it was possible to make thousands of dollars a day in virtual-world games. RMT, or real-money trade, is the market where in-game coins and items, which take time and effort to collect, are sold for actual currency. “I kept hiring people in Marbella, and the goal was to see if I could get them to the point that they could play three characters at once, and that was how you got a permanent job with us,” Pierce says. “I knew where all the most valuable things in the game were.” This turned into Internet Gaming Entertainment, or IGE. When Pierce noticed that China didn’t have much of an RMT market, he decided: “If I go teach the Chinese how much money they can make playing games, I can build an army.” Weeks after the idea came to him, he moved to Hong Kong, and soon had people all over China playing games like Everquest and World of Warcraft for virtual gold. Pierce eventually earned enough to buy out his closest competitor for $2.4 million, and over time he supposedly had some 400,000 people playing video games for him professionally. In 2005, he hired a former Goldman Sachs banker to help with acquisitions and financing. His name was Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s future chief strategist. “He’s one of the most colorful characters in the world, let alone crypto,” Bannon says of Pierce. “When the history of this is written, Brock is going to be looked at as more of a pioneer. Because right now they look at him as more of a freak show: They get caught up in the hat, the poncho and the dancing.” With Bannon’s help, Goldman Sachs reportedly made a $30 million investment in IGE. “Steve Bannon was my right-hand man for, like, seven years,” Pierce says. “He’s a hammer. And when you’re a hammer, everything looks like a nail. He’s very sure and very smart. Very driven, very patriotic. He’s not most of the things that people say.” By 2007, with IGE besieged by a crackdown from the makers of World of Warcraft and a class-action lawsuit from players accusing the company of ruining the game, Bannon had taken over as CEO. And it was in the online-gamer chatrooms that the seeds of Bannon’s future were planted; as he told journalist Joshua Green for the book “Devil’s Bargain,” “These guys, these rootless white males, had monster power.” Pierce, meanwhile, was about to try to repeat his success in e-sports when people began mentioning cryptocurrency to him roughly a year after the first Bitcoins were mined. Pierce was shocked that he’d never heard of it. “There were no storytellers who knew how to convey the information in simple insights, so it required a lot of real heavy lifting to figure out,” he says. “I didn’t have the time to appreciate the power of decentralization at first. The day I got it, I knew that was it.” Bannon recently took a leap into cryptocurrency as well, not just because of its financial implications, but because of its political ones. “This whole populist revolt is going to come down to this concept of currency,” he says. “You can see the forces that are aligned to take advantage of it. Every smart person that I admire in the world, and those I semi-fear, is focused on this concept of crypto for a reason. They understand that this is the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution: steam engine, electricity, then the microchip – blockchain and crypto is the fourth. There’s going to be a war for control for this.” Once Pierce caught on to the potential of this new digital cash, he became an evangelist, giving away Bitcoins to everyone he could, whether to an influencer or to the audience at one of his talks. He eventually stopped giving the money away because “no one appreciated it, then they lost it, and it was a waste of my fucking time. I get messages all the time from people saying, ‘I think of how much I lost because I didn’t take it seriously.’” Almost every early Bitcoin adopter has a big regret story; Pierce’s is that he had a hard drive with some 50,000 Bitcoins on it, but accidentally threw it out while cleaning his garage. At today’s Bitcoin value, that’s $330 million he jettisoned. By then, Pierce was starting companies at an accelerated pace. He further ramped up his deals per minute by co-founding DNA, which many of the big players in crypto come through at some point for investment or advice. Tuesday pitch meetings in its Santa Monica offices, where startup coins and blockchain businesses seek early investors, have become a hotbed of enthusiasts who are busy networking themselves into new deals, ideas and relationships. Just like in Puerto Rico, Pierce focused the energy and excitement around this disruption into a single location. “I don’t really have to do much other than show up, and then tell a few of these stories that are inspiring,” he says. “If you have a bunch of conversations and entertain everybody and be a great storyteller, people tend to say yes.” The plane lands in Cancún. Pierce walks down the stairs, blasting “The Great Dictator” on his speaker. He grooves to the front of the small customs line at the private terminal, then places the speaker on the desk of the customs agent, telling him, “You looked like you were enjoying it.” Surprisingly, the customs agent doesn’t object (or search everyone’s bags for psychedelics), and the merry band of crypto oddballs continues on to the Grand Velas resort in Playa del Carmen, where the Satoshi Roundtable is being held. As he waits in the lobby for his right-hand man, Stephen Morris, to check him in, Pierce storms up to me with his lips taut and jaw clenched. He stares coldly into my eye sockets, and asks point-blank in his reverberant voice: “Are you a friend or are you an enemy?” Taken aback, I mumble something about being neither. “I’m the guy to be afraid of,” he informs me. “But fortunately I’m a good guy.” His voice softens dramatically. “This world would be a different place if I wasn’t.” He turns and walks away. This encounter, more than anything he said on the plane, seems to show another side of Pierce. Only frightened people tell you to be afraid of them. The conference is a mix of guest speakers (like erstwhile Libertarian presidential candidate Ron Paul), impromptu discussion groups, dinners and parties. At one of the hotel lounges that evening, Edan Yago, whose company Epiphyte helps banks integrate with cryptocurrency, points out, “Notice how very subdued and low-key everyone in this room is, even though half of them are newly minted billionaires and hundreds-of-million-aires.” An hour later, Pierce shows up, very unsubdued, talking about bringing fire-spinners and a DJ from Tulum to liven up the conference. “We show up at every party, and if it’s not ours, it’s ours,” he declares with a beatific smile as he dances his way through the throng. Later that night, Pierce is in business mode, and heads to a hastily arranged phone call with the president of a Caribbean country, whom he’s selling on the advantages of digitizing its dollar. Still later, Pierce is in divine-prophecy mode. The score from “Star Wars” is playing on a speaker, and Pierce is standing up and conducting along, confidently proclaiming, “We are the return of the Jedi in this story. Mankind has been asleep for the last 500 years. It’s going to get very wizardly.” And here you have all the sides of Brock Pierce: visionary and madman, idealist and opportunist, entertainer and businessman, magician and hedonist, narcissist and community builder. “He goes around helping people – he’s a general community nurturer,” says Patrick Byrne, president of Overstock, who’s working on a project that uses the blockchain to combat world poverty by granting and securing property rights. Will O’Brien, an adviser in Blockchain Capital, who has hired Pierce as a consultant, says, “I’ve seen many interactions when Brock makes a promise to an entrepreneur, and he’s followed through every time. That’s integrity.” Meanwhile, some of his closest friends express concern about Pierce’s chaotic schedule, sleeplessness, psychedelic use and general lack of self-care. “One of my missions with Brock is to keep him alive right now,” a member of his entourage confides. “He’s in a bit of a self-destructive pattern.” If Pierce is a force that makes movements happen, those movements often seem to leave him behind in order to grow. This year, for example, EOS, the cryptocurrency that Pierce is most associated with, has blown up. Despite Pierce’s role in its success, in March he parted ways with Block.one, the company he co-founded that developed EOS. Pierce says there were “25 reasons for it,” including that he was “too much of a lightning rod and everyone was focusing on my involvement in a way that wasn’t positive.” The subtext is that if you embrace risk, Pierce is an asset; if you’re risk-averse, he could be a liability. “When it’s about the vision, Brock can help pull it together,” Bannon says. “Once you go from the vision world to the analog world of getting it done, Brock steps aside.” After the Satoshi Roundtable, Pierce is back on a private plane, returning to San Juan. He leans in and apologizes for confronting me in the hotel lobby. He explains that he panicked about oversharing, and thought that maybe I was only there to write another sensational DEN story. “I’ve given you everything,” he elaborates a little later. “Everything. More than I’ve ever told my wife.” The plane touches down in San Juan, and Pierce is back in his element as pied piper. I ask how the committee planning Pierce’s billion-dollar giveaway fared. The plan is to create a charity cryptocurrency token, tentatively called One, of which Pierce will buy $1 billion worth and then inspire other individuals to do something similar. He directs me to a messaging channel where a small group is debating nearly everything, from the name of the coin to the causes that matter most. I notice that Pierce joins the discussion only when necessary, preferring once again to set a wheel in motion, then stand back and watch it spin. As of this writing, it has been nine months since Pierce first mentioned giving away $1 billion, and there still hasn’t been a white paper released or a penny given. But Pierce says that he is actively working on a structure for the endowment. “Giving away a billion dollars is harder than it looks,” he says. “It doesn’t happen in a weekend at a hackathon. I’ll publish a one-page comprehensive answer so that it doesn’t become a point of criticism.” On another afternoon in Puerto Rico, Pierce is on the rooftop terrace of the Airbnb apartment where he (presumably) slept that night. He is meeting with two executives of nonprofits who were born in Puerto Rico, and they have not come to welcome him to the island. “When I heard about him, I had a moment of ‘Oh, my God, they’re gonna gentrify my island,’ ” confides Nancy Santiago Negrón, a vice president at Hispanics in Philanthropy. “ ‘We’re gonna be sold off in pieces, and it won’t be mine anymore.’ And then when I heard about them taking over the children’s museum, my panic went up.” Santiago Negrón grills Pierce about his intentions on the island. After an hour of Pierce’s charm defense, the hostility is gone. And soon, the pair are standing up with their arms intertwined, music is playing, and she is teaching him to salsa-dance. As the bizarre meeting concludes, Santiago Negrón, all sweat and smiles, texts a friend: “I met the crypto guys to yell at them, but they’re kind of nice, so I didn’t yell at them.” While leaving, she happens to mention needing an office in Puerto Rico. Pierce quickly suggests, “You can squat with us if you want.” And that’s the magic of Pierce: In his own optimistic, forward-driving, chaotic way, he makes things happen for those around him, whether they work for charities or hedge funds – or never worked a day in their lives. That is why, whether he does everything he says he will for Puerto Rico or not, whether he ends up giving away his entire fortune or not, whether he becomes a pariah again or not, Pierce will likely land on his feet and live to extol the virtues of the next next big thing. Too many people owe him too much. “You know the concept of compounding interest?” Pierce asks after they leave. “I’m into compounding impact.” He pauses to let the words land. “This is not yet measurable by anything I’ve ever seen, but I believe this is a universal truth, one of the great secrets: The more you give, the more you get.” And with that, Pierce takes a hit of rapé, lets it wash over him, then leaps up and leads his entourage into the streets of San Juan, where he will walk around like the living embodiment of decentralized blockchain technology: jumping from node to node, making bold promises about the future of money, the Internet and humanity – and leaving most everyone in his wake inspired, confused and hoping that this dream will come true.

Don Young of Alaska urged the Department of Energy to set a timeline on how long it would take to privatize the U.S. territory's power company, saying that five or 10 years is ""too damn long.""""We are going to privatize this unit,"" he said. ""It has been a failure. Puerto Ricans deserve better.""A few hundred Puerto Ricans remain without power more than 10 months after the hurricane destroyed up to 75 percent of transmission lines. Crews are still trying to repair and rebuild the grid in the middle of this year's hurricane season as the company struggles with a high turnover, naming its fifth director since Maria.Before testimony began, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the committee, said the objective of the hearing was the health and safety of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens.""We're not talking about federalizing anything ... or selling assets to the highest bidder,"" he said.The statement appeared to be a response to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who declined to attend the hearing. He sent a letter to Bishop saying his administration has worked hard to overhaul the company, known as PREPA, and upgrade the still fragile grid.""The transformation is a complex process, and it would be unnecessary and inappropriate for Congress to give the Department of Energy control of PREPA, effectively robbing the island of a critical resource at a perilous time for Puerto Rico,"" Rossello wrote.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far allocated $6 billion for Puerto Rico's electrical grid, although not all of it has been spent, officials said.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-demands-quick-privatization-of-puerto-rico-power-agency,Fox,Conservative
79,"Hurricane Maria leaves Puerto Rico powerless, at least 15 dead on Dominica",Travis Fedschun,2018-07-16,"Hurricane Maria regained major hurricane status early Thursday, strengthening to a Category 3 storm, as it left a devastated -- and completely powerless -- Puerto Rico in its wake and at least 15 dead people in Dominica.The prime minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, said at least 15 people died after the storm hit the island and 20 people were missing. Maria is also deemed responsible two deaths on Guadeloupe and one in Puerto Rico.Skerrit cried as he spoke to a reporter with ABS TV/Radio on the nearby island of Antigua, the Associated Press reported.He said it was a miracle the death toll was not in the hundreds, adding Dominica ""is going to need all the help the world has to offer.""The strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in more than 80 years left the entire island without electricity, making it difficult to assess just how much damage was caused by Maria's unrelenting onslaught.The storm, with winds of 120 mph and traveling northwest at 9 mph, is now passing the northeastern Dominican Republic and headed for the Turks and Caicos. It was centered about 135 miles southeast of Grand Turk Island as of Thursday morning.""Once we're able to go outside, we're going to find our island destroyed,"" said Abner Gomez, Puerto Rico's emergency management director. ""The information we have received is not encouraging. It's a system that has destroyed everything in its path.""Uprooted trees and widespread flooding blocked many highways and streets across the island, creating a maze that forced drivers to go against traffic and past police cars that used loudspeakers to warn people they must respect an overnight curfew imposed by the governor to ensure everyone's safety.Maria hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, weakened to a Category 2 as it tore through the island and then regained strength as it came close to the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos Islands.""The hit on Puerto Rico has been devastating with over 2 feet of rain, incredible storm surge and the whole island without power,"" Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean said Thursday. ""It is the worst disaster Puerto Rico has experienced in a generation.  We have yet to see the devastation they are waking up to.""""It is the worst disaster Puerto Rico has experienced in a generation. We have yet to see the devastation they are waking up to.""The hurricane was still dumping rain early Thursday in Puerto Rico, where crumbled red roof tiles lay scattered across many roads, and curious residents ducked under dozens of black power lines still swaying in heavy winds.More than 11,000 people — and more than 580 pets — were in shelters, authorities said.In the island's capital of San Juan, eucalyptus trees fell nearly every other block over a main road dotted with popular bars, restaurants, and coffee shops, some of which were damaged.Outside a nearby apartment building, 40-year-old tourism company operator Adrian Pacheco told the AP how he spent eight hours in a stairwell huddled with 100 other residents when the hurricane ripped the storm shutters off his building and decimated three balconies.""I think people didn't expect the storm to reach the point that it did,"" he said. ""Since Irma never really happened, they thought Maria would be the same.""Officials are unable to say when electricity would return on the island, which was already crumbling amid lack of maintenance and a dwindling staff even before the Hurricanes Irma and Maria knocked out power. Many now believe it will take weeks, if not months, to restore power.President Donald Trump approved a disaster declaration for Puerto Rico early Thursday after Maria slammed into the U.S. territory. The declaration makes federal funding available to Puerto Ricans affected by the storm.On the northern part of the island, the mayor of one coastal town said he received reports of one area losing 80 percent of the homes in the area.Catano Mayor Felix Delgado said the small fishing community near the San Juan Bay was inundated with more than 4 feet of storm surge from Maria.Delgado told ElNuevoDía.com ""this generation is going to play to build the new Catano.""As of now, Maria poses no immediate threat to the U.S. mainland. The long-range forecast showed the storm out in the Atlantic Ocean hundreds of miles off the Georgia-South Carolina coast by Monday morning.“Residents across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast will still need to monitor Maria's path, although it looks likely the storm will stay offshore,” Dean said Thursday..",https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-maria-leaves-puerto-rico-powerless-at-least-15-dead-on-dominica,Fox,Conservative
111,Man faces hate crime charges over racist Puerto Rico shirt rant,Joe Tacopino,2018-07-12,"A Chicago man who was caught on video unleashing a racist tirade against a woman wearing a Puerto Rico shirt was hit with felony hate crime charges on Thursday. Timothy Trybus, 62, originally faced misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges for the incident where he angrily confronted the woman and told her she “shouldn’t be wearing that” — referring to the shirt. He now faces two counts of felony hate crime, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office told The Post. “After a review of the case, we approved felony hate crimes charges,” a spokesman for the attorney’s office told the Chicago Tribune. During the encounter, 24-year-old Mia Irizarry was aggressively questioned about her citizenship by Trybus, who cops eventually said was drunk at the time. “You shouldn’t be wearing that,” he said, referring to a shirt that read Puerto Rico and displayed the flag. “You’re not going to change us,” 62-year-old Trybus is heard saying in the video. “The world is not going to change the United States of America. You should not be wearing that in the United States of America.” Puerto Rico has been a US territory since 1899.

112,Cop quits over video of him ignoring woman harassed for Puerto Rico shirt,Joe Tacopino,2018-07-11,"A Chicago police officer reportedly quit on Wednesday after he was captured on video ignoring a woman’s pleas as she is harassed over her “Puerto Rico” shirt. The Cook County Forest Preserve said that Officer Patrick Connor resigned after outrage over his inaction during the June 14 incident, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. A disciplinary hearing was scheduled for Thursday, the paper said. “We are further addressing aspects of this incident and General Superintendent Arnold Randall will have more details at a media availability tomorrow morning,” the forest preserve said. During the encounter, 24-year-old Mia Irizarry was aggressively questioned about her citizenship by a man who said she “shouldn’t be wearing that” — referring to a shirt that read Puerto Rico and displayed the flag. “You’re not going to change us,” 62-year-old Timothy Trybus is heard saying in the video. “The world is not going to change the United States of America. You should not be wearing that in the United States of America.” Puerto Rico has been a US territory since 1899. As the woman pleads for help from the officer, Connor appears to simply ignore her. Eventually, more officers arrived and Trybus was arrested on charges of assault and disorderly conduct. Cops said that Trybus was drunk.

114,Storm-wracked Puerto Rico braces for first Hurricane of the season,Laura Italiano,2018-07-06,"The first hurricane of the season is heading toward storm-wracked Puerto Rico — and may make landfall there on Monday. Forecasters believe that Hurricane Beryl will begin slowing down before it hits, though its governor, Ricardo Rossello, declared a state of emergency. “Because of the small size of Beryl and anticipated weakening, widespread wind damage is not expected,” according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Jake Sojda. It will probably be a just a tropical storm by the time it visits the island around Monday afternoon, experts said. Still, it will carry “significant moisture” and may cause some local flooding, said AccuWeather’s chairman, Joel Myers. “As we know, Puerto Rico was hard hit last year by Hurricanes Irma and then Maria, and the island is still recovering,” Myers said. “Any heavy rainfall is capable of causing flash flooding,” given the island’s already damaged infrastructure, he said. Power lines and property repairs that have been “jury-rigged” instead of properly fixed could fail and lead to power outages and home damage, Sojda said.

115,Puerto Rico to release storm death data after court ruling,Associated Press,2018-06-05,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s government said Tuesday it will comply with a court ruling that orders officials to release all death certificates issued after Hurricane Maria hit the US territory amid allegations that the official death toll of 64 is severely undercounted. The court said in its ruling earlier in the day that the government also has to turn over other information, including copies of all burial and cremation permits issued after the Category 4 storm and allow access to the demographic registrar’s database that details causes of death. “The information … is public by nature,” wrote Judge Lauracelis Roques. “People still don’t have a clear picture as to how many lives were lost due to a lack of food, medicine, health services or simply because of an ineffective response to an emergency. That’s why it’s urgent to shed light on all components of government preparedness and response.” The government has seven days to comply with the ruling, which responds to a lawsuit filed by CNN and Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism. “Our policy, by petition of Gov. Ricardo Rossello Nevares, is to work with the strictest transparency and facilitate access to all public information,” Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario said in a statement. Rossello and other government officials had withheld certain information, saying in recent days that it was confidential. “They’re wrong,” the judge wrote. “Allowing the truth to be known would contribute to and smooth a path toward a process of recovery from the great pain that Hurricane Maria caused to thousands of Puerto Rican families.” The ruling comes just days after Puerto Rico’s Institute of Statistics filed a lawsuit against the island’s health department and demographic registry seeking more data on the number of deaths reported after Maria. Hours after that lawsuit was filed, the health department said that an additional 1,397 overall deaths were reported from September to December in 2017, compared with the same period the previous year. However, officials did not provide causes of death for any of the 11,459 total people deceased during the period. A Harvard study published last week estimates that there were up to 4,600 more deaths than usual in the three months after Maria, although some independent experts questioned the methods and the number in that study. Previous studies have found that the number of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths is higher than the official toll, including a 2017 report that said there were nearly 500 more deaths than usual on the island in September. A team of experts at George Washington University is leading an independent review to determine the number of deaths caused by Maria. A preliminary report was due in May, but the team was granted more time. ",https://nypost.com/2018/06/05/puerto-rico-to-release-storm-death-data-after-court-ruling/,New York Post,Conservative
80,Puerto Rico grid 'teetering' despite $3.8 billion repair job,,2018-05-31,"CAIN ALTO, Puerto Rico  After months of darkness and stifling heat, Noe Pagan was overjoyed when power-line workers arrived to restore electricity to his home deep in the lush green mountains of western Puerto Rico. But to his dismay, instead of raising a power pole toppled by Hurricane Maria, the federal contractors bolted the new 220-volt line to the narrow trunk of a breadfruit tree — a safety code violation virtually guaranteed to leave Pagan and his neighbors blacked out in a future hurricane.""I asked the contractors if they were going to connect the cable to the post and they just didn't answer,"" said Pagan, a 23-year-old garage worker.After an eight-month, $3.8 billion federal effort to try to end the longest blackout in United States history, officials say Puerto Rico's public electrical authority, the nation's largest, is almost certain to collapse again when the next hurricane hits this island of 3.3 million people.""It's a highly fragile and vulnerable system that really could suffer worse damage than it suffered with Maria in the face of another natural catastrophe,"" Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello said.Another weather disaster is increasingly likely as warmer seas turbocharge the strongest hurricanes into even more powerful and wetter storms. Federal forecasters say there's a 75 percent likelihood that the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, which begins Friday, will produce between five and nine hurricanes. And there's a 70 percent chance that as many as four of those could be major Category 3, 4, or 5 hurricanes, with winds of 111 mph (179 kph) or higher.""It's inevitable that Puerto Rico will get hit again,"" said Assistant Secretary Bruce Walker, head of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity, which is planning the long-term redesign of the grid run by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.Despite the billions plowed into the grid since Maria hit on Sept. 20, 2017, Puerto Rican officials warn that it could take far less than a Category 4 storm like Maria to cause a blackout like the one that persists today, with some 11,820 homes and businesses still without power.""The grid is there, but the grid isn't there. It's teetering,"" said Hector Pesquera, Puerto Rico's commissioner of public safety. ""Even if it's a (Category) 1, it is in such a state that I think we're going to lose power. I don't know for how long.""Federal officials and Puerto Rican leaders blame decades of mismanagement that left the island's power authority more than $9 billion in debt after declaring bankruptcy last year. Expensive projects were launched then cancelled. Politicians approved cheap power for well-connected corporations. By the time Maria hit, wooden power poles were rotted, transmission towers had rusted through and overgrown trees menaced thousands of miles of power lines.In many places across Puerto Rico, federal emergency funds allocated in the aftermath of the disaster made up for years of neglected maintenance, replacing decaying infrastructure with tens of thousands of new poles and hundreds of miles of power lines rushed from the U.S. mainland at a steep premium.But in other areas, crews without adequate supplies patched together damaged poles and power lines in a desperate push to restore power. In the western highlands, power cables were spliced together and woven haphazardly through trees in blatant violation of basic safety codes. In Pagan's town of Cain Alto and at least one other location, trees were used as makeshift power poles in the absence of proper equipment.""We patched things up. We worked with the little material that was available and we recycled material. We took the 1,000 feet of wire that was on the ground and we strung it up in another area,"" one power authority worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from management. ""We took the post that had fallen over or broken and we put it up somewhere else. A lot of the work is defective.""Fredyson Martinez, vice president of the power authority workers' union, said he estimates that roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of the repair work done over the last eight months did not meet basic quality standards.""The logistics were terrible. I give it an F,"" he said. ""Things need to be fixed.""Federal and Puerto Rican officials are preparing for another catastrophe that cuts power for weeks or month. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is leaving some 600 generators installed in key sites such as hospitals and water pumping stations, more than six times the number before Maria. FEMA has stockpiled 5.4 million liters of water and more than 80,000 tarps, and is distributing them and other emergency supplies to towns across the island so they will be in place for the next disaster.Still, few people believe the island is truly ready.""If a hurricane comes tomorrow it will leave the island completely without power again,"" said Juan Rosario, a community activist and former member of the power authority's board of directors.Up to 4,645 more deaths than usual occurred in Puerto Rico in the three months after Maria, contends a new study published this week by the New England Journal of Medicine, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll of 64.Officials now are warning Puerto Ricans to stockpile enough emergency supplies to survive as long as 10 days without help. Tens of thousands of homes still don't have roofs. FEMA distributed 59,000 enormous plastic sheets to homeowners who lost their roofs in Irma or Maria. More than 100,000 more received smaller tarps to protect specific rooms or belongings. Only 21,000 households have received federal aid to carry out permanent repairs.Juana Sostre Vasquez's wooden house in the central highlands was ripped off its foundation by Maria. With the help of a son-in-law, the 69-year-old rebuilt, using cinderblocks and cement bought with $14,000 in FEMA reconstruction aid. Her roof is metal sheeting nailed onto wooden two-by-fours because she couldn't afford to build stronger. She says she's hopeful the next hurricane won't send that sheeting flying.""The money didn't let us do the roof,"" she said. ""I'm doing it little by little as I save a couple of dollars.""Mike Byrne, the head of FEMA's Caribbean office, says he expects the federal government will eventually have spent a total of $17.5 billion in emergency funds on fixing the hurricane damage and making Puerto Rico's grid more resilient to future storms.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ended its power restoration work in May, so future funding is expected to pass through Puerto Rico's bankrupt power company. After receiving $945 million in federal funds for repairs to the island's electric grid, Oklahoma-based Mammoth Energy Services announced Monday that the power authority had awarded its subsidiary, Cobra Energy, another $900 million to finish the job and begin fortifying the grid against future storms.Last week, Cobra's crews were working to rebuild one of a pair of 230-kilo-volt transmission lines climbing from Puerto Rico's main power plants on its southern coast across high mountains to the main users of energy in the capital, San Juan, and other industrial sites and population centers in the north. Because of a decision years ago to stretch the island's main transmission lines through a narrow path across the rugged mountains, one of the transmission lines must be turned off so its powerful current doesn't energize equipment and workers laboring a few feet away.Cobra transmission director Alan Edwards had more than 50 linemen working on the repair, at nearly $4,000 per worker per day in federal funds from the Puerto Rico power authority, when he got the call to stop. A flaw was causing a transmission line to overheat dangerously elsewhere in the system, so the line alongside where Edwards' men were working would have to be returned to service, forcing the crews to stop for at least the rest of the day.""Maybe we're back at it tomorrow, I don't know. May be next week before we can get back out there,"" Edwards said.The already staggering reconstruction costs will rise by billions more if another hurricane hits. And many billions worth of those federally funded improvements could eventually pass into private hands: Puerto Rico's Senate could approve the sale of much of the island's power grid to a private power company or companies as early as this week.The potential sale won't affect the federal government's decision to spend billions of dollars on repairing and improving the grid, said Byrne, the head of FEMA's operations in the Caribbean.""I can't wait, because these are U.S. citizens that are at risk. U.S. citizens deserve every ounce of effort that I can bring to this, and that's what they're going to get,"" Byrne said.____Michael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-grid-teetering-despite-3-8-billion-repair-job,Fox,Conservative
116,Hurricane Maria’s death toll was far worse than officials said,Aaron Feis,2018-05-29,"The actual number of people who died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria is closer to 4,700 than the official government count of 64, according to a new study. A Harvard University research team surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen Puerto Rican households and extrapolated the findings to estimate that the island likely saw 4,645 “excess deaths” between the storm’s Sept. 20, 2017, landfall and Dec. 31, 2017. “Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,” the researchers wrote. Factoring in “excess deaths” — deaths that would not have occurred had the island not found itself in a prolonged disaster in the storm’s wake — there is a 95 percent likelihood that the actual death toll sits between 800 and 8,500, according to the study published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The 4,645 figure represents an estimate within that range. The researchers attributed many of the deaths to the interruption of health care, electricity and utility services after the hurricane decimated the island. Much of the US territory was left without electricity after the Category 4 storm lashed the island, downing power lines and crippling the power grid. The death rate is a contentious subject, in part because the federal government didn’t respond as rapidly to the disaster as it has in other hurricane emergencies. The study noted that 83 percent of the households in Puerto Rico were without electricity for the time period examined. Maria caused $90 billion in damage, making it the third-costliest tropical cyclone in the United States since 1900, the researchers said. “The timely estimation of the death toll after a natural disaster is critical to defining the scale and severity of the crisis and to targeting interventions for recovery,” the scientists wrote in the study. “As the United States prepares for its next hurricane season, it will be critical to review how disaster-related deaths will be counted, in order to mobilize an appropriate response operation and account for the fate of those affected.” The government of Puerto Rico commissioned its own researchers from George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health to estimate excess deaths. Results of that study have been delayed and are due out this summer. “We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,” said Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration.

Chan School of Public Health and published in The New England Journal of Medicine — dismissed the official death toll of 64 as “a substantial underestimate.” Scientists conducted a study surveying random households on the U.S. territory and found there were 4,645 hurricane-related deaths between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31 2017.“In early December 2017, the official death count in Puerto Rico stood at 64, but several independent investigations concluded that additional deaths attributable to the hurricane were in excess of 1000 in the months of September and October,” the study stated.STORM DEALT PUERTO RICO KNOCKOUT BLOW AFTER DECADES OF FISCAL FAILURE, CORRUPTIONExperts compared the number of deaths found between September and December to the same period in 2016, when the island wasn’t devastated by a storm.Researchers, however, believe the number they provided is still an underestimate. They believe the actual death count exceeds 5,000.The storm that hit the island in September caused months of power outages and repairs on the Caribbean island, which endured Hurricane Irma the week before Maria came -- both Category 5 storms. Things on the island went from bad to catastrophic as local leaders pointed fingers at the U.S. government for not doing enough.""This should be a day of collective mourning in Puerto Rico,"" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz tweeted on Tuesday. ""Thousands dead because of administrations that could not get the job done.""However, Puerto Rico was already suffering from decades of dysfunction, mismanagement and embarrassing abuses of power. Enormous debt, absurd infrastructure projects and a tradition of corruption have hampered the commonwealth's ability to get off the canvas.“There’ve been so many problems that have built up year after year,” Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News in March. “It’s a tough situation.”PUERTO RICO IN 'FRAGILE STATE' SIX MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE MARIAHarvard researchers found that many Puerto Rican residents went 84 days without electricity, 68 days without water and 41 days without cell service from when Maria hit to the end of 2017.

117,Crooked cop targeted hip-hop club to score freebies: suit,Tina Moore,2018-05-22,"A commanding officer at a Brooklyn precinct tried to shake down a hip-hop club owner for free round-trip plane tickets to Puerto Rico and a generator after Hurricane Maria, according to a new $125 million notice of claim. Sunset Park Love & Lust club owner Imran Jairam says his joint was repeatedly unfairly targeted by cops and the State Liquor Authority for inspections since it opened in 2014 — and then-NYPD Deputy Inspector Emmanuel Gonzalez came to him with his hand out in 2017 to get freebies for an off-duty humanitarian trip to Puerto Rico. The owner says he didn’t follow up except to put the top cop in touch with a hip-hop artist. As the attempted shakedown was going on, his club was still being hit with inspections and summonses, according to court papers. Gonzalez came to Jairam after three years of “biased and selective enforcement,” the claim says. The enforcement actions were “designed to drive him out of business.” The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

83,Puerto Rico to rebuild power grid using US national standard,,2018-05-07," The new CEO of Puerto Rico's power company announced Monday that the public agency will immediately adopt a U.S. national standard to design and rebuild the island's power grid following Hurricane Maria.That measure will make it easier for the Electric Power Authority to maintain power lines and replace them after a storm, and crews will be able to obtain materials more quickly, CEO Walter Higgins said.""It's a great step forward for faster restoration from storms and improving technology of the grid,"" he said in a statement. ""It ensures that all of our future construction and activities in the grid will be done to a standard that is widely adopted and widely used in the United States.""It was not immediately clear why Puerto Rico had not previously adopted such a standard and whether the government has already started to rebuild and design a stronger power grid. Higgins was not available for comment, and power company spokesman Carlos Monroig said he did not have details.More than 29,000 customers remain without power nearly eight months after the Category 4 storm destroyed up to 75 percent of the U.S. territory's distribution lines. Officials have said a lack of materials and rough terrain have in part delayed power restoration efforts as anger grows over the lack of electricity in dozens of communities.Higgins said emergency measures taken so far to restore power must be upgraded or replaced to permanent standards.In April, federal officials told a congressional hearing that they expected to have a plan by June on how to strengthen and stabilize Puerto Rico's electrical grid. Many worry the plan comes too late: The Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and power outages remain common across Puerto Rico.Just hours before Higgins' announcement, Puerto Rico legislators said they would investigate an island-wide power outage that occurred April 18 and scrutinize what kind of steps the power company took to restore electricity and ensure it would not happen again. It was the second such outage in less than two years.Puerto Rico's power company is $14 billion in debt and operating with infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average. The governor announced in January that he aims to privatize the company as local and federal officials continue to restore power, with up to $2 billion of $18.5 billion in disaster recovery grants slated to help rebuild the grid.Also on Monday, Gov. Ricardo Rossello released details on how his administration plans to use an additional $1.5 billion in federal funds to help the U.S. territory recover from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. At least $817 million will go to rebuilding single-family homes and $45 million will help with mortgage payments.In addition, the plan earmarks $36 million for developing renewable energy projects for homes, $12.5 million for building housing for the homeless and domestic violence victims and $15 million for promoting the island as a tourism destination to help revive the economy.The funds were awarded through the Community Development Block Grant program.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-to-rebuild-power-grid-using-us-national-standard,Fox,Conservative

118,Power restored for most of Puerto Rico after huge blackout,Yaron Steinbuch,2018-04-19,"Electricity has been restored to more than 80 percent of customers affected by an outage that plunged the entire island of Puerto Rico into darkness after an excavator struck a transmission line, officials said Thursday. The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority said more than 1.1 million of its clients got their power back after Wednesday’s blackout, which came almost seven months after Hurricane Maria struck. Utility workers hoped to restore power to the remaining 326,000 customers later in the day, officials said. The power line failure in southern Puerto Rico sparked the first blackout to affect the entire US territory of 3.4 million people since Maria slammed into the island Sept. 20 and crippled its electrical grid. The blackout was caused by the failure of a 230-kilovolt line between the oil-fired Aguirre generating complex in Salinas and AES Corp.’s coal-fired power plant in Guayama, according to the utility. Prior to the outage, more than 44,000 customers were still without normal electric service lost after the storm. Some have been without electricity even longer as a result of Hurricane Irma, which brushed past Puerto Rico’s northeast coast as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 7 and left 1 million customers without power. One of them, university student Jonathan Rodriguez, 22, told the Associated Press: “I knew we’d be without power for some time, but not this long.” Rodriguez lives in the central mountain town of Corozal with two relatives who need electricity to survive. His grandmother depends on insulin and his aunt on equipment to prevent sleep apnea. Nearly every day after work, Rodriguez drives 20 minutes to the nearest gas station to buy fuel that keeps a donated generator running 24 hours a day. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing federal power restoration efforts, said it expects the entire island to have its power back by late May. But many remain pessimistic and a group of federal lawmakers has asked the US Federal Emergency Management Agency to extend the Corps’ assignment past May 18 to make sure all Puerto Ricans are once again connected to the fragile power grid. The Power Authority has been in bankruptcy since July with a debt of about $14 billion.

87,"Puerto Rico island-wide blackout caused by damaged transmission line, officials say",Elizabeth Zwirz,2018-04-18,"A blackout that affected the entire island of Puerto Rico on Wednesday was caused by a transmission line inadvertently taken out by an excavator, officials said.The transmission line was accidentally hit with the excavator while a private contractor was working to take out a collapsed tower during ongoing power restoration efforts in the U.S. territory, Justo Gonzalez, executive sub director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority (PREPA), said.The region was already suffering from an unstable power grid following Hurricane Maria, which barreled into the island seven months ago.Officials said earlier Wednesday that it could take 24 to 36 hours to fully restore power.DOWNED TREE IN PUERTO RICO KNOCKS OUT POWER TO ALMOST A MILLION CUSTOMERSThe first priority for restoration efforts included powering up hospitals, airports, banking centers and water pumping systems, officials said. The island’s largest hospital and main international airport maintained power through backup generators. After that, officials said they would focus on bringing power to businesses and homes.By the afternoon, power had been restored to five hospitals, Power Authority officials said, including the Cardiovascular Center, the Medical Sciences Campus, the Pediatric Medical Center, the San Pablo Hospital and the El Maestro Hospital.More than 800,000 people on the island also experienced an outage last week, after a tree collapsed onto a power line.In a statement from Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, he said PREPA needed to become ""a cutting-edge, modern and robust corporation"" and suggested that the company cut ties with the contractor responsible for Wednesday's outage.""Today, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) informed that a Cobra subcontractor damaged line 50700 while removing a collapsed tower with an excavator, causing a general power outage on the island,"" he said. ""I have suggested to the PREPA Board of Directors that they cancel the contract with the Cobra subcontractor who is directly responsible for this power outage. This is the second power failure that has affected the people of Puerto Rico in less than a week.""""I am committed to push for and enact trailblazing reforms that will ensure the transformation of our energy sector and give our people a state-of-the-art electric power system as we rebuild a stronger, more resilient Puerto Rico.""Fredyson Martinez, vice president of a union representing power company workers in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press that the two back-to-back outages were concerning.""That is not normal,"" he said.HURRICANE NAMES HARVEY, IRMA, MARIA AND NATE NOW ‘OFFICIALLY RETIRED’The outage is not expected to affect a major league baseball game being held on the island tonight, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said.

120,Excavator causes island-wide blackout on Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2018-04-18,"Puerto Rico was hit by an island-wide blackout Wednesday when an excavator removing a collapsed tower hit a power line, according to a report. Justo González, head of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told NBC News of the fiasco, which plunged the US territory of more than 3 million citizens into darkness almost seven months after Hurricane Maria struck the island. Utility spokesman Geraldo Quiñones López said there was “zero percent” power generation across the island, which has continued to struggle with an unstable power grid. “The breakdown affected the entire electrical system and generating plants,” he said, adding that the outage could last anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. The utility said it was prioritizing restoring power to hospitals, the international airport, and pumps for the sewage system and central banks. The outage comes two days after the utility published an online video celebrating the restoration of power to 97 percent of its customers, the Washington Post reported. The blackout was the first to cover the entire island since the Category 4 storm hit on Sept. 20. About 40,000 customers had still been without regular power as a result of the monster storm. The latest outage comes less than a week after 870,000 customers were left without electricity when a tree fell onto a major power line. According to economics research firm Rhodium Group, more than 3.4 billion hours of electricity have been lost on the island — marking the second-largest blackout in world history, CNN reported. The only blackout bigger than Puerto Rico’s was the one that resulted from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013. About 6.1 billion hours of power were lost after that storm. Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium who co-wrote the analysis with Peter Marsters, said the group studies the economic impacts of weather and climate events. “As we started looking at the scale of the blackout and try to put that in historical context, it became clear this was a record-breaking event and worthy of some attention and focus just from an electric standpoint,” Houser said. The Puerto Rico outage is already the worst in US history, beating the blackouts caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

121,Don’t let Puerto Rico’s creditors grab all the cash,"Desmond Lachman,, Antonio Weiss, Antonio Weiss",2018-04-17,"Puerto Rico bonds have been the best-performing fixed income investment thus far in 2018. Following the devastation of last year’s Hurricanes Maria and Irma, and the expected migration to the mainland of more than 10 percent of the island’s population, how can this be? The answer lies in the tens of billions of emergency reconstruction dollars appropriated by Congress, including $18 billion in housing grants alone, and in the dangerously optimistic forecasts of Puerto Rico’s own government. Prior to the hurricanes, the government’s fiscal plan, certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico established by Congress in 2016, assumed Puerto Rico could make debt service payments equal to 25 cents on the dollar. Now, notwithstanding the virtual destruction of its electrical grid, serious damage to other productive infrastructure, the shuttering of many of its businesses and the exodus of many workers and taxpayers, the government is happily forecasting that it could make payments up to 40 cents on the dollar. It’s doing so by unrealistically assuming that increased health care and reconstruction funds being appropriated by Congress will spur the kind of economic growth not seen on the island in more than a decade, even as it proposes steep cuts to government services and agencies that employ about one-quarter of its formal workforce. In making its latest economic forecast, the Puerto Rican government seems to be turning a blind eye not just to the island’s devastation but also to its dismal economic track record over the past decade, when its economy declined by 15 percent. A year ago, Puerto Rico’s certified forecast was that a prolonged period of budget austerity would cause the island’s economy to decline by more than 10 percent. Now it is predicting an output level by 2023 that is 10 percent higher than in the previous plan. The island’s infrastructure can be rebuilt with large-scale funding from Washington, but at best its productive capacity would only be restored to its pre-hurricane level. The influx of federal reconstruction dollars certainly could temporarily raise the rate of growth and pull up the level of output. Yet once recovery spending wanes, that effect should largely go into reverse — leaving in place long-standing problems like high unemployment and the highest poverty rate in the United States. Importantly, structural reforms such as changes to “ease of doing business” and labor laws cannot by any reasonable economic analysis be powerful enough in themselves to offset the loss of federal Medicaid funding, the potential drag from recent changes to the corporate income tax code and the eventual withdrawal of disaster aid. Yet both the government and oversight board rely on a range of controversial structural reforms to produce decades of sustained growth — a perilous projection. Yet another factor that would make Puerto Rico’s rosy economic scenario appear highly implausible is population flight to the mainland. The government itself is estimating that as a result of the hurricane, the island will lose more than 10 percent of its people over the next few years. The loss of that large a part of its economically active population is likely to result in a permanent downward shift in the island’s productive capacity. It’s our view that the public-sector debt, which consumes roughly 30 percent of the island’s tax revenues annually, must be written down to the maximum extent allowable under the law. This should be done in the interest of getting the island back on its feet and of avoiding a second debt restructuring. This week, the oversight board appointed by Congress meets to review the new fiscal plan. For the sake of the island and all US taxpayers, let us hope that its approach to the island’s daunting economic challenges is more prudent than that of the Puerto Rican government.

122,How spring breakers are helping Puerto Rico recover,"Nicole Lyn Pesce, Moneyish",2018-04-16,"Spring break has been giving Puerto Rico a much-needed cash break. Hurricane Maria devastated the US commonwealth seven months ago, killing at least 64 people officially — although some reports put the death toll closer to a 1,000 in the aftermath. The storm left the 3.4 million American citizens living there without power or running water. But Puerto Rico worked to welcome travelers back again in December since tourism contributes 10 percent of its gross domestic product. And it’s paid off, as a record-breaking surge of spring visitors is giving the 80,000 Puerto Ricans employed in the tourism industry a reason to smile. Inns and hotels across the Island reported close to 100 percent occupancy levels over the Passover/Easter weekend beginning March 30, according to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (PRTC). “Tourism has been up and running for months now and we are definitely roaring,” Carla Campos, acting executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, told Moneyish. More than 120 hotels, 4,000 restaurants, 13 golf courses and 15 casinos are open for business. Courtnie Nichols, 31, has been to Puerto Rico twice already this year for work and as a Red Cross volunteer, most recently returning on April 2. “There were so many people on the beaches Easter weekend,” Nichols, the owner of TravelBash boutique travel company, told Moneyish. “People were drinking and dancing in the street in San Juan and La Pacita. We couldn’t get into Pasta y Pueblo restaurant because they actually ran out of food! I was there the month before and thought I had found paradise — but now it looks like everyone else found it.” NFL star Devin Funchess, the Carolina Panthers wide receiver, spent almost a week there by himself in late February zip-lining in the El Yunque rainforest, sipping pina coladas in Old San Juan and snorkeling in the Caribbean. .“It was a spur-of-the-moment trip. It was after the season and my body was banged up and I was just looking for rest and relaxation,” he told Moneyish. “It was a good time. Everyone there was really friend and they’re working hard to rebuild.” Plus, “You don’t need a passport and it’s not expensive,” he added. In fact, TripAdvisor also just included Puerto Rico on its top five Caribbean islands where US travelers can take a weeklong trip for less than $2,000 per person, putting the tab at about $1,916 for a week, with hotel rooms averaging $244 a night. And the island’s tourism company is also anticipating a record-breaking 1.7 million cruise ship passengers to come through Puerto Rico this year, generating roughly $250 million in economic revenue. Campos said that Puerto Rico is “ready to enchant you,” which has become its marketing slogan. “We’ve had a real challenge with being able to relay this message that people shouldn’t be concerned about traveling to Puerto Rico. The top questions that we have are, ‘Is there power? Is there water? Do you have internet? Will my phone work?’” she said. “We recognize how much people have been concerned about what we went through … but that’s not to say that Puerto Rico isn’t rebounding.” Matthew and Ariane Ernst, who got married at La Concha resort on March 24, confessed they had cold feet about keeping their wedding on the island in the hurricane’s immediate aftermath. “We were in constant communication with our wedding planner and vendors, making sure first that they were doing okay. We even began to look for second venues up this way (in Manhattan)…but we wanted to stick with Puerto Rico,” Ernst, 30, told Moneyish. “We knew we would be bringing them a lot of money, not just for the wedding, but with our family and friends coming down and looking to have fun and spend money.” But their nups went off without a hitch. In fact, they were so enchanted with their wedding destination that they’re looking into buying a condo nearby to vacation in themselves and to rent out the rest of the year. “We want (Puerto Rico) to be at least a yearly trip!” he said. While Puerto Rico has hustled to get its tourism hubs back online, many areas have still been left in the dark. Seven months after the storm, more than 100,000 Puerto Ricans still don’t have power in what is now likely the second largest blackout in world history, according to data analytics group Rhodium Group and it’s the largest blackout in US history, losing 3.4 billion customer-hours of electricity service. “The traffic lights in certain places were blinking instead of working,” noted Nichols, who added that some locals she met who live in the mountains and around the rainforest only just got their power back recently. Some are still living off of generators. The massive storm damaged or leveled more than 470,000 houses, according to The Economist and also destroyed about 80 percent of the island’s agricultural crop, including coffee and banana plantations that will take years to grow back. But the US Department of Housing and Urban Development announced last week that it is giving about $18.5 billion in aid — the largest grant in HUD history — to repair and fortify houses, businesses and infrastructure wrecked by Hurricane Maria. And President Trump signed a $90 billion disaster aid package in February expected to give Puerto Rico about $50 billion in federal assistance over the next six years. “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda recorded the charity single “Almost Like Praying” with 22 music legends, including Rita Moreno, Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Luis Fonsi, Fat Joe, Gloria Estefan and Gina Rodriguez, with proceeds benefiting The Hispanic Federation. Those looking to continue aiding Puerto Rico in its recovery can donate through reputable charitable organizations such as the American Red Cross and The Hispanic Federation’s Unidos Disaster Relief Fund. But the tourism board is also encouraging visitors to come boost the local economy by spending money in the hotels, restaurants and local businesses. It’s reminiscent of New York City’s then-mayor Rudy Giuliani calling for visitors to come back after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, declaring: “The best thing you can do for our city is take in a Broadway show.” Amanda Duff, who once worked in public relations for Puerto Rican hotels including El Conquistador, a Waldorf Astoria Resort in Fajardo, as well as Condado Plaza Hilton in San Juan, told Moneyish that she returned to the island with her father in January. They took a road trip around the island and handed out school supplies, so she saw both the rapid recovery and the areas still struggling to rebuild. “I found that a lot of places had recovered quicker than I had expected, which was wonderful…specifically, Guanica (on the southern coast) was in amazing shape … but there’s still a long way to go,” she said. “It’s a tricky situation, but actually the best thing that people can do to pump up the economy is to dine in local restaurants, shop in local boutiques and stay in the hotels. And then you get a vacation out of it, as well, so it’s a win-win.” ",https://nypost.com/2018/04/16/how-spring-breakers-are-helping-puerto-rico-recover/,New York Post,Conservative
123,Puerto Rico to close 283 schools as enrollment plunges,Associated Press,2018-04-06,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s Department of Education announced Thursday that it will close 283 schools this summer following a sharp drop in enrollment amid the island’s long economic slump and the continued departure of families after Hurricane Maria. Education Secretary Julia Keleher said there would be no layoffs, with teachers and other employees being reassigned to other schools as part of a fiscal plan that aims to save the department some $150 million. The US territory has more than 1,100 public schools that serve 319,000 students. “We know it’s a difficult and painful process,” Keleher said. “Our children deserve the best education that we are capable of giving them taking into account Puerto Rico’s fiscal reality.” Keleher said that enrollment has dropped by more than 38,700 students since just last May and that nearly half of the schools are using only 60 percent of their capacity. After the closures, 828 public schools will remain operational. Keleher said she has invited mayors in the island’s 78 municipalities to propose new uses for the shuttered schools. The announcement of closures came two weeks after Gov. Ricardo Rossello signed a bill for implementing a charter schools pilot program in 10 percent of public schools and offering private school vouchers to 3 percent of students starting in 2019-2020 as part of an education overhaul. Aida Diaz, president of a union that represents some 30,000 teachers, said she and others would fight the closures. “The damage that the Secretary of Education is doing to children, youth and their parents is immeasurable,” Diaz said in a statement sent to the Associated Press. Yolanda Rosaly, an Education Department spokeswoman, did not immediately return a message for comment. Those who oppose the closures say they worry about transportation logistics and the needs of special education children. An estimated 30 percent of Puerto Rico students receive specialized education, twice the average on the US mainland. The drop in enrollment comes as roughly a half million people have fled Puerto Rico for the US mainland in the past decade during the long recession, including an estimated 135,000 since Hurricane Maria in September. Puerto Rico closed 150 schools from 2010 to 2015, and last year announced it would be closing another 179 schools.

124,Trump responded faster to Texas hurricane compared to Puerto Rico storm,Bob Fredericks,2018-03-27,"Team Trump responded faster and more effectively to help hurricane-ravaged Texas than it did in Puerto Rico after another mega-storm socked the island, according to a new investigation. In just six days after Hurricane Harvey swept across the Lone Star State, the US Northern Command had deployed 73 helicopters over Houston to save victims and deliver emergency supplies, Politico reported Tuesday, citing documents and interviews with more than 50 people. But it took at least three weeks after Hurricane Maria slammed the US territory before there were more than 70 choppers flying over Puerto Rico. And nine days after each hurricane, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved $141.8 million in aid to Harvey’s victims compared to a measly $6.2 million for victims of Maria. “We have the US Army and Marine Corps. We go anywhere, anytime we want in the world,” retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led the military’s relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, told the website. “And [in Puerto Rico] we didn’t use those assets the way they should have been used.” The investigation concluded that President Trump and his administration responded far more aggressively in Texas than in Puerto Rico, where many residents still face a long road to recovery. For example, nine days after Harvey struck the mainland, FEMA had dished out 5.1 million meals and 4.5 million liters of water, and distributed over 20,000 tarps to Houston, according to the report. In that same timeframe, the feds delivered just 1.6 million meals, 2.8 million liters of water and roughly 5,000 tarps to Puerto Rico. The federal government had 30,000 personnel in and around Houston during those same nine days, while just 10,000 were deployed nine days after Maria knocked out power and left tens of thousands without electricity or water and many thousands more homeless. And it took only 10 days for FEMA to approve permanent disaster work for Texas, compared to 43 days in Puerto Rico, the website reported. The president himself also appeared to be far more worried about Texans than he was about Puerto Ricans. The president came to Houston twice during the eight days after the storm, but didn’t arrive in Puerto Rico for 13 days. The tweeter-in-chief also focused more on the mainland than the island — firing off 24 tweets about Texas compared to eight about Puerto Rico, including some that disparaged the mayor of San Juan and the island’s residents, who are US citizens. “Wow — Now experts are calling #Harvey a once in 500 year flood! We have an all out effort going, and going well!” he wrote on Aug. 27, two days after the storm hit. “[They] want everything to be done for them and it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job,” he tweeted about Puerto Rico on Sept. 30, 10 days after Maria made landfall. “On Texas and Florida [during Hurricane Irma], the president was very vocal and engaged in the run-up to the storm. His messaging was frankly pretty good,” Jeremy Konyndyk, the former top disaster response official at USAID under ex-President Obama, told the website. “If you look at his public messaging on a comparable timeline around Puerto Rico, there’s virtually nothing. That sends a signal to the whole federal bureaucracy about how they should prioritize.” FEMA chief Brock Long defended the administration’s performance in Puerto Rico, telling the website that the agency was forced to take on a greater role in the response — echoing Trump’s comment that the island’s residents weren’t doing enough to help themselves. “We provided Puerto Rico the same, if not more support, as we have for all presidentially declared disasters across the nation. But an optimal response cannot rely on FEMA’s efforts alone,” he said. But Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, wasn’t buying Long’s line. “There is no doubt that Puerto Rico gets treated differently [than] a state. And there is no doubt that it has been true for the disaster response as well,” Rosselló told the website. “Our objective is to eradicate this notion of second-class citizenship in the United States, so that whenever a disaster hits — whether it’s Texas, Florida, New York or Puerto Rico — the federal government responds equally in all cases.” ",https://nypost.com/2018/03/27/trump-responded-faster-to-texas-hurricane-compared-to-puerto-rico-storm/,New York Post,Conservative
90,Puerto Rico governor blasts Congress over 'slow' pace of relief efforts,Bryan Llenas,2018-03-22,"The governor of Puerto Rico said Hurricane Maria disaster funds are taking too long to arrive on the island  and he’s blaming Congress.“We are being treated as second-class citizens,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello told Fox News. “Why is it the same process in Florida or in Texas takes a week  and in Puerto Rico it takes four months?”He said hurricane relief efforts in Texas after Hurricane Harvey and Florida after Hurricane Irma were vast and swift, but aid to Puerto Rico has arrived at a snail’s pace.Others on the island are also growing frustrated by relief efforts that they say are devastatingly slow to reach the island.On Tuesday nearly two dozen Puerto Rican activists were arrested in the U.S. Capitol demanding Congress provide more financial aid to the commonwealth. Puerto Rico claims it needs $94 billion in aid. Congress has appropriated $23 billion to Puerto Rico but less than $2 billion has been sent.“I want to see shovels in the ground, and things being built,” said Mike Byrne, federal coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I want to see houses being built to code and a power system under construction that will withstand a storm.""Byrne said FEMA’s efforts in Puerto Rico have been unprecedented  with $6 billion spent so far. About $16 million has gone to San Sebastian. The mayor there said the reason for the slow recovery was poor planning before the storm, and bad leadership afterward.“This town took control of its circumstances,” San Sebastian Mayor Javier Jimenez said, “and we lifted ourselves up.”Frustrated after not seeing power restored in a month, the town created volunteer brigades that included retired linemen to restore power and clear debris. He said the problem isn’t FEMA funding.“The governor should have acted with more urgency and he should have taken charge of the utility company,” Jimenez said, “immediately firing those who weren't doing their jobs.”On Tuesday, the governor appointed a new head of the Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, the bankrupt government-owned power utility widely blamed for the island’s failing electrical infrastructure.About 5,000 businesses have closed on the island in the last six months and are not expected to reopen.Johnny Ramos, president of a manufacturing company on the island, said his business has managed to survive the past six but he’s worried about others that are struggling. Another manufacturing company in the same industrial park as his business closed recently.“I cannot sit down,” said Ramos of CNC 2000 Inc., “and drop my hands and wait for the government I have to move.”On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin met with Governor Rossello to discuss the terms of a new $2 billion loan. Mnuchin has said he wants to ensure the money is serving the best interests of taxpayers, given that Puerto Rico is bankrupt.Bryan Llenas currently serves as a National Correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in New York.

125,FEMA ignored Puerto Rico in aftermath of Hurricane Maria,Associated Press,2018-03-21,"WASHINGTON — As hundreds of people stood in line for food and many went hungry during the days and weeks after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Walmart and local supermarkets threw out tons of spoiled meat, dairy and produce. Emails and text messages made public Tuesday in a letter sent by the top Democrat on the House oversight committee describe frantic efforts by officials at Walmart and the Puerto Rican government to get fuel for generators to prevent food from going bad. From the Federal Emergency Management Agency came only silence. Within a three-hour time span, Walmart officials were able to connect, through email and text messages, with a congressman’s office and local Puerto Rican government officials. They passed on their urgent request for help, just two days after the hurricane made landfall. Meanwhile, the letter states, FEMA remained unresponsive for days. The fuel issue is another window into difficulties the agency has faced in responding to Hurricane Maria, along with providing Puerto Ricans with thousands of tarps for the homeless and millions of meals for the hungry. Walmart ultimately disposed of an unclear amount of perishable foods and local supermarkets reported that they lost tens of thousands of dollars in perishable foods, according to the letter sent by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and Stacey Plaskett, the delegate from the US Virgin Islands. Their letter reiterates a request made to Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., in October for documents from the Department of Homeland Security related to FEMA’s preparation for and response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Gowdy’s office did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Maria, which made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, shut down ports, destroyed crops and disrupted the power grid, leaving supermarkets without electricity or the fuel to run their generators. Hundreds of thousands of people were also left without easy access to food. Two days after the hurricane, a senior Walmart official emailed Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., to ask for help keeping food refrigerated in the few stores they had been able to get up and running. “The problem is we’re running out of generator fuel and need help getting the Governor’s approval for me,” the Walmart official wrote. “Have you guys been in touch with anyone from FEMA that we can contact to help? We want to keep this food fresh for people.” Walmart had opened three facilities to support the public and had plans to bring more online, but the key to doing this was having power to run the operation and re-establish its supply chain, the Walmart official wrote. Roughly an hour after that first email, Gutierrez’s office forwarded the email to a Puerto Rican government official. And 12 minutes later, the Puerto Rican government official responded: “FYI I’m sitting with FEMA rep right now so we are taking care of this.” Walmart officials sent over a priority list of a dozen of their top stores — they operated 46 on the island — needing fuel to keep food from spoiling, in addition to their distribution center and home office. “Fuel at this point is becoming a key concern as we are less than 24 hours left in maintaining power in most facilities,” the Walmart official wrote. The message was forwarded by the Puerto Rican government official to a FEMA official 26 minutes later. But by Sunday, two days after initially reaching out, there was still no response from FEMA. The Puerto Rican government official texted Walmart that FEMA had not responded to numerous requests. “Did the hospitals get fuel?” the Walmart official asked. “I think so. But I can’t be sure. Our communication with FEMA on the specifics of certain things has been less than desired,” the Puerto Rican government official said. The following morning, the two exchanged messages again. The Puerto Rican government official informed Walmart that he had reached out to the island’s emergency management agency, which they hoped could help. “Our chief concern right now is with our distribution center,” the official text messaged back. “We might have two days worth of fuel left. It is critical that we keep that going in order to preserve our fresh inventory. If that goes down it could take weeks to replenish which would have a big negative impact on the island.” A week after the hurricane, still with no reply from FEMA, Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello personally reached out to FEMA to request emergency fuel for grocery stores to maintain perishable food supplies, the letter’s timeline states. A Puerto Rican government official informed FEMA officials in an email that “because of immediate threat to public health and safety, the Governor asked John Rabin (FEMA’s Acting Regional Administrator for Region II) at 8:10 a.m. this morning to have FEMA deliver fuel to all grocery and large retail immediately.” It’s unclear exactly how much food was lost or whether FEMA ultimately provided the emergency fuel. Responding to a request for comment, FEMA spokesman Daniel Llargues said in an email Tuesday that the agency is aware of the letter and has consistently worked with the committee and will continue to do so. “The protection of life and safety is our first priority in any response, including working closely with the government of Puerto Rico to support the fueling mission for critical infrastructure” such as hospitals and communications centers, Llargues said. Llargues said that FEMA has distributed more than 13 million gallons of fuel to date. He did not provide any timeline nor did he confirm the details in the letter. “It was tough at the beginning of that all the way through, it was tough, we didn’t have power,” Phillip Keene, a spokesman for Walmart, told The Associated Press. But he added, “We felt comfortable that people were acting in good faith.” Keene said he did not know how much food was thrown out and could not confirm details of the initial scramble for generator fuel. He said nearly all but a handful of stores were able to get back online within a matter of months, relatively quickly given the extent of the damage. Manuel Reyes, the executive vice president of the Puerto Rico Chamber of Marketing, Industry and Distribution of Food, told The Associated Press that the lack of fuel was a greater problem in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane due to logistics issues. Reyes, whose organization represents grocers, food distributors and food manufacturers on the island, said large quantities of food spoiled because businesses ran out of fuel for their generators and there was no distribution system for delivering more. He said many businesses paid up to four times the real cost of fuel when buying on the black market, sometimes competing with large hotels, housing complexes or department stores. “Since the beginning we made the local and federal governments aware of this, but as far as we know FEMA did not provide fuel or made trucks available to the private food distribution network,” Reyes said. “We believe they did provide some fuel to hospitals. We were forced to establish our own distribution system for our members using retrofitted waste-water trucks in order to keep some stores opened and food from going bad.” Reyes said that after three to four weeks, gas stations began to normalize and businesses could get fuel easier. “But by that time the emergency generators, which are not designed for continuous operation, began failing and we needed new ones or spare parts but few were available,” Reyes said. “No help with that either.” ",https://nypost.com/2018/03/21/fema-ignored-puerto-rico-in-aftermath-of-hurricane-maria/,New York Post,Conservative
91,Puerto Rico in 'fragile state' six months after Hurricane Maria,Bryan Llenas,2018-03-20,"Six months after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, about 100,000 Americans on the island are still without power, thousands of blue tarps cover damaged roofs on homes, and over 130,000 Puerto Ricans have moved away.“We’re at a fragile stability right now,” Michael Byrne, Puerto Rico’s federal coordinating officer for Federal Emergency Management Agency, told Fox News. “I’m sorry to have to say this but we’re still delivering food and water to some neighborhoods…we still have a lot of work to do as we move into the longer-term recovery.”On Monday alone, FEMA delivered 94,000 liters of water and 50,000 meals. The federal relief effort is almost out of phase one, power restoration and aid, and trying to progress into phase two, housing rebuilding efforts and long-term construction. While 93 percent of the island is no longer in the dark, crews are still trying to restore power in mountainous barrios, or neighborhoods, especially along the hardest hit southeastern region of the island. In fact, three FEMA generators are still providing power to the island’s electric grid.In Naguabo, Jose Martinez has been without power for six months. For the first three months, Martinez and his family took baths using an industrial bucket. They waited in long lines for food. Exasperating the situation  the family took turns carrying and taking care of his wife’s 82-year-old father, who was bedridden because of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.“I tell you what, it’s so hard,” he said with tears in his eyes. “I was depressed for four days and my wife was as well because we had our hands tied. You can do nothing.”On Sunday, Martinez’s lights finally came on. His home was a shelter for a dozen family members and friends during the last six months, each sharing supplies and food. They cheered as they anxiously watched AEP power crews from Ohio and Texas light up their block of about two dozen homes.“I feel so happy,” Martinez said. “I was here for Hurricane George. That was hard, too, but Maria… it was a demon man, it was a demon.”There are currently about 1,500 private utility workers on the island from 56 private utility companies all across the country, according to the Edison Electric Institute, which is coordinating the effort. The workers have been traveling to Puerto Rico to work 30-day stretches and 16-hour days.The 75 linemen from DTE Energy in Michigan have been met with cheers and meals. Everywhere they go, people who have little and have been in the dark for six months cook for them. The crews have used their own money to buy bicycles for kids and lights to put up at the local baseball field.“To be this resilient for six, seven months and then to be just grateful we’re here…we talk about it every night, some of the guys may say that they are rough tough linemen, but some of them go back to their rooms and cry,” said John Wagner, General Supervisor for DTE Energy.For many though, six months of no work and no power has forced them to leave Puerto Rico for good. More than 135,000 people have fled to the U.S. mainland, according to an estimate by Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York. On the mainland, nearly 7,000 families are in hotels and motels after FEMA extended the temporary shelter deadline until May.Roberto Martinez, 56, lost the roof of his home in Yabucoa, where Hurricane Maria made landfall. He is taking his wife of 31 years and their 27-year-old daughter to Indiana this summer. The craftsman made a living creating custom doors and windows but over the last six months he hasn’t been able to afford the generator or the gas to power up his tools. Martinez is leaving behind his 94-year-old mother and five siblings.“To have to abandon my grandmother, abandon my mother, my family after all these years together and to have make a decision like this now…it’s difficult,” Martinez said. “I have to have faith that I can do the work to lift my family up.”They are not alone, however. His wife, Awellda Ortiz, said she personally knows 30 people who have left since the storm. The family’s church of 400 has lost 25 percent of its parishioners.Back in San Juan, Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Roselló oversees the recovery efforts as tourists trickle back into the capital. At least 15 hotels are still closed and those open are overpopulated with recovery teams. Cab drivers told Fox News they are making about a third of what they made before the storm.“It’s going up but it’s still not at normal levels,” Roselló said. “Our expectation is that by summer air travel will be sustained to levels previous to the storm. The cruise liners have been starting to roll up.”Roselló told Fox News he wants to completely revamp and privatize PREPA, the government-owned utility company, which he blames for a woefully antiquated energy system. The governor continues to be frustrated by what he says is the lack of urgency from Washington D.C.Puerto Rico asked for $90 billion in aid. Congress appropriated $23 billion of that request but only about $1.27 billion has made its way to the island so far. The governor wants Congress to release the funds now, emphasizing that not one dollar has been spent on permanent public works projects.“We are being treated like second-class citizens,” Rosello said. “You’re talking about Puerto Rico that’s in fiscal distress, and on top of that we are waiting four months to get money when it took one or two weeks in Texas and Florida.”Recovery continues on the island, even as residents are mindful that hurricane season begins again in less than three months.“My biggest petition right now is  let’s just get service to the people,” the governor said. “Let’s rebuild what needs to be rebuilt, to be resilient and prepare for the next storm season.”Bryan Llenas currently serves as a National Correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in New York.

92,"Storm dealt Puerto Rico knockout blow after decades of fiscal failure, corruption",Barnini Chakraborty,2018-03-09,"Six months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, many leaders there are pointing the finger at Washington, but the scandal, corruption and waste that now plague the U.S. territory were around long before last summer's storm.Decades of dysfunction, mismanagement and embarrassing abuses of power left Puerto Rico reeling well before the storm delivered a knockout blow, say obervers. Enormous debt, absurd infrastructure projects and a tradition of corruption have hampered the commonwealth's ability to get off the canvas.“There’ve been so many problems that have built up year after year,” Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News. “It’s a tough situation.”“All these mayors were using borrowed money to build things that were underutilized.”   Reckless spending sprees by a revolving door of politicians have turned the commonwealth into a bloated bureaucracy that can’t pay its bills and yet enjoys the benefits of a welfare society without any of the responsibilities attached to it.Before Maria hit in September, Puerto Rico was already navigating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history at a whopping $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt.For years, the island blew through billions of dollars in borrowed money.Pricey and impractical infrastructure projects almost always got the go-ahead.“Every town in Puerto Rico has a new baseball park,"" Emilio Pantojas-Garcia, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, told Bloomberg News.  “All these mayors were using borrowed money to build things that were underutilized.”  One such project was a 1,000-seat performing-arts center in the small city of Humacao. The building was designed for big-budget Broadway-style performances. Instead, it was rarely used and ended up being the place where the occasional stand-up comic performs.The territory’s towering debt and mismanagement also led to less money being available for schools and hospitals.Then Maria hit and things on the island went from bad to catastrophic in the blink of an eye.Multiple cases of corruption and greed by local leaders, government officials and inexperienced contractors surfaced, shedding light on the toxicity that is still very much a part of everyday life in Puerto Rico.Those who can leave, often do.The government of Puerto Rico now estimates that by the end of the year, another 200,000 residents will have moved to the mainland.But for residents stuck in Puerto Rico, the future looks grim.“We’re used to it by now but that doesn’t make it right or fair,” Sunita Howell, a waitress in Old San Juan, told Fox News. Howell’s family, who lives in the Hato Rey neighborhood of the city, struggles daily.Howell says after Maria hit, her family was approached by someone offering to restore power to their home for $3,000.“I don’t have that kind of money,” she said. “Who has that here? You are supposed to be helping us not taking our money.”The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority - PREPA- has already suspended three employees without pay and says it is looking into another 25 reported cases of possible bribery in the days and weeks after Maria.PREPA confirmed to PBS that all of the cases involve field employees responsible for restoring power.El Vocero, a San Juan-based newspaper, said that some employees demanded up to $5,000 to reconnect power.PREPA’s director was forced out in November after the utility, the commonwealth’s sole electricity provider, failed to call for help from its mainland counterparts after the storm.Instead, PREPA granted a power-restoration contract to Whitefish Energy Holdings. It was a disaster of a deal and PREPA was forced to rescind the contract after public pressure.PREPA was also accused of stockpiling supplies badly needed to help with rebuilding after Maria.“The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,” Governor Ricardo Rossello, who is planning to sell PREPA to the private sector, said in a statement. “What we know today as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority does not work and cannot continue to operate like this.”PREPA’s problems are just one of several crises slowing down recovery on the island.The federal government recently awarded a $156 million contract to a one-person Atlanta-based company that was supposed to deliver 30 million meals to Puerto Rico. Owner Tiffany Brown, who had no disaster relief experience, got the gig but managed to deliver only 50,000 meals to the storm-ravaged island.There have been problems with the housing situation too and now, the island’s largest restoration contractor says it will pull out of Puerto Rico in the next few weeks after maxing out its $746 million contract.“It never ends,” Howell said. “Tomorrow I’ll wake up and there will be another scandal, another Whitefish.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/storm-dealt-puerto-rico-knockout-blow-after-decades-of-fiscal-failure-corruption,Fox,Conservative

I was throwing snowballs at him and he couldn’t understand why they disappeared when they hit the ground.”Yoda was flown to the US thanks to the work of Love of Satos, one of the multiple charities working to gain control over Puerto Rico’s huge stray dog population.

126,Explosion at electric station sends Puerto Rico into blackout,Associated Press,2018-02-11,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — An explosion and fire at an electric substation threw much of northern Puerto Rico into darkness late Sunday in a setback for the U.S. territory’s efforts to fully restore power more than five months after Hurricane Maria started the longest blackout in U.S. history. The island’s Electric Power Authority said several municipalities were without power, including parts of the capital, San Juan, but they were optimistic it could be restored within a day as they worked to repair a substation that controls voltage. The blast illustrated the challenges of restoring a power grid that was already crumbling before it was devastated by the Category 4 hurricane. In many cases, power workers are repairing equipment that should have long been replaced but remained online due to the power authority’s yearslong financial crisis. PREPA is worth roughly $4 billion, carries $9 billion in debt and has long been criticized for political patronage and inefficiency. It also struggled with frequent blackouts, including an island-wide outage in September 2016. It was not immediately known what caused Sunday’s fire, which was quickly extinguished. Officials said the explosion knocked two other substations offline and caused a total loss of 400 megawatts worth of generation. “We are trying to restore that as quickly as possible,” the company said. Heavy black smoke billowed from the substation as neighbors in the area described on social media seeing the sky turn orange following a loud explosion. San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz tweeted that no injuries had been reported and that power had been restored in some areas of the city. The blackout comes as more than 400,000 power customers remain in the dark more than five months after Hurricane Maria. The storm destroyed two-thirds of the island’s power distribution system and caused up to an estimated $94 billion in damage. Puerto Rico’s governor announced last month that he plans to privatize the state-owned power company, which relies on infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average. It would be the largest restructuring of a public entity in U.S. history. One week after his announcement, a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances asked that a judge authorize a loan of up to $1.3 billion so the power company can keep operating. The board said the company could see an estimated $1.2 billion loss in revenue in the first six months after Hurricane Maria.

128,NYC wine bar employees plan trip to help Puerto Rico,John Aidan Byrne,2018-01-13,"Packing for their annual corporate retreat later this month, chefs, managers, directors and other staff at City Winery, the one-of-a-kind wine bar and music venue on Varick Street, are filling their duffle bags with ground coffee, shovels, extension cords, dehydrated milk, diapers and other supplies. Breaking with tradition, this annual “base camp” will forgo more laid-back sun-splashed locales for Puerto Rico, where some 120 City Winery employees nationwide will assist in rebuilding the local economy in the wake of Hurricane Maria. “Every year we have been taking our key leadership for an offsite look at our business and come back with a renewed understanding what we are doing,” City Winery’s founder and chief executive, Michael Dorf, told The Post. “This year’s theme is to remind ourselves how important giving back is to our corporate culture and company DNA.” The City Winery crew will camp at La Concha in San Juan and go straight to work for more than three days soon after the plane touches down. Dorf and the team will build a permanent performance stage equipped with a Meyer Sound system on the storm-ravaged island. They are not alone. Chef Juan Jose Cuevas of Restaurant 1919 at Puerto Rico’s Condado Vanderbilt Hotel is teaming with City Winery to host a celebration party for the local community during the retreat.

100,University of Illinois expert helps Puerto Rico libraries,,2018-01-05,"CHAMPAIGN, Ill.  A University of Illinois expert is helping libraries in Puerto Rico assess and repair collections that were damaged by Hurricane Maria.Miriam Centeno is the collections care coordinator at the University of Illinois Library. She's also a Puerto Rico native. She'll spend two weeks as a consultant at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez, the News-Gazette reported .The university's library sustained heavy water damage from the September hurricane. The collections themselves weren't damaged by water, but by mold from the building going weeks without electricity and air conditioning.""From what I hear, the climate conditions are pretty bad,"" Centeno said. ""The water didn't hit the books, which is a miracle. It damaged some parts of the library that were more like reading areas. But the problem is the mold that permeates the entire environment.""Centeno said she talked with two librarians in Mayaguez who put together a proposal for a disaster recovery grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The $30,000 grant will pay for supplies such as cleaning materials, vacuums with high-efficiency filters, dehumidifiers, respirators for staff who will clean, and acid-free storage.Centeno will lead a program to teach library staff members how to assess and clear their collections, put damaged materials in better storage and develop disaster preparedness plans.""We're so vulnerable right now,"" she said. ""There's less than a year to go to the next hurricane season.""She hopes to provide preservation training to at least two other sites.Centeno has been working with a National Heritage Responder team partnering with the Library of Congress and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make a database of cultural institutions in Puerto Rico that need help with disaster recovery. She also recommended the Mayaguez campus help conduct an island-wide survey of libraries and cultural institutions.""Libraries are a place of refuge for people during disasters,"" she said. ""Libraries and museums give people a place to cope and get away from the stress.""___Information from: The News-Gazette, http://www.news-gazette.com",https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-of-illinois-expert-helps-puerto-rico-libraries,Fox,Conservative

131,Hurricane death toll in Puerto Rico likely higher than official count,Natalie O'Neill,2017-12-08,"More than 1,000 people died in Puerto Rico in the weeks after Hurricane Maria — meaning the storm’s death toll is likely much higher than the official tally, new data reveals. There were at least 1,065 fatalities on the water-and-electricity-starved island in the 42 days after the storm struck on Sept. 20, according to a report released by The Center for Investigative Journalism on Thursday. At least 985 more people died in the country during September and October 2017 than the same time period last year, according to the data. Puerto Rican officials have said the number of people who died as a result of the natural disaster is 62. The most people died on Sept. 25 — the same day Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rosselló warned the country was on the brink of a mass exodus. There were a total of 135 fatalities on that day, compared to 75 last year. Overall, more than 100,000 people have fled the storm-ravaged island this year, according to The City University of New York’s Center for Puerto Rican Studies. In September, the island’s average daily death rate spiked by 43 percent — and soared as high as 80 percent in the five days after the storm struck, according to the report. In October, the death toll increased by 23 percent. The biggest spike in deaths hit people between the ages between 70 and 79 in September. Many of them died in hospitals and nursing homes from preexisting conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, kidney disease, and respiratory diseases as temperatures hit 90 degrees. In October, the biggest increase in fatalities hit people over the age 90, according to the report. But the death rate also soared among people in their 30s and 40s. Fatalities among people ages 30 to 39 years old increased by 36 percent in October. The rate among people 40 to 49 years old spiked 23.3 percent, according to the report. On Sept. 29, Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary, Héctor Pesquera, said he expected the death toll to increase — but not by much. “Will it go up? I am pretty sure it will go up,” he said in a statement. “It won’t double or triple. It’s not like an earthquake where you have a building and you don’t know whether there were 20 in the building or 300 in the building until you get all the rubble out.” Hurricane Maria was the tenth-most powerful Atlantic hurricane and the most intense tropical cyclone so-far in 2017.

Whitefish Energy has been promptly turning over payments to subcontractors once PREPA pays invoices for such work, and in some instances paying subcontractors before Whitefish Energy receives payment from PREPA, but the outstanding invoices for work performed in October has made it impossible to continue in this manner.”Read more at WashingtonExaminer.com",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whitefish-stops-work-in-puerto-rico-after-not-receiving-payment,Fox,Conservative

But the company, Bronze Star LLC, never delivered those urgently needed supplies. According to an exclusive report by the Associated Press report, the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the contracts this month, without paying any money, and re-started the process to supply more tarps for the US territory. The original effort took nearly four weeks between the day FEMA awarded the contracts to Bronze Star, which was formed in August, and the day it canceled them, tying up millions in disaster relief funds. Thousands of Puerto Ricans remain homeless, and many complain the federal government is taking too long to install tarps.

Clinton arrived with medical supplies and solar energy equipment donated by the Clinton Foundation, which has already shipped 76 tons of medicine and medical equipment since the storm hit on Sept. 20. Clinton also visited health clinics and the island’s largest shelter with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello. He planned to meet with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and other officials later Monday. Rossello said Clinton’s visit will help people realize that Puerto Rico still needs relief supplies more than two months after the hurricane hit. “It’s important to have him here because he has a vision of how to emerge from the emergency phase, establish normalcy and begin to rebuild,” Rossello said. The hurricane killed at least 55 people and caused up to an estimated $95 billion in damage. More than 20 of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities are still without power, and more than 140,000 people have fled for the U.S. mainland.

104,Florida struggles to accommodate Puerto Rico hurricane victims fleeing island in droves,Steve Harrigan,2017-11-17,"KISSIMMEE, Fla.  The old, without medicine, are coming. The young, without classrooms, are coming. And those in between are coming, too.Two months after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, residents of the island are heading to Florida in seemingly unprecedented numbers. Since the hurricane battered the U.S. territory on Sept. 20, at least 164,000 residents of the island have fled to the Sunshine State, according to the Florida’s Division of Emergency Management.The long-term impact of that massive influx is still unclear, but already cities like Orlando and Miami are feeling the squeeze. The Mariel boatlift in 1980, when 125,000 Cubans crowded into boats to Miami, dramatically reshaped the political and cultural landscape of the state. Demographers are still trying to figure out the impact of this year’s surge.One-stop shopping centers at Miami International Airport and in Orlando have been set up to provide housing, medical care, food, and employment. The surge is straining local resources, including charities like Latino Leadership in Orlando, a local non-profit trying to help the new arrivals find jobs and housing.The flood of arrivals is also affecting schools, where dozens of new students without transcripts arrive each day, said Osceola County Schools Superintendent Debra Pace.

134,Puerto Rico asks for $94 billion in hurricane aftermath,Associated Press,2017-11-14,"WASHINGTON — Puerto Rico’s governor on Monday asked the federal government for $94.4 billion as the island struggles to recover from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Maria, with much of the U.S. territory without power and thousands still homeless. Ricardo Rosello also urged Congress to adopt a tax overhaul plan that addresses Puerto Rico’s specific needs to avoid an exodus of the companies that currently generate 42 percent of the island’s gross domestic product. The governor said during a news conference that he will formally make his request to the White House and Congress, along with a report with a detailed assessment of damage. The governor is seeking $46 billion to restore housing through the Community Development Block Grant program, $30 billion within the Federal Emergency Management Agency to recover critical infrastructure and $17.9 billion in other federal grant programs for long-term recovery. So far, Congress has approved nearly $5 billion in aid for Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria caused widespread damage on Sept. 20 and the worst blackout in U.S. history. The request from Puerto Rico surpasses the $61 billion that Texas is pursuing from the federal government for infrastructure improvements. “This is a transformative moment in the history of Puerto Rico,” Rosello wrote to President Donald Trump. “We recognize that your leadership, along with that of leaders from both parties, will be essential to our recovery, and the future economic and fiscal health of the island.” Rosello announced that his team will create a portal that will allow the public to track the status of recovery and funds. That is part of an effort to placate concerns after the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority selected Whitefish Energy Holdings to help rebuild the island’s electrical system, even though it had just two employees when the hurricane struck. The contract was canceled on Oct. 29 amid bipartisan criticism from members of Congress and a request by Rossello to void the deal. On the tax front, Rosello asked Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from a proposed excise tax of 20 percent for merchandise manufactured abroad because products manufactured in Puerto Rico and imported into the U.S. should be treated as domestic products. Republicans hope to finalize a tax overhaul by Christmas and send the legislation to Trump for his signature. “If the goal of the tax reform is to create American jobs, then Puerto Rico must be taken into consideration,” the governor said. “If not, it would end up being worst than how it is today.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/11/14/puerto-rico-asks-for-94-billion-in-hurricane-aftermath/,New York Post,Conservative
135,Why FEMA has paid Puerto Rico just $121K in wake of Hurricane Maria,Bob Fredericks,2017-11-03,"FEMA has paid $2.8 billion in federal flood-insurance cash to people impacted by Hurricane Harvey and $179 million to those hit by Hurricane Irma — but just a measly $121,000 to people in areas devastated by Hurricane Maria, a new report said Friday. The reason, according to an Axios report, is that few people in Puerto Rico, which bore the brunt of Maria, even have flood insurance. And the National Flood Insurance Program isn’t even available on much of the island. Buying federal flood insurance requires municipalities and counties to maintain reasonable flood standards, which may cost too much for the island.

136,FBI probes shady Puerto Rico power contract,Mark Moore,2017-10-30,"The FBI has launched an investigation into the $300 million contract awarded to a tiny Montana company to ​help rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid, it was reported Monday. Agents with the bureau’s San Juan office are looking into the agreement signed between the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority​ and Whitefish Energy Holdings, The Wall Street Journal reported. Questions about the deal emerged last week when news reports revealed that Whitefish, which is based in the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, won a no-bid contract with PREPA even though it only had two employees when Hurricane Maria made landfall on Sept. 20. Zinke has said he had “absolutely nothing to do” with the contract. “While Whitefish is not aware of any such investigation, Whitefish is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or investigation,” a Whitefish spokesman said. “The procurement of the PREPA contract was at all times fully appropriate.” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Sunday he was canceling the deal even though about 70 percent of the island is still without power after the hurricane, noting the controversy has become a distraction. The governor “has been clear: there should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” a Rosselló spokeswoman said. Rosselló has asked for utility crews in New York and Florida to help restore power though existing mutual aid agreements that PREPA rejected to hire Whitefish. The company has hired a lobbyist to plead its case in the halls of Congress, retaining former Democratic Rep. Dennis Cardoza of California, Politico reported Monday.

137,Puerto Rico governor wants to nix no-name firm’s $300M contract,Carl Campanile,2017-10-29,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosello moved Sunday to cancel the $300​ million Whitefish Energy hurricane recovery contract amid scrutiny of the ​fledgling ​Montana company. He said his government has the right to cancel the project through an escape clause in the contract. “We’re invoking that cancellation clause… There’s some work that needs to be finished, but I am invoking that cancellation clause,” he said at a press conference. “There cannot be any kind of distraction that alters the commitment to restore electrical power as soon as possible in Puerto Rico,” Rossello said, adding that at least $8 million has been paid to Whitefish so far. ​The announcement by Rossello comes as federal legislators seek to investigate the contract awarded to the small company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown. Whitefish was awarded a $300 million contract to help rebuild power lines in Puerto Rico following the damage wrought by Hurricane Maria. But critics questioned the firm’s ability to do the work. The two-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit, but it has since hired more than 300 workers. Rosello last week ordered an inspector general investigation into the contracting process.​ For his part, Zinke insisted his relationship with Whitefish’s CEO did not influence the decision to award the company the massive contract. Rossellos’s announcement comes as federal legislators seek to investigate why the contract was awarded to the small company from Zinke’s hometown.​ The Federal Emergency Management Agency ​also ​raised concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the prices were reasonable.​​ Rossello requested that power crews from New York and Florida come to help restore power in Puerto Rico. Gov. Cuomo has dispatched New York State emergency workers to aid the island the past few weeks and has personally visited to survey the damage. Meanwhile Rossello also slammed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for not meeting its goals. The agency could not be immediately reached for comment. Roughly 70 percent of the island remains without power more than a month after Hurricane Maria struck the U.S. territory on Sept. 20. Power company Director Ricardo Ramos has said that Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority reached a deal with Whitefish just days before the hurricane struck. He also said that FEMA had approved of the deal, something the agency has denied. FEMA said last week that it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the power company for money to cover repairs to the island’s electrical system. The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, “The federal government is not a party to this contract.” The move by Rossello comes days after Whitefish got into a public spat on Twitter with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz after she slammed the “alarming” nature of the contract. Whitefish Energy subsequently apologized.​ Unlike other Puerto Rican politicians who have lambasted the Trump Administration’s handling of recovery efforts, Rossello has been more measured in his criticism and has sought to maintain cordial ties to the president to bolster recovery efforts.

138,Puerto Rico’s power chief scraps $300M Whitefish contract,Carl Campanile,2017-10-29,"The head of Puerto Rico’s power company announced Sunday that he’s cancelling a $300 million contract with the Montana-based Whitefish Energy firm. Power company director Ricardo Ramos said he acceded to a demand by the territory’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, who made the call for action in a rare Sunday morning press conference. Ramos says the cancellation will delay work by 10 to 12 weeks. The contract for the small company has come under fire as it is located in the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and at the time Hurricane Maria hit only had two employees. The circumstances surrounding how Whitefish obtained the contract from Puerto Rico’s power company is now the subject of federal audits. About 70 percent of the island remains without power more than a month after Maria, which dealt a direct hit to the island just days after Hurricane Irma. “There cannot be any kind of distraction that alters the commitment to restore electrical power as soon as possible,” Rosselló said, adding that at least $8 million has been paid to Whitefish so far. The Federal Emergency Management Agency raised concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the prices were reasonable. A Whitefish contract obtained by the Associated Press found that the deal included $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic. Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland. Whitefish said it was “disappointed” with the nullification, adding that “the decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve — to have the power restored quickly.” Rosselló requested that power crews from New York and Florida come to help restore power in Puerto Rico. Gov. Cuomo has twice visited the island and dispatched hundreds of New York state emergency workers to aid the commonwealth over the past few weeks. Rosselló also slammed the US Army Corps of Engineers for not meeting its goals. The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and its contractors have only 404 brigades on the island, Rosselló said, and the USACE has seven. He said he was seeking more than 1,000 by Nov. 8. Cuomo praised Rosselló for making a “very smart move,” because it’s better to get help from numerous state governments instead of relying heavily on one contractor. States get reimbursed by the federal government for aiding other states or territories deemed a disaster area. Zinke has insisted his relationship with Whitefish did not influence the decision to award the massive contract.

139,Thousands have fled Puerto Rico for Florida since Hurricane Maria,Mark Moore,2017-10-26,"More than 73,000 of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents have fled to Florida since Hurricane Maria struck the Caribbean island. “Since October 3, 2017, more than 73,000 individuals arrived in Florida from Puerto Rico through Miami International Airport, Orlando International Airport and the Everglades Port,” Gov. Rick Scott’s office said in a statement. Although Maria struck Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it didn’t begin counting until Oct. 3 because that’s when Florida was declared a state of emergency so it could handle the expected effects of the influx of evacuees. The state has also served more than 15,000 Puerto Ricans at disaster relief centers at those sites. Scott also said the State Emergency Response Team is working with private partners to provide transport vessels and essential services and supplies to the storm-ravaged island. Nearly five weeks after Maria made landfall, the situation in Puerto Rico, a US commonwealth, remains dire. More than three-quarters of people are without electricity and 22 percent are still without running water. Florida lawmakers have been discussing the financial hit the state has taken by the evacuees and are calling for additional spending for housing, schools and hospitals. “They are United States citizens, they are our brothers and sisters,” ​Sen. Jack Latvala​, the chairman of the ​Florida Senate Appropriations Committee, said during an emotion appeal to his colleagues on Wednesday. “The question, the only question that we’re raising is that it needs to be a collective decision entered into by the legislature as well as the governor.” With Post Wires ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/26/thousands-have-fled-puerto-rico-for-florida-since-hurricane-maria/,New York Post,Conservative

Most residents remain without electricity and Cuomo told reporters before taking off from JFK airport that water is a major problem as well. “They’re drinking water that may be poison,” he said. The state has already sent more than 3,000 pallets of goods to the US territory. Delta airlines donated the seats for Thursday’s flight for Cuomo and his aides, which included state police. The governor, who is weighing a possible run for the White House in 2020, blasted President Trump for not doing more for Puerto Rico. “Washington is talking about how long emergency troops and FEMA can stay there,” he said. “There have been suggestions from our federal government that you know ‘Well, we can’t stay there forever. In New York, we have the exact opposite attitude. When you’re talking about the people of Puerto Rico, you’re talking about Americans. I don’t know how the president or anyone else can be talking about leaving… when you still have millions of people in need of urgent help.” ","https://nypost.com/2017/10/26/cuomo-is-heading-back-to-puerto-rico/

106,’Largest blackout in American history’ ensues in Maria’s aftermath as Puerto Rico struggles to restore power,,2017-10-26,"Roughly 75 percent of U.S. territory Puerto Rico's 3.4 million residents still lack electricity, over a month has gone by since the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria.A new study found that based on the available data, Hurricane Maria has caused the largest blackout in American history.Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló set a goal to restore power to half of all customers by Nov. 15 and 95 percent by Dec. 15.If Puerto Rico can meet this aggressive timeline and a similar restoration pathway is achieved in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Maria will have resulted in more than 2 billion lost customer hours in total, according to the study.That is three times the impact of Hurricane Sandy or the 2003 Northeast Blackout, the study reads. Prior to the storm, Puerto Rico's power system was unstable. The island's electric utility filed for bankruptcy in July, and officials had said the system was ""vulnerable and fragile"" and in urgent need of maintenance, sources told CNN.Puerto Rico's utility quasi-public power utility, PREPA, signed a $300 million deal with a small Montana company, Whitefish Energy, to help repair the island's ravaged power grid.Whitefish was awarded the deal without a competitive bidding process, drawing criticism from many U.S. lawmakers.The company had just two full-time employees and was established only two years ago, which caused many lawmakers to suggest that cheaper and more established options might have been available.In previous cases, such as recently in Texas and Florida, ""mutual aid"" agreements helped U.S. utilities to recover quickly from natural disasters. It is an unusual decision to hire a tiny-for-profit company, according to The Washington Post.Despite the heavy scrutiny from Congress, Rosselló defended the island's decision in a statement on Tuesday.“Of those (contractors) who met the requirements and aggressive schedules to bring brigades, one was asking for a substantial amount of money - which PREPA had no liquidity for - and another did not require it,” Rosselló said. “That other one is Whitefish.”However, Rosselló said in a tweet on Wednesday that he asked the Office of the Inspector General to conduct a review of the contracting process of Whitefish Energy.Meanwhile, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz voiced her own criticism of Whitefish, saying the contract should be ""voided right away"" and calling the deal ""alarming"" in an interview with Yahoo News on Wednesday.The criticism fueled a twitter spat between Cruz and Whitefish. Whitefish later apologized for their response to Cruz in a tweet on Wednesday night.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/largest-blackout-in-american-history-ensues-in-marias-aftermath-as-puerto-rico-struggles-to-restore-power,Fox,Conservative
141,No-name firm with Zinke ties lands $300M Puerto Rico power contract,Mark Moore,2017-10-24,"A tiny Montana company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown inked a $300 million contract to help restore electrical power on Puerto Rico, according to a report Tuesday. Whitefish Energy, which only had two employees when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, now has 280 workers on the island, the majority of whom are subcontractors, the Washington Post reported. The contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is the largest issued so far in the relief effort, the report said. PREPA decided to hire Whitefish instead of activating “mutual aid” arrangements it has with other utilities, understandings typically used among US power companies to hasten recovery efforts from natural disasters, such as the recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida. A month after Maria hit, about three-quarters of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents still are without power. A former official at the Energy Department said the selection of Whitefish is “odd.” “The fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out, it is at least odd why [the utility] would go to Whitefish,” Susan F. Tierney, a former senior official at the Energy Department and state regulatory agencies, told the newspaper. “I’m scratching my head wondering how it all adds up.” Ricardo Ramos, PREPA’s executive director, has told reporters that Whitefish was chosen because it was the first company “available to arrive and they were the ones that first accepted the terms and conditions” of the authority. “The doubts that have been raised about Whitefish, from my point of view, are completely unfounded,” he said. Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames dismissed the criticisms as “carping.” “So the carping by others is unfounded, and we stand by our work and our commitment to the people of Puerto Rico,” he told the Washington Post. Zinke’s office said the secretary knows Whitefish’s top executive, but that’s not unusual in a town with a population of a little more than 7,000 people. “Everybody knows everybody,” Zinke’s office said in an email. It added that Zinke played no role in getting the contract. The House Committee on Natural Resources is looking into PREPA’s hiring of Whitefish.

Dozens of adorable pooches were rescued from hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico and are up for adoption in the Big Apple, animal shelter sources said Sunday. A total of 28 dogs — some of which were abandoned during the natural disaster— are up for grabs at Animal Haven on the Lower East Side, said Tiffany Lacey, executive director of the shelter. “These animals are in dire need. It’s life or death down there,” Lacey urged. “Come in and adopt because you’re gonna be helping.” The furry survivors were rescued from the island by charter plane and brought to the no-kill shelter on Saturday night, according to Lacy. The furry survivors include a pure-bred Shih Tzu, Great Dane and a hound, which are available for adoption beginning Tuesday. Some of the dogs were left at shelters by owners in the aftermath of the hurricane. Others were strays before the storm struck. The raging storm worsened the country’s epidemic of homeless and starving pups. “Even without a natural disaster, it is overwhelming. There’s a very high euthanasia rate. A lot of people are dumping animals,” Lacey said. A total of 53 dogs were saved by the animal rescue group The Sato Project. Some were brought to shelters elsewhere in the United States.

143,Schumer calls on Trump to appoint Puerto Rico recovery chief,"Mark Moore, Gina Daidone",2017-10-22,"Sen. Chuck Schumer on Sunday called on President Trump to appoint a recovery chief to oversee relief efforts for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. The New York Democrat said the “chief executive of response and recovery” would have direct access to the president, cabinet​ secretaries​, Congress​ members​ ​and ​Puerto Rico ​government officials ​to coordinate recovery work. “It’s been more than a month since Maria, but 80 percent of the lights in Puerto Rico are still out, and American citizens are unsure about where their next glass of clean water will come from — this is just unconscionable and demands new action,” said Schumer, who was joined at the news conference by Reps. Nydia M. Velazquez and Jose Serrano​, Democrats from New York.​ ​The chief executive would coordinate​ emergency response efforts between US government agencies — including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Energy and the Treasury Department — and ensure cities and towns in Puerto Rico receive the necessary resources and support. The person would also oversee repairing and restoring the electric grid and monitor contracts to make sure there is no “waste, fraud, or abuse.” Schumer blasted the Trump administration’s recovery effort after Hurricane Maria slammed into the US commonwealth Sept. 20 as “disorganized, slow-footed and mismanaged” and said the island is in the midst of a “humanitarian crisis.” The death toll has reached 49 and dozens are missing. Beyond the lack of drinking water and persistent power outages that have hobbled the country’s hospitals, Schumer said there is a severe shortage of medication and health care supplies that is putting thousands more at risk. ​Gov. Ricardo Rossello met with Trump at the White House last Thursday to make his case for more federal help for the 3.4 million residents of Puerto Rico, saying “the reality is we still need to do more.” The president, asked by reporters to score his administration’s response to Maria, said, “it’s a 10.” Schumer said Trump’s comments are an insult ​”to people of good will and humanity anywhere.” “You don’t have to be an expert on Puerto Rico, all you have to do is look at the pictures and hear the reports, people drinking sewage because they don’t have water, hospitals worried that their patients will die because they are on some faulty old generator and they don’t have electricity​,” Schumer said.​ Vela​z​quez said the US government is failing the people of Puerto Rico. “There is no way to sugarcoat it, by every metrics, it is abundantly and tragically clear that the response to Maria has been ineffective, slow, and weak​,” she said. “​And the result is that our fellow citizens, American citizens are suffering and dying.” “The whole world is watching what is happening in Puerto Rico​,” she said.​ Serrano said the situation is “shameful.” “You’re hearing the horror stories​.​​ … How can ​A​merican citizens anywhere under the ​A​merican flag be in a situation where they’re drinking sewage water​,” he said. “How shameful for us and how inhumane; and this can be turned around. We don’t need paper towels being thrown at people, we don’t need comments about getting trucks through the ocean, we don’t need any of that, what we need is a coordinated effort.” “I hope the president stops tweeting and starts thinking​,​”​ he added.​ ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/22/schumer-calls-on-trump-to-appoint-puerto-rico-recovery-chief/,New York Post,Conservative

146,Trump gives himself a perfect ‘10’ for hurricane response in Puerto Rico,Mark Moore,2017-10-19,"President Trump said​ ​he would give his administration a perfect “10” for its response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, despite widespread power outages and the lack of basic services like running water​. “I would give myself a 10,” Trump​ ​said Thursday as he sat next to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello​,​ because “we have provided so much, so fast.” ​“I’d say it was probably the most difficult when you talk about relief, when you talk about search, when you talk about all of the different levels, and even when you talk about lives saved, Trump said during the White House meeting. “You look at the number. I mean, this was — I think it was worse than Katrina.” Rossello, who was lobbying for more assistance from Washington four weeks after Hurricane Maria slammed into the US commonwealth​​, sidestepped Trump’s request to rate his response. Trump asked, “Did we do a good job?” Rossello replied, “You responded immediately, sir.” The two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico last month — first Irma then Maria — were “in many ways worse than anything people have ever seen,” Trump said. “They got hit by a category 4. Grazed. But grazed about, you know, a big portion of the island,” the president said. “But it was grazed. The rest of it hit Florida, as you know. But that was bad. But then they got hit dead center … by a category 5. … It hit right through the middle of the island, right through the middle of Puerto Rico. There’s never been anything like that. I give ourselves a 10.” Trump was faulted for his administration’s sluggish response to provide relief, especially when compared to the aid operations after hurricanes hit Florida and Texas, and for his comments that emergency personnel couldn’t stay on Puerto Rico indefinitely. Responding to upbeat comments from Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said, “This is not a good news story, this is a people are dying story.” Nearly a month after Maria made landfall, only 22 percent of the island’s 3.4 million residents have electricity and 72 percent have access to clean water. But about 78 percent of the hospitals are open, although electric service is still unreliable. Trump said despite the efforts of emergency personnel, getting help to the residents was a logistical nightmare because the storm wrecked infrastructure and many of the roads were blocked with debris from the storm. Remarking on Puerto Rico’s $74 billion in debt, Trump said the government would work out a plan for it to pay back any loans during the rebuilding process. “I will say that I have given my blessing to Congress and Congress is working with you and your representatives on coming up with a plan and a payment plan and how it’s all going to be funded,” he said.

145,Governor of Puerto Rico wants ‘equal treatment’ from Trump,Mark Moore,2017-10-19,"The governor of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico said he’ll tell President Trump when he meets with him later Thursday that “we need equal treatment” like other US citizens who are recovering from the destruction of recent storms. “Recognizing that we’re in this together – US citizens in Texas, US citizens in Florida, US citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands – we need equal treatment,” said Gov. Ricardo Rossello. “We need all the resources so we can get out of the emergency and of course the resources to rebuild.” Four weeks after Hurricane Maria crashed into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, the island is still struggling to recover. Rossello will meet with Trump who has been criticized for his administration’s sluggish response to provide aid, compared to relief efforts in Florida and Texas. Trump also feuded with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and accused her of “poor leadership” after she questioned the pace of relief efforts last month. And Trump drew fire when he suggested that emergency personnel couldn’t remain in Puerto Rico indefinitely. “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” Trump said on Twitter last week.

147,Private security mercenaries are now moving into Puerto Rico,"Larry Celona, Danika Fears",2017-10-16,"The situation is so bad in Puerto Rico that a private security firm formerly known as Blackwater has fielded several requests to send employees to the island — and there are already guards roaming around with long guns on the streets of San Juan. US security firm Academi, formerly called Blackwater, has received at least five different requests for help, including one from Federal Protective Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. “We’ve been invited to bid armed and unarmed security of fuel and water, but have not received responses,” said Paul Donahue, CEO of Constellis, Academi’s parent company. “The top two concerns as reported to us are the need for security of fuel (for gas stations and for generators so businesses can operate), and for humanitarian support, i.e. water distribution.” A job listing on the Constellis Web site says they’re looking for “security professionals to deploy to Puerto Rico to provide humanitarian and armed security services.” One of the tasks would be dealing “tactfully with the general public,” it says. The Whitestone Group, another U.S. security company, posted an online ad on Sept. 29 seeking “retired officers with gun licenses for immediate response in Puerto Rico,” the island’s Center for Investigative Journalism reported. Armed guards from unidentified private security companies have also been spotted around San Juan, some with long guns that may be illegal because they require special licenses given out by the government, experts told the CIJ. “It is very restricted,” said Rosa Emilia Rodríguez, the chief federal prosecutor in Puerto Rico. “I’m surprised that this is happening. I don’t know if they are off-duty police officers. I don’t know, I would have to see the circumstances. A police officer can work in a private security company in their spare time.” Héctor Pesquera, secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, is crafting an executive order with rules that private guards must abide by. Rodriguez said security contractors shouldn’t be able to carry long guns. “They would be going very far,” she told CIJ. A law enforcement source said sending private security guards over to Puerto Rico to help with relief efforts “sounds unusual since Puerto Rico is a US territory.” “Private contractors are usually hired for hot zones like the Middle East where there are concerns about terrorist attacks,” the source said. But Donahue, the CEO of Constellis, said private security details were also deployed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. “In Katrina, we protected schools, churches, hospitals, food suppliers, water, power, tent cities…everything,” he said. “The police, military and guard were doing the heavy lifting and we were in critical support roles.” In 2014, four former Blackwater security guards were found guilty in the 2007 shootings of more than 30 Iraqis in Baghdad, which raised questions about the US use of private security contractors during the Iraq War. One of the convictions has since been overturned. ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/16/private-security-mercenaries-are-now-moving-into-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
149,Trump tries to reassure Puerto Rico after threatening to cut disaster relief,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-10-13,"A day after warning Puerto Rico that the federal response on the hurricane-ravaged island won’t last “forever,” President Trump on Friday tweeted a message of reassurance to its residents. “The wonderful people of Puerto Rico, with their unmatched spirit, know how bad things were before the H’s. I will always be with them!” Trump tweeted, referring to hurricanes and the antiquated infrastructure that existed before Hurricane Irma struck Sept. 20. On Thursday, the president sent a series of tweets about his administration’s efforts on the island of 3.4 million that drew condemnation. “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” he said. “Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes,” he said, adding that Congress will have to decide how much federal funds to appropriate to the beleaguered island. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has been sharply critical of Trump, lashed out at him Thursday. “@POTUS It is not that you do not get it; you are incapable of fulfilling the moral imperative to help the people of PR. Shame on you.!” She tweeted, calling him a “Hater in Chief.” She also released a scathing statement in which she said her constituents have been frustrated by the “devastating actions, time after time, by a President whose tweets, comments and actions seem to be taken out of a book on how to add insult to injury rather than a book on how to help during a humanitarian crisis.” “He is simply incapable of understanding the contributions, the sacrifices and the commitment to democratic values that Puerto Ricans have shown over decades,” she wrote. “His actions are unbecoming of a leader of the free world,” she continued. “It is not that you do not get it, it is that you are incapable of empathy and frankly cannot get the job done.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/13/trump-tries-to-reassure-puerto-rico-after-threatening-to-cut-disaster-relief/,New York Post,Conservative
148,"Carlos Beltran: If Puerto Rico doesn’t get help, ‘people are gonna die’",Dan Martin,2017-10-13,"HOUSTON — While Carlos Beltran gets ready to play in the ALCS again, the Astros designated hitter is somewhat preoccupied by the destruction left by Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico and how dire the situation remains. “I have friends and family over there and things are not getting better,” Beltran said Thursday after the Astros worked out at Minute Maid Park in preparation for Game 1 of the ALCS. “For the first week and a half [after the storm], I couldn’t sleep. I was going crazy. I didn’t hear from my family for a week. Everyone is in the same boat, all different classes. You can have money, but if you don’t have food to buy, then you don’t have anything. The situation is critical.” And it could get worse, since President Trump has threatened to pull federal aid from the island. “If they want it to disappear, then Puerto Rico is gonna disappear,” Beltran said. “People are gonna die. I don’t think that’s gonna happen. There’s no power, no water. If we don’t get help from the United States, I don’t know what to tell you what’s gonna happen.” Beltran said he has donated $1 million in aid and also raised funds to send planes of food and water. “It benefits some people, but it’s not enough,” Beltran said. “I’m doing the best I can.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/13/carlos-beltran-if-puerto-rico-doesnt-get-help-people-are-gonna-die/,New York Post,Conservative
150,Trump suggests pulling relief workers from Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-10-12,"President Trump on Thursday suggested he may pull federal relief workers from hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico and let it fend for itself – saying emergency responders can’t stay there “forever.” In a series of tweets, the president again sought to partly blame the US territory for its own plight, saying its “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.” Trump wrote that Congress will have to decide how much federal funds to appropriate to the beleaguered island for its recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria. “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” he tweeted. He unleashed his tweetstorm while only about 10 percent of the island’s 3.4 million residents have electricity, Puerto Rico’s government said Tuesday. Trump — who has been roundly criticized for his administration’s response in Puerto Rico – also quoted TV journalist Sharyl Attkisson as saying: “Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.” “A total lack of accountability say the Governor,” he wrote. Trump has been on the defensive after his visit to the island, where he was mocked for tossing rolls of paper towels at local residents as if he was shooting jumpshots. He also was assailed for saying that the death toll was lower than the “real catastrophe” of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. His latest Twitter rant runs counter to what he said in a Sept. 29 speech. “We will not rest, however, until the people of Puerto Rico are safe,” he said, the Washington Post reported. “These are great people. We want them to be safe and sound and secure. And we will be there every day until that happens,” he added. And in a visit to the island last week, Vice President Mike Pence also vowed that Team Trump would be with Puerto Rico “every step of the way.” “We are with you, we stand with you, and we will be with you every single day until Puerto Rico is restored bigger and better than ever before,” he said. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico is still reeling from a lack of power, public health access and a rising death toll after the hurricane struck Sept. 20. At least 113 people remain unaccounted for, said Karixia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico’s Department of Public Safety, CNN reported. Acting Department of Homeland Security Elaine Duke planned to make her second trip to the island on Thursday, according to DHS spokesman David Lapan. House Speaker Paul Ryan will lead a bipartisan delegation to visit the island on Friday, according to the speaker’s office. He will be joined by House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, and Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the panel. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, Puerto Rico’s sole representative in Congress, and House GOP Conference Chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers also will be in the contingent. Last week, the Trump administration asked for $29 billion in supplemental spending. It asked for additional resources Tuesday, including $4.9 billion to fund a loan program for basic functions like infrastructure needs.

151,Zuckerberg sorry for tone-deaf Puerto Rico VR presentation,Nicolas Vega,2017-10-11,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologized after inserting a smiling cartoon likeness of himself into images of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico to show off a new virtual-reality platform. In a bizarre Facebook Live video on the social network’s VR app Spaces, Zuckerberg and Facebook social VR chief Rachel Franklin gave a virtual tour of the devastated island, with their cartoon avatars awkwardly pointing out the damage that Hurricane Maria wrought when it made landfall over two weeks ago. The pair appeared in front of flooded homes and badly-damaged landscapes, and Zuckerberg’s avatar grinned as he called virtual reality “magical” while standing in front of a group of men observing the wreckage on their island. At one point, the tone-deaf Zuckerberg and Franklin made their avatars high-five to demonstrate their new tech while standing in the middle of a completely flooded neighborhood. When the pair were done with their tour, Zuckerberg casually asked if Franklin wanted to “teleport somewhere else,” to which she suggested “maybe California?” The 33-year-old tech tycoon went on to explain the ways Facebook is contributing to the recovery effort, including donating over $1.5 million to hurricane relief organizations. But the damage was already done, and Zuckerberg got blasted for his tasteless stunt on his social media page and beyond. “Is this a joke? The Puerto Ricans are suffering and you are using our tragedy for this??” one Facebook user commented. “Heartless billionaire.” “Zuckerberg’s VR tour of Puerto Rico is everything bad about Silicon Valley. People live in a bubble there, and need to visit the real world,” one Twitter user wrote. “For what it’s worth ‘A cartoon Mark Zuckerberg toured hurricane-struck Puerto Rico in virtual reality’ is a headline worthy of The Onion,” wrote another. Zuckerberg tried to do damage control by explaining that, with an Oculus headset on his face, it really did feel like he was in Puerto Rico, and he had not anticipated how poorly the optics would translate to a third party viewing it. “I realize this wasn’t clear, and I’m sorry to anyone this offended,” he said. Over the last several weeks, Zuckerberg has been forced to apologize for several missteps. In late September, he announced that his company would be sharing 3,000 Russian-affiliated ads with government investigators and would be taking steps to protect election integrity. He also made an apology on the final day of Yom Kippur, asking Facebook users for forgiveness about the way his platform has been used in recent months. Zuckerberg has tried to quickly turn the page on this VR disaster, and Wednesday announced the early 2018 debut of the “Oculus Go,” a $199 VR headset that works without being hooked up to a phone or computer.

108,Google balloons set to bring internet to Puerto Rico,Chris Mills   ,2017-10-10,"Despite the best efforts of cell companies, the vast majority of Puerto Rico is offline. Internet coverage might seem like a luxury when people are struggling for clean water and power, but communications make moving essential supplies much easier, and enables lost families and friends to find each other.That's why the FCC has granted an emergency license to Google parent company Alphabet to deploy 30 balloons over the island, with the intention of providing basic internet service while the conventional cell network is brought back online.Project Loon is an Alphabet ""moonshot"" concept that's been running since 2013. It's meant to bring internet to remote areas using balloons. Testing is going slowly, but Loon has proven particularly good at restoring communications after a natural disaster. Earlier this year, Loon provided coverage to tens of thousands of people in Peru following major flooding.The situation in Puerto Rico appears more difficult for Google. For the balloons to work, they need a wireless backhaul, which is provided through a partnership with local cell companies. The 83% of cell towers are still down in Puerto Rico, and the groundwork hasn't been put in place. By contrast, Google had already been testing in Peru when floods hit, so it was able to partner with Telefonica to get its system up and running in weeks.Google didn't provide a timeframe for when the balloons would be up and running, but the FCC license expires in April 2018, so it's going to have to be a while before then:",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/google-balloons-set-to-bring-internet-to-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative

Zuckerberg then went on to promote Facebook’s relief efforts in Puerto Rico, including a $1.5 million donation and building “population maps” to help the Red Cross pinpoint where help is needed most.

154,Trump defends his hurricane response in Puerto Rico,Chris Perez,2017-10-08,"President Trump patted himself on the back Sunday for his response to Hurricane Maria and the devastation in Puerto Rico. “Nobody could have done what I’ve done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation,” Trump tweeted. “So much work!” The comments came just hours after the president blasted the “fake” news media for criticizing his administration’s relief efforts in the US territory, which was ravaged by Maria last month. Trump also defended his controversial paper towel throwing, insisting that he’s done a “great job” helping Puerto Rico and was just having fun. “Look, the media is fake. Meantime I’m here, it’s sort of amazing. I’m here and I sort of ask myself: ‘How did I ever get here with the horrible, unfair publicity,’” Trump told Mike Huckabee in an interview Sunday. The tweet the president sent out later in the evening, praising his response, was accompanied by a nearly nine-minute video — showing ongoing relief efforts in various parts of Puerto Rico. “What the fake news media will not show you,” a graphic says at the start of the clip. The footage goes on to describe how “more than 11,0000 DoD personnel are now in Puerto Rico providing aid” — while cutting in shots of local residents thanking FEMA and the Red Cross for the response. It concludes with a slow-motion montage, showing Trump on the island helping out. He can be seen shaking hands, smiling for photos and conducting interviews before eventually sitting down with Puerto Rican and US officials. Both the tweet and the video were met with outrage Sunday night. “People are dying. It’s not about you. Jesus Christ,” wrote one Twitter user. “What did you actually do?” another asked. Writer Ed Krassenstein added, “It was FEMA who did everything and you want to cut FEMA.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/08/trump-defends-his-hurricane-response-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
155,Puerto Rico’s governor asks Elon Musk for help with power grid,Bob Fredericks,2017-10-06,"The governor of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico — where more than 90 percent of the homes and businesses remain without power — wants Tesla chief and renewable energy guru Elon Musk to get the juice back on. “Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies?” Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted Thursday at Musk. “PR could be that flagship project.” Musk replied on Friday that he “would be happy to talk.” Rossello told reporters he expects to have a conversation with the Tesla chief executive officer, and said Puerto Rico needs to consider meeting its
energy needs with more environmentally friendly technology. Musk himself prompted the conversation with a tweet earlier Thursday. “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt. … and, most importantly, the people of PR,” Musk tweeted. “I fully support this!” Glorimar Ripoll, Puerto Rico’s chief innovation officer, chimed in a tweet replying to the governor’s post. “Let’s build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation #letstalk.” Tesla is already among a number of US companies sending rooftop panels and batteries to Puerto Rico, where more than 90 percent of homes and businesses remain without electricity more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria destroyed the grid, Bloomberg reported. The storms knocked out power to millions of utility customers who depend largely on fossil-fuel plants and long-distance transmission lines for service. Some in Puerto Rico may be in the dark for months as the grid is repaired. This isn’t the first time Musk has been approached via social media to demonstrate Tesla’s power-storage technology. Earlier this year, Musk wagered via Twitter that Tesla could install the world’s biggest battery project in Australia within 100 days, or else it would be free. He told reporters last week that the project was on track to meet the deadline. Tesla also completed a solar energy project on the island of Ta’u in American Samoa. Meanwhile, President Trump — who has commented several times on how much it will cost to rebuild the US territory — continued praising his administration’s relief efforts. “We love Puerto Rico. We’re doing great stuff there. We’re marshaling every federal resource at our disposal. We will not rest until that job is done,” he said at the White House during a celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.

156,Puerto Rico confronts mental health crisis in hurricane’s aftermath,Associated Press,2017-10-05,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Locked out of his home and with nowhere else to go, Wilfredo Ortiz Marrero rode out Hurricane Maria inside a Jeep, which was lifted off its wheels by floodwaters in the parking lot. He then endured days without enough food or running water. The lights are back on at his residence for low-income elderly people in the San Juan suburb of Trujillo Alto and food has started arriving, but he still waits as long as he can each night to leave the company of others in the lobby. Alone in his room, he sometimes starts to shake. “You get really depressed,” he said Wednesday. The hurricane that pummeled Puerto Rico two weeks ago and the scarcity-marked aftermath are taking a toll on islanders’ equilibrium. The US territory’s government counted two suicides among the death toll, which now stands at 34 and with many communities still waiting for power and clean water, there is concern about others reaching a breaking point. Students and staff at Ponce Health Sciences University are visiting shelters and people in the hardest-hit communities to provide psychological help, among other services, said Alex Ruiz, special assistant to the university’s president. “People’s whole worlds were taken from them,” he said. “People will need the proper psychological help to get through this.” At a news conference on Wednesday, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said the death toll jumped to 34 from 16 on the basis of a report that he commissioned to consult with hospitals and gain a more complete picture of the number of victims. He said 20 deaths resulted directly from the storm, including drownings and those killed in mudslides. The count also includes sick and elderly who died in the aftermath of the hurricane, including some who died because oxygen could not be delivered amid power outages. There were also two suicides, but Rossello did not provide details of those. One elderly woman took her own life Sunday inside a nursing home in Rio Piedras, another San Juan suburb. While the facility’s director, Maria Betancourt, said she didn’t believe the woman was distressed about the storm, the home was stifling hot on Wednesday after power was wiped out nearly a month ago when Hurricane Irma sideswiped the island on September 7, though a generator has kept the lights on. Outside the home, there were piles of garbage and fallen tree limbs piled on the side of the road. Ortiz and other residents of the low-income housing residence in Trujillo Alto said the building administration ordered them to leave ahead of Hurricane Maria, saying the building wasn’t equipped to weather the storm. Some were picked up by family, but Ortiz had no relatives to come get him and had no choice but to stay in his Jeep until the storm subsided and a chain on the building’s door was removed. Another resident, Felix Manuel Lopez, a 73-year-old US Army veteran, said he has seen a Veterans Affairs counselor to help with anxiety that came back after he returned from a shelter to his darkened apartment. “Everybody’s drained,” said Ruiz, the Ponce university official, who recently toured the city on the island’s southern coast to assess people’s needs. “Spirits have been broken.” On Wednesday, the governor said power has been restored to 8.6 percent of Puerto Rico’s customers and the government is hoping to have power back on for 25 percent within a month. Power is being restored at hospitals and he said the government is looking into which schools can reopen. “While we are still in an emergency we are transitioning to establishing some components of normalcy,” Rossello said. Dr. Olga Rodriguez, the dean of the Ponce Health Science University’s school of medicine, said mental health problems have increased after the hurricane and need to be dealt with swiftly. “This is very important so as to minimize the impact and emotional effects,” she said. “It’s not easy. We’re reaching some people, but the island needs more mental health professionals. If we don’t act, the situation can become problematic.” “People are unable to go to work, they cannot produce, they do not know when they can return to work,” she said. “There’s widespread despair.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/05/puerto-rico-confronts-mental-health-crisis-in-hurricanes-aftermath/,New York Post,Conservative

157,Mulvaney contradicts Trump on debt bailout for Puerto Rico,"Mark Moore, Carleton English",2017-10-04,"White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Wednesday walked back President Trump’s comment to “wipe out” Puerto Rico’s billions of dollars in debt in the aftermath of the hurricane that has devastated the US territory. “I would not take it word for word,” Mulvaney told CNN. “We are not going to deal with the fundamental difficulties Puerto Rico had before the storm.” In an interview with Bloomberg News, Mulvaney said it’s up to Puerto Rico to pay off its debt. “I think what you heard the president say is that Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out a way to solve its debt problem,”​ he said. ​“We are not going to bail them out. We are not going to pay off those debts. We are not going to bail out those bond holders.” After surveying damage in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday, Trump said in an interview on Fox News’ “Hannity” that the island owes money to “Wall Street” and “we’re going to have to wipe that out.” “They had $72 billion in debt before the hurricanes hit and they had a power plant that didn’t work before the hurricane so we’re going to help them, we’re going do something and we’re going to get it back on its feet,” the president ​said. “You can say goodbye to that.”​ After Trump’s comments, Puerto Rico’s general obligation bonds due in 2035, which have been falling since Hurricane Maria made landfall two weeks ago, fell to 32 cents on the dollar. Puerto Rico is already restructuring its debt through a bill Congress passed last summer known as PROMESA — promise in Spanish. Mulvaney referenced PROMESA — the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act — during the CNN interview and said that process would continue. “So those bonds are being dealt with, were being dealt with before the storm, will be dealt with after the storm through the PROMESA process,” he told CNN. Earlier Wednesday, Trump lashed out on Twitter over the “Fake” news coverage of his trip. “Wow, so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!” he wrote. Trump was criticized when he told Puerto Rican officials they were lucky the island wasn’t hit with a Katrina-like catastrophe because it would have caused even more death and destruction and joked how expensive relief efforts were becoming, saying “you are throwing our budget out of whack.” With Wire Services ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/04/mulvaney-contradicts-trump-on-debt-bailout-for-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative

Gov. Ricardo Rossello also says he believes the hurricane caused $90 billion in damage across the island. The governor made the announcement at a news conference following U.S. President Donald Trump’s short visit to the U.S. territory to assess the storm’s impact. During his stop, Trump congratulated Puerto Ricans for avoiding a high death toll of “a real catastrophe like Katrina.” As many as 1,800 people died in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached levees protecting New Orleans.

The state and UPS are delivering 60,000 UNICEF emergency supply kits and the state is preparing to send more than 100 medical professionals to the island. The kits will contain water purification tablets, water buckets, soap, toothpaste, detergent and sanitary pads, among other items. Medical supplies, including tetanus vaccines, antibiotics, first aid products and surgical gear, are on the way to hospitals and community health organizations. The donations of goods and labor are coming from the UJA Federation of New York, a medical supply charity called Afya Foundation, the Greater New York Hospital Association, unions and others. Cuomo estimates that the state is coordinating the delivery of roughly $500,000 worth of medical supplies.

112,President Trump isn't responsible for Puerto Rico’s decades of corruption and collapse,Liz Peek,2017-10-03,"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are very, very concerned about the people of Puerto Rico. Both have joined the mayor of San Juan in criticizing President Trump for not doing enough for the Commonwealth in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.Seriously, where have they been?Where were they when Puerto Rico’s debts ballooned to $123 billion, thrusting the economy into an 11-year recession?Where were they when 50,000 of the island’s best and brightest hightailed to the mainland every year, looking for jobs and opportunities, as median household income sank to $18,626 as compared to $56,516 on the mainland?Where were they as the territory’s power system went bust, while its administrators came under FBI investigation for stealing from the people of Puerto Rico?They were nowhere to be seen, except of course during election season. As more Puerto Ricans left the island looking for work, they swelled the Hispanic population in Florida, a group that Hillary Clinton’s campaign determined was key to her success in the state. In Orlando alone there were 80,000 registered Puerto Ricans. Signing up new Puerto Rican voters, who as residents of the U.S. are allowed to cast a ballot, became a critical tactic in Clinton’s Florida strategy. Polling determined that 74 percent of the newcomers were likely to support Hillary, as compared to 17 percent that fell in Trump’s column.Hillary appealed to Puerto Ricans in New York, Florida and elsewhere by appearing to support their enthusiasm for statehood. She didn’t bother to campaign in the territory, even though winning Puerto Rico’s Democratic primary helped her quest for the nomination last year. She sent Bill, instead.That’s ironic because it was President Bill Clinton who signed the repeal of Section 936, the 1976 tax provision that exempted corporations operating in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico from federal taxes and caused a surge in economic activity on the island. That loophole caused numerous U.S. companies to set up shop in Puerto Rico, extending an industrialization program initiated in the 1950s called Operation Bootstrap. Over the period 1950 to 1980 per capita GNP rose ten-fold while disposable income soared 1,600 per cent. In the twenty years following the repeal of the tax advantage, manufacturing jobs were cut in half. Ten years after Clinton signed the phase-out into law, employment peaked in Puerto Rico, and the government started borrowing to make ends meet.Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, also campaigning for Puerto Rican votes, was one of the few that voted last year against the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, called Promesa, describing it as a return to “the worst form of colonialism.” The Promesa established a board, similar to those enacted to oversee the rescue of New York in the 1970s and Detroit in 2014, to resolve the island’s financial situation and to rebuild its economy. Bernie was bound to hate the measure, especially since one of its key missions was to reduce the island’s minimum wage. Given that cheap labor abounds in neighboring islands, and the Commonwealth’s persistently high unemployment, the federal minimum of $7.25 is injurious. Soon after losing the Puerto Rico primary, Sanders dropped the issue.To be fair, Clinton and Sanders are not alone in having ignored Puerto Rico’s problems. Legislators on both sides of the aisle have stood idly by, hoping the territory’s unpayable debts would miraculously disappear. Now that the island’s dysfunction has morphed from dangerous to fatal, and Puerto Rico is blaming Hurricane Maria and Donald Trump for its misfortunes, Americans are taking a hard look at just how badly the Commonwealth has been mismanaged. They’re discovering that the damage wrought by recent storms, and the inadequate emergency response, was inevitable.The federal oversight board claimed in its filings that the local government is “unable to provide its citizens effective services.”   A year ago, the New York Times wrote that the territory’s towering debt burden had “crowded out other governmental spending in Puerto Rico, leaving a wake of devastation: closed schools, fewer hospital beds, homeless people squatting in abandoned houses.”  These conditions were devastating; Hurricane Maria made them life-threatening.As disastrous as Puerto Rico’s overall finances have become, the management of the territory’s now-bankrupt power system  the source of much of today’s distress  has been even worse.  The utility, called Prepa, has for decades sent free power to “78 municipalities, many government endeavors, and even to for-profit businesses,” as the Times reports, leading to high bills for private citizens and declining service.   The system long relied on imported oil; the management has been accused of improper use of substandard fuel and of profiteering. Weeks ago, before any major storms had hit the island, Prepa’s management warned that outages might last up to six months, given the antiquated state of its infrastructure. In September the Times quoted a 2016 report saying that Prepa “appears to be running on fumes, and…desperately requires an infusion of capital—monetary, human, and intellectual—to restore a functional utility.” No wonder most of the island is still without power. If any good is to come out of the devastation of Hurricane Maria, perhaps it will be that Americans learn that political corruption fed by high taxes and a bloated bureaucracy is a toxic combination. This is not Venezuela. This is a U.S. territory, and a struggling neighbor, which needs our help and a serious economic reboot.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/president-trump-isnt-responsible-for-puerto-ricos-decades-of-corruption-and-collapse,Fox,Conservative
113,Newt Gingrich: Puerto Rico -- A 21st century plan for prosperity,Newt Gingrich,2017-10-03,"To help the people of Puerto Rico, the United States should think of its job in two phases.Phase one is to solve the immediate crisis.Currently, the island is crippled. Days before Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma had already knocked out electricity for 1 million Puerto Ricans. Then, Maria's 165 mile-per-hour winds, combined with one day of rain so heavy it equaled three days’ worth of rainfall in Houston's extraordinary storm experience from Hurricane Harvey, simply devastated the island.The collapse of services in Puerto Rico also creates a potential migration crisis that could rob the island of a generation of talent. The combined impact of these two hurricanes has caused some of the most thorough destruction any American community has ever experienced.Eighty percent of the island’s electrical transmissions system has been destroyed. The collapse of the electrical grid has compounded every human need. There is a real danger that the loss of refrigeration and clean water will lead to a dramatic spread of disease across the island.Puerto Rico is experiencing the kind of collapse Bill Forstchen wrote about in his book One Second After. The novel describes the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse attack, which destroys the U.S. electrical grid.One good thing that could come from Puerto Rico’s experience may be a much greater investment in hardening the island’s power infrastructure against an EMP, caused by either a foreign attack or a natural solar event. Another good result could be a realization of how vulnerable the entire United States electricity grid is to an electromagnetic event.The magnitude of eroded highways, collapsed bridges, weakened dams, and other infrastructure damage is historic and will take an enormous effort to overcome. For example, more than 90 percent of the telephone cell towers were knocked out by the storm.Washington is only now beginning to realize how much bigger and more aggressive the first phase of recovery and response must be. More military assets must be deployed and more emergency engineering will have to be implemented to avoid further problems in the next 30 to 60 days.The collapse of services in Puerto Rico also creates a potential migration crisis that could rob the island of a generation of talent. Faced with such destruction, many Puerto Ricans will exercise their rights as American citizens to move to the mainland. This would accelerate an already growing trend. From 2005 to 2015, about 446,000 Puerto Ricans moved to the mainland  about 13 percent of the island’s population.The longer the crisis goes on, the greater the loss of talent will be.Even if we can quickly solve the immediate problems, the average Puerto Rican may still conclude that life on the post-hurricane island will be inadequate. This would further devastate the island and its future. We must convince the most energetic, ambitious, and competent younger Puerto Ricans to stay and invest their lives in their home island by ensuring a dramatically better future.That is why the recovery and survival effort must be immediately followed by phase two: ""Creating a 21st Century Puerto Rico.""Creating a 21st century Puerto Rico may seem a little premature when most Puerto Ricans are currently without electricity, drinkable water, or permanent shelter. However, creating a 21st century Puerto Rico must be advocated and described as early as possible. Puerto Ricans must know their island will have a future worth investing their lives in.The federal government is going to have to invest a lot in Puerto Rico's recovery. The scale of devastation requires a massive rebuilding program.The key to Puerto Rico's future is to avoid rebuilding obsolete, old infrastructure and instead investing money in a new, modern, 21st century Puerto Rico. This will increase economic growth and improve quality of life on the island.The Trump administration is in a perfect position to develop and implement a 21st century infrastructure program for Puerto Rico.All the work the administration has done in thinking through its infrastructure plan, its economic growth agenda, and its vocational education and training plans for the mainland can be brought to bear to develop a plan for 21st century Puerto Rican prosperity.A 21st century investment plan should:1. Implement deregulatory reforms which will enable government and private contractors to cut through red tape and save time and money, while securing Puerto Rico's future prosperity;2. Design and develop new, modern, island-wide infrastructure systems. Replacing rather than repairing old highway, electrical, and water systems will maximize economic growth, tourism, and convenience for residents. The administration should integrate private sector and private capital to leverage funds;3. Rebuild the electric grid with resilience, so it can survive both future natural disasters and potential EMP events. Once the system is completed, the administration should grant long-term concessions to the private sector under a payment mechanism to reimburse the federal taxpayers and ensure long-term modernization and performance;4. Create a broadband network for the entire island, so every Puerto Rican can have access to high-speed internet for education, shopping, and work. The administration should examine space-based and other broadband systems being developed for large, rural areas;5. Develop an island-wide health system. The administration should seek help from the best large mainland health systems (including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) to help develop a system to modernize the hospitals, integrate community health systems, and use telemedicine and other modern delivery systems so even the most remote communities are served;6. Use cutting edge technologies to create smart city solutions to improve connectivity and modernize the island’s cities and towns;7. Create an island-wide enterprise zone with tax advantages for investing and operating in Puerto Rico. The need for economic growth is going to be so great, and the disadvantages of an island territory competing with the mainland are such that companies must be given incentives for investing in and operating in Puerto Rico. More targeted tax advantages have clearly worked to create jobs in Puerto Rico in the past, but the scale of devastation is so great the entire island should be given enterprise zone status for at least the next 20 years.  It is vital to make doing business in Puerto Rico more attractive than in nearby foreign countries. This creates American jobs for American citizens living in Puerto Rico;8. Make the Jones Act shipping exemption for Puerto Rico permanent. As a Caribbean island, Puerto Rico is at a huge disadvantage by being forced to pay American domestic shipping prices while all its competitors have dramatically lower world market shipping rates. The Jones Act makes shipping to Puerto Rico dramatically more expensive than it is for other islands. This both raises the cost of living and weakens Puerto Rican companies trying to compete. Repealing the Jones Act for Puerto Rico would be like a giant tax cut that would provide an economic stimulus for the island;9. Apply the Trump administration apprenticeship, vocational education, and online learning initiatives to help the Puerto Rican work force acquire the knowledge and skills needed to do the jobs the enterprise zone status will bring to the island.These are examples of the kind of forward-looking initiatives that would give Puerto Ricans hope that their island will bounce back as an exciting desirable place to work and live.Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich is the host of the ""Newt’s World"" podcast and author of the New York Times bestseller ""Trump and the American Future."" His latest book is ""Big Government Socialism.""

117,"In hard-hit Puerto Rico neighborhood, no sign of federal aid",,2017-10-03," A few miles from the air base where President Donald Trump was touting his administration's response to Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans were stacking fallen tree branches, pieces of zinc roofing and sewage-soaked clothes in shopping carts and piling them on street corners alongside piles of wet mattresses.There is still no power in the neighborhood known as Playita, and water only came back Sunday. No trucks have come to clear debris in the heart of the capital of Puerto Rico and the few hundred residents of this neighborhood of wood and cinderblock houses are still cleaning sewer water from their homes and business. They say they have not seen federal officials since Maria struck the island on Sept. 20.""The need is everywhere,"" Jacke Cordero, 51 said as he used a pressure-washer to spray reeking floodwater out of his small cafe, the Corner of Faith. ""Water, food, the supermarkets are closed.""Ray Negron rested nearby in the shade of a church after a morning spent collecting debris.""What more do they want us to do?"" said Negron, who is 38 and unemployed. ""We've already cleaned everything up.""He said the residents of Playita were waiting for officials to take away the massive piles of trash that residents had collected.""Nobody's come,"" Negron said. Addressing a distant Trump, he said: ""Please, stop marginalizing us.""Playita has long been one of San Juan's least-favored neighborhoods, cut off by a highway but close to a housing project that has been receiving a relatively high degree of attention in the recovery effort.Soon after the storm, residents went to a highway overpass to hang sheets emblazoned with messages pleading for help from the local and federal governments: ""Playita needs food and water. SOS.""Janelys Melendez, a 39-year-old evangelical minister, said no one should mistake Playita's pleas for help with an unwillingness to do things for themselves.""You can see Puerto Rico lifting itself up here. No one's lying back,"" she said. ""They're doing what they can. It's everyone's responsibility, not just the government's.""As she spoke, convenience store-owner Raymond Ortiz walked through Playita handing out Styrofoam containers of rice and beans he and his wife had cooked for people who didn't have enough to eat.He said the Salvation Army had distributed aid in Playita in recent days, but he had seen no federal effort.""We're doing what we can,"" he said. ""We really need help. Trump should come help us.""As he spoke, Trump was visiting Guaynabo, one of San Juan's wealthiest neighborhoods and one that has recovered fastest from the storm.Trump highlighted Puerto Rico's relatively low death toll compared with ""a real catastrophe like Katrina"" as he opened a tour of the island's devastation Tuesday, focusing on the best of the reviews he and his administration are getting rather than criticism of the federal response to Hurricane Maria.Trump pledged an all-out effort to help the island but added: ""Now I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that's fine. We've saved a lot of lives.""The burdens of recovering from the storm in a city where people are saving their gas and traffic rush-hour heavy throughout the day helped keep a couple of small protests against Trump's visit down to a handful of people who gathered outside the city's convention center and near the air base where the president spoke.Other Puerto Ricans said they appreciated the president's visit, and there was praise for Trump even in Playita, where retired government human resources manager Lucy Falero, 70, said, ""We have to appreciate this trip.""""We've never had a president who's visited after a disaster like this,"" she said.

It's been wiped out,"" Trump said last week about Puerto Rico following the hurricane that left most people without power and fresh drinking water. ""Nobody has ever seen anything like it.""The president is expected to spend at least five hours in Puerto Rico during which he will meet first responders, local politicians and some residents. He is expected to meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossell, visit a local church, and attend briefings. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, they also will meet Marine Corps and Navy personnel.It will be Trump’s fourth trip to a region devastated by natural disasters, including Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Most Puerto Rican politicians have worked closely with the Trump administration in coordinating the recovery efforts, but some local politicians have attacked Trump for, in their view, lousy response to the disaster.""We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency,"" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz slammed the Trump administration during a press conference last Friday, adding that a “genocide” is looming if the crisis is not handled.Trump has fired back at criticism, tweeting: “Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.”FEMA reportedly said there are more than 10,000 federal personnel on the island providing vital recovery support. Nearly 50 percent of people now have access to drinking water, the agency added.Hurricane Maria has exacerbated the dire situation in Puerto Rico, a territory that has been in economic recession for about a decade and undergoing a debt crisis. The economic woes left the country’s infrastructure in a sorry state, making the recovery harder.Almost two weeks after the hurricane slammed the territory, more than 90 percent of residents are still left without power. Some hospitals reportedly have no power as well. Rural areas still struggle to access essential needs such as food, fresh water or medicine.Trump’s visit is thought to be about fixing the perception among some that the administration has neglected the response to the crisis. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday the trip will be about the recovery to which the administration is “fully committed to.”""The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,"" she said..",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-visit-puerto-rico-amid-accusations-of-mishandling-hurricane-maria-aftermath,Fox,Conservative
115,"Trump surveys hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, meets San Juan mayor after feud",Alex Pappas,2017-10-03,"President Trump visited storm-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday to survey damage and talk to residents, while also meeting and briefly praising the San Juan mayor following their feud over the administration's response to Hurricane Maria.The president, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, participated in a packed briefing on storm recovery shortly after landing at Luis Muñiz Air National Guard Base in San Juan.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has repeatedly criticized the president’s actions since the storm wreaked havoc on the U.S. territory last month, was seen shaking Trump's hand and joining him for the briefing in a hangar.Trump didn’t mention Cruz in his remarks to the media. But  in comments that seemed meant to draw a contrast  the president singled out Ricardo Rosselló, the governor of Puerto Rico, for praise.“This governor did not play politics,” Trump said. “He didn’t play it all. He was saying it like it was. And he was giving us the highest grades.”While in Puerto Rico, Trump viewed the damage from a helicopter, participated in several briefings with officials, met storm victims and toured the USS Kearsarge. He also met with senior military personnel and government officials, including Rosselló and Kenneth Mapp, the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was also severely damaged by the storm.“Now, I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little bit out of whack,” the president said at the hangar briefing. “Because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that’s fine, we’ve saved a lot of lives.”The president pointed out that 16 people died in Puerto Rico because of Maria -- a death count far lower than that of “a real catastrophe like Katrina” in 2005.“Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said. “You can be very proud of all your people.”Trump's visit comes just days after getting into a high-profile spat with the San Juan mayor.Cruz had begged the administration to ""make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives.""Trump responded angrily on Twitter, deriding the ""poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.""Trump downplayed the spat with the mayor when asked about it by reporters as he departed the White House on Tuesday.“Well, I think she’s come back a long way,” Trump said. “I think it’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done, and people are looking at that. And in Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. And I’ll tell you what, I think we’ve done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it’s actually a much tougher situation.”But Trump added: “On a local level, they have to give us more help.”After his hangar briefing, Trump walked from home to home through a neighborhood in Guaynabo, where piles of debris and downed trees were visible. Accompanied by Puerto Rico’s governor, Trump greeted residents and took photos with them outside their homes.Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island's entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads.Nearly two weeks after the Puerto Rico storm, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access such basic necessities as food, fresh water and cash.Trump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat a perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm's destruction in its immediate aftermath.While early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved.According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and 45 percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running.Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing on Tuesday that the United States military has 10,000 troops on the ground in Puerto Rico.A number of top officials joined the president for Tuesday's trip, including Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, Small Business administrator Linda McMahon and Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert.FEMA administrator Brock Long is also in Puerto Rico.Fox News'  Lucas Tomlinson and .",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-surveys-hurricane-ravaged-puerto-rico-meets-san-juan-mayor-after-feud,Fox,Conservative
114,"Rachel Campos-Duffy, Rep. Sean Duffy: Making Puerto Rico great again",Rachel Campos-Duffy,2017-10-03,"Editor's note: This article was originally published on September 27, 2017.President Trump will go to Puerto Rico next week to oversee ongoing rescue and relief efforts on the island which was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. With this visit comes the opportunity to help make Puerto Rico great again.When candidate Donald Trump ran for the highest office in the land, he promised to fight for forgotten Americans. In the presidential election of 2016, the forgotten Americans of the Upper Midwest and the coal country of Kentucky and West Virginia, many of them life-long Democrats, delivered a decisive win for this first-time Republican candidate. The tropical island of Puerto Rico couldn’t be more different than America’s rust belt or the mountains of Appalachia, but here too live Americans who feel forgotten by our leaders and left behind by our economy.Prior to President Obama, no sitting U.S. president had visited Puerto Rico since Gerald Ford. Still, President Obama’s 2012 visit was just a campaign pit stop, and it was for about as much time as he spent at a baseball game in Cuba with dictator Raul Castro.That three-day visit to Cuba, incidentally, lavished glowing attention to the communist island and boosted Cuban tourism by 13 percent. That money and attention should have gone to helping our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico.President Trump won’t go to Puerto Rico to fundraise or campaign. He’ll go to show the people of Puerto Rico that he cares, to see the island-wide damage up close and personal, and to make sure that the federal government and mainland Americans don’t forget about our fellow citizens struggling in Puerto Rico.President Trump's business reputation as a ""doer"" who can get results is essential now more than ever, as the hurricanes have knocked out most of the island’s power and basic infrastructure.Moreover, with his extensive experience in the tourism industry, President Trump is uniquely positioned to understand and empathize with the effects of Irma and Maria on the island’s fragile economy.His business background will also help him fully appreciate the consequences of the current debt crisis plaguing the island. Looking at the images of devastation coming out of Puerto Rico, it's hard to believe that anything could inflict as much damage as the winds and rains of these Category 4 hurricanes. But long before Irma and Maria, Puerto Rico’s irresponsible government policies led to economic recession, joblessness, massive debt, and an unprecedented exodus to the U.S. mainland. Tens of thousands of Puerto Rico’s most talented and ambitious citizens have made the painful decision to leave their families and their beautiful island in search of opportunities on the mainland, and countless thousands more will be forced to do the same if there is no decisive action to rebuild the island.The Republican Congress has taken the lead in trying to help Puerto Rico restructure its debts and make the necessary reforms to get back on its economic feet through a bill introduced and passed last year called PROMESA. PROMESA, crafted to address the economic crisis, satisfy bondholders holding Puerto Rican debt, and protect U.S. taxpayers from another bailout, was a good and necessary first step. But making Puerto Rico great again will require more than Congress. It will need the attention and leadership of the president.While in Puerto Rico, President Trump will not only see the effects of Irma and Maria, but also have an opportunity to discuss the deeper and equally damaging effects of the Puerto Rican debt crisis with Governor Ricardo Rosselló and the island’s business community.Moreover, after experiencing the negative effects of big, unsustainable government, Puerto Ricans may be more receptive than ever to conservative ideas and solutions such as limited government, fiscal restraint, and serious entitlement and regulatory reform that will attract new investment to the island, and grow their economy. A strong, durable Puerto Rican economy will leave the island better prepared to handle future natural disasters.So what can the rest of us do to help our American brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico? Well, if you are planning a Caribbean vacation, you can start by booking it to this warm and friendly island paradise as soon as it is ready to receive tourists. As a U.S. territory, your trip to Puerto Rico doesn’t require a passport or currency exchange. Hotels and amenities meet U.S. standards  not so in Cuba. And unlike Cuba, where your tourist dollars go directly to the communist Cuban regime, thereby funding and enabling a brutal dictatorship, you can feel good knowing that every dollar you spend on your dream vacation to Puerto Rico is, indeed, making America great again!Rachel Campos-Duffy serves as a co-host of FOX & Friends Weekend and co-host of From the Kitchen Table podcast with her husband Sean Duffy.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rachel-campos-duffy-rep-sean-duffy-making-puerto-rico-great-again,Fox,Conservative
160,Only 5% of Puerto Rico has electricity on eve of Trump visit,Bruce Golding,2017-10-02,"Nearly all of Puerto Rico remained blacked out Monday on the eve of a visit by President Trump — and the US Energy Department offered a grim forecast for the restoration of electricity. Little more than 5 percent of electrical customers had service on the storm-ravaged island, according to officials — with the head of its power utility saying that number would rise to just 15 percent over the next two weeks. Food and drinking water also remained in short supply, and the Federal Communications Commission said more than 88 percent of cellphone towers were out of service, a number virtually unchanged since Saturday. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said the government was in danger of running out of money because the economy ground to a halt in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island Sept. 20. “There is no cash on hand,” Rosselló told the local El Nuevo Dia newspaper. “We have made a huge effort to get $2 billion in cash. But let me tell you what $2 billion means when you have zero collection: It’s basically a month government’s payroll, a little bit more.” In the brightest development, Rosselló said more than 720 of the island’s 1,100 gas stations were back in business, with the average wait time less than an hour, down from six or seven hours just a few days ago. Rosselló said “gasoline is getting here,” with around 1 million barrels of gas and 500,000 of diesel expected to arrive this week. The Trump administration is preparing to ask lawmakers for $13 billion in new funding to help Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida recover from a series of powerful storms, congressional sources told Reuters. The president said he and first lady Melania Trump will fly early Tuesday to Puerto Rico, where they’ll meet with first responders and some of the 3.4 million struggling residents. While acknowledging the ongoing electrical and communications problems, Trump said it’s “amazing what’s been done in a very short period of time.” “There’s never been a piece of land that we’ve known that was so devastated,” he said. Trump also said he planned to sit down with Gov. Kenneth Mapp of the US Virgin Islands, noting St. Croix was so badly damaged that Mapp “is probably going to meet us in Puerto Rico.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration had reached out to San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who on Saturday criticized Trump’s response to the storm. “She’s been invited to participate in the events tomorrow, as well,” Sanders said.

161,"Jorge Posada, Ricky Martin and more visit Puerto Rico for recovery efforts",Jennifer Gould,2017-10-02,"New York Yankee all-star Jorge Posada and his wife Laura landed in Puerto Rico today with singers Ricky Martin, Gloria Estefan and others to bring help and hope to the devastated island. It is the Posadas’ fourth trip since Hurricane Maria hit. They have raised almost $300,000 thanks to their youcaring.com hurricane relief campaign, and have flown supplies to Puerto Rico. The planes return to Miami filled with people who need medical treatment on the mainland. “People were dying and they couldn’t contact 911 or the police or a funeral home, so they buried their loved ones themselves in their backyards. They still can’t leave their homes. That’s the truth of the matter,” Laura Posada told The Post in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico. “We come and go, bringing planes with supplies. Today was a special day. I flew here with athletes and celebrities, like Ricky Martin on a Jet Blue plane. We came together to give the people a message of hope. We are here for them and we won’t forget about them when this isn’t news anymore,” she added. In Puerto Rico, many hospitals have shut down. They have no electricity or supplies. “The problem is that the supplies are contaminated so the hospitals are not safe and a lot of the doctors have left. The best thing we can do is get people out of hospitals that aren’t ready to take care of them,” Posada said. One tiny tot the Posadas evacuated was a 1-year-old on oxygen with a feeding tube in his stomach. “The mom and her son were supposed to fly off the island with Delta, but Delta wouldn’t let them on the plane because the mother didn’t have enough batteries for the oxygen. The batteries cost $250 each and it was impossible,” Posada said. “Her helplessness really touched me. Just to see that mom so alone and so vulnerable is one of the toughest things I’ve dealt with.” The Posadas also run the Jorge Posada Foundation, a non-profit that they launched after their son Jorge Jr. was diagnosed with Craniosynostosis, and underwent nine surgeries of his own to survive. The non-profit helps raise awareness and funds for research and families in need. So far the Posadas have bought tickets for about 80 passengers. About 60 of them needed medical treatment, including chemotherapy and dialysis. In a telephone interview from Puerto Rico, Posada said that while San Juan is doing better, people in the western part of the island are still without food, water and electricity. “On the Western part of the island, people are not getting supplies. They have no food or water. People are surviving on crackers and boiling whatever water they can find,” she said. The curfew has been extended from 6 am to 9 pm. “It’s really dangerous to be out after 9 pm,” Posada said. “People are desperate. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. It’s not safe for anyone.” Laura Posada was also also able to get her immediate family off the island, including her father who is diabetic and needed insulin. Other relatives wanted to stay and asked for food and water, which the Posadas brought. Jorge Posada’s parents, however, are still on the island. “They refuse to leave, so we got them a generator. Like many, they fear that if they leave, their house will be looted and that when they return they will have nothing,” Laura Posada said. For now, the Posadas are calling on the government for more help. “The government needs to send more help to Puerto Rico,” she said. “There are immediate needs for food, water and electricity but we will still need the support of the government for the long process of recovery. We don’t want them to forget about us. This shouldn’t be a story about the president and the mayor of San Juan. It’s not a good guy, bad guy story. It’s a story about the people of Puerto Rico who are American citizens. We have been there for the Virgin Islands. We are a people who are always willing to help and this time, we are the ones who need assistance. At the end of the day we all want what is best for Puerto Rico.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/02/jorge-posada-ricky-martin-and-more-visit-puerto-rico-for-recovery-effots/,New York Post,Conservative
163,9/11 fire commissioner to lead Puerto Rico recovery efforts,"Susan Edelman, Reuven Fenton",2017-10-01,"Former FDNY commissioner Thomas Von Essen, who presided over New York’s Bravest during 9/11, has been named head of the FEMA region that serves Puerto Rico — making him the new leader of the hurricane recovery efforts. “There’s a lot of work to do,” Von Essen told The Post. “I’m excited to go down there to continue the work that they’ve done, that they’ve started.” Speaking Sunday — a little over a week after Hurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean — Von Essen described how the devastation that the storm left in its wake ultimately made him take the job as the new head of FEMA Region 2, which also serves New York, New Jersey and the US Virgin Islands. “They asked me if I would take this over a month ago, actually right before the hurricanes,” Von Essen explained. “At first I said no. They asked me a couple more times, I said yes. When I’d heard about the hurricanes, it made me more interested — the idea of really getting involved at places I knew were really going to need a lot of help over a long period of time.” Von Essen, a 31-year veteran of the FDNY, will be spending the next week in Washington DC getting briefed before he makes his way down to Puerto Rico. “It’s an honor to be asked to come back and work again to help people that really need it, and I’m looking forward to it,” he said. “I’ve seen what FEMA can do. I know how they can help people that really need it. My life was the the FDNY, surrounded by people like that who are able to make a different and help strangers and I’m looking forward to making a difference as soon as I can.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/10/01/911-fire-commissioner-to-lead-puerto-rico-recovery-efforts/,New York Post,Conservative
164,This family in Puerto Rico lost everything to Hurricane Maria,Associated Press,2017-10-01,"SAN LAZARO, Puerto Rico — Several generations of the Sortre family rode out Hurricane Maria in a neighbor’s concrete home, listening to ferocious wind flinging wood and other debris against the roof and hoping it wasn’t pieces of their own wooden houses. Their hopes were crushed when they emerged the morning after the storm passed over the homes in this small mountain town in Puerto Rico. “When I saw the house, I felt immense sadness because I lost everything I had gained with the sacrifices made over the years,” said Yadira Sortre. She said her house, her mother’s and those of her siblings were destroyed. “The whole family lost everything,” she said. Since then, townspeople have struggled to get by. The electricity is out and they are cut off because a bridge linking them to the community of San Lazaro was washed away. Neighbors are helping each other the best they can. People are eating only once a day and drinking a lot of coffee. Some people are sleeping in cars. Julia Rivera lost part of her house and the school where she normally has a job has been damaged.

162,Trump calls his Puerto Rico critics ‘politically motivated ingrates’,Mark Moore,2017-10-01,"President Trump lashed out at “politically motivated ingrates” in a Tweet on Sunday, ramping up his feud with the mayor of San Juan and the “Fake News” media for their criticism of his response to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
​
“We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates, ” the president wrote. In earlier tweets, Trump claimed the news media was in cahoots with Democrats to ridicule his hurricane relief efforts. On Saturday, he lashed out at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and said she had been complimentary to him on his efforts until Democrats approached her and then she began making politically-motivated attacks against him. Cruz, in an interview on Friday, blasted Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke for saying the administration’s response so far has been a “good news story” for the government’s ability to reach people. “Maybe from where she’s standing it’s a good news story. When you’re drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story ,” Cruz shot back. “When you don’t have food for a baby, it’s not a good news story. ” Trump, who spent the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., said his administration is making a difference in Puerto Rico. “People are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military. All buildings now inspected for safety,” wrote Trump, who will head to Puerto Rico on Tuesday to survey hurricane damage. “Thank you to the Governor of P.R. and to all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders.

118,"FEMA's Long: No time for mayor's 'spout off,' focused on Puerto Rico",,2017-10-01,"FEMA Director Brock Long, leading the federal hurricane response in Puerto Rico, on Sunday slammed critics and the media for what he considers misinformation, saying “I don’t have time for that.”“The problem is information is being misrepresented across the board,” Long told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. “I don’t have time for that. What he have time for is being laser focused on helping the people of Puerto Rico. … You should come down here. You should see what’s up.”Long acknowledged the difficulties, saying, “Every day we have progress. Every day we have setbacks. … Do we have a long way to go? Absolutely.”However, he argued the response on the island of Puerto Rico is “the most logistically challenging event that the United States has ever seen.”He also argued the financially-strapped country’s infrastructure -- including airports, roads, ports and bridges -- was “fragile” before being hit by hurricanes Irma, then Maria.However, roughly two weeks later, 11 major highways have been reopened, 700 of roughly 1,000 gas stations now have petroleum, 300 pharmacies are now operating and 16 people so far have died, compared to about 1,800 deaths during and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans, Long said. “I think we have to filter out the noise,” he said from FEMA headquarters. “My guys here have been busting their rears for nearly 40 days to help Americans.”Long spoke after San Juan Mayor Yulin Cruz criticized acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke for saying Friday that the federal response in Puerto Rico was a “feel good story.”“This is not a good news story,” Cruz said. “This is a people dying story.”Trump on Saturday responded to Cruz’s criticism, suggesting her lack of leadership has resulted in problems with the recovery effort.“Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,” Trump responded in one of the tweets. ""They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.”Long on Sunday also pointed to a recent Washington Examiner story in which another mayor said Cruz, a Democrat, has missed several recovery-effort meetings with U.S. military and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. “If the mayors decide not to be part of that, then the response is fragmented,” he said. “We can choose to look at what (Cruz) spouts off or what others spout off or we can choose to look at what’s being done.”Long also suggested Duke’s comments had been taken out of context.And he criticized a live report earlier on “Fox News Sunday” that pointed out fewer federal recovery-effort flights are landing at the San Juan airport.“We are not using San Juan to the degree we were,” Long said, arguing other points-of-entry are now being used.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/femas-long-no-time-for-mayors-spout-off-focused-on-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative

""We are with you and Puerto Rico.""Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, a Democrat, has said the administration is being responsive to the island's needs and on Saturday appeared to try to deflect questions about Cruz's comments.He suggested the Trump-Cruz issue was to his ""side"" and said his message is that he's ""here to help"" and collaborate with the federal government on resources.On Friday, Rossello said Trump has responded to his requests after the island was clipped by Hurricane Irma, then struck by Maria. He also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency and its director, Brock Long, have essentially been in contact with him ""all of the time.Trump's acting homeland security secretary, Elaine Duke, visited the island Friday, surveying the landscape by helicopter in an hour-long tour, driving past still-flooded streets, twisted billboards and roofs with gaping holes, and offering encouragement to some of the 10,000 emergency personnel she says the U.S. government has on the ground.On Thursday, the U.S. military named Buchanan to oversee the response effort.Trump is expected to survey the damage Tuesday.Duke tried, too, to move on from the remarks she made a day earlier in which she called the federal relief effort a ""good-news story."" But on that front, she ran into winds as fierce as Maria.""We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency,"" Cruz said in a news conference. ""I am begging, begging anyone that can hear us, to save us from dying.""Thousands more Puerto Ricans got water and rationed food Friday as an aid bottleneck began to ease. By now, telecommunications are back for about 30 percent of the island, nearly half of the supermarkets have reopened at least for reduced hours and about 60 percent of the gas stations are pumping.But many remain desperate for necessities, most urgently water, long after the Sept. 20 hurricane.Trump said Puerto Rico is ""totally unable"" to handle the catastrophe on its own. ""They are working so hard, but there's nothing left,"" he said. ""It's been wiped out."" He said the government is ""fully engaged in the disaster and the response and recovery effort.""Trump said he was not aware of Duke's ""good-news"" remark.""I haven't heard what she said,"" he told reporters. ""I can tell you this: We have done an incredible job considering there's absolutely nothing to work with.""Yet even in voicing solidarity and sympathy with Puerto Rico, he drew attention again to the island's pre-hurricane debt burden and infrastructure woes, leaving doubt how far Washington will go to make the U.S. territory whole.""Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort -- it will end up being one of the biggest ever -- will be funded and organized, and what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island,"" he said.

165,Trump launches personal attack on mayor amid crisis in Puerto Rico,"Kathianne Boniello, Mary Kay Linge",2017-09-30,"Faced with mounting criticism over his administration’s response to recovery efforts on hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico — including an angry statement from the mayor of San Juan — President Trump lashed out early Saturday on Twitter. “The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” the president wrote at 4:19 am. “…Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They…….want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job,” he continued in a series of tweets. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz slammed the Trump administration Friday after Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke called the much-maligned recovery effort “a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane.” “This is a ‘people are dying’ story,” Yulin Cruz said angrily on Friday. The Puerto Rican death toll from Hurricane Maria stands at 16, but the number is expected to rise as the island of 3.5 million remains without power and supplies such as clean water. The Administration has been criticized for dragging its feet in getting help to the US Territory. Trump continued his tweetstorm by praising first responders before he hit at a favorite punching bag: the media. “The military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed,” he wrote at 4:33 am. “Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to ‘get Trump.’ Not fair to FR or effort!” “The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R’s. Shame!” he continued. The President added, “I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).” Hours later, he walked back the slams — partway. “Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico,” he tweeted, in the first of a string of posts that heaped praise on local leaders who have been kinder than Cruz in their comments about his performance. “Great people!” Trump proceeded to boost Rossello, Mapp, and Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon – a fellow Republican. “Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor,” he posted at the end of his nine-tweet blast. “Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/30/trump-launches-personal-attack-on-mayor-amid-crisis-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
166,"Trump praises FEMA, military for Puerto Rico relief efforts",Mary Kay Linge,2017-09-30,"President Trump’s full-throated social media defense of his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria culminated in an evening tweet that praised FEMA workers and military personnel with an official-looking video. “Because of #FakeNews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job,” Trump posted at 6:46 pm. “As seen here, they are ALL doing a GREAT JOB!” The nearly 10-minute video included quotes of praise from Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, images of Marines clearing roads, and aerial footage of the island’s devastation. It closed with a Trump-signed message of support: “We are with you Puerto Rico! Together, we will get through this!” The president’s messages were echoed in unusually feisty tweets from Vice President Mike Pence and Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders that praised Trump, Rossello, and the FEMA response in a sharp pushback against a developing media narrative. Pence tweeted on his official Vice Presidential account at 6:18 p.m.: “With leadership of @POTUS & @ricardorossello – @FEMA & Team Puerto Rico making real progress. Millions more meals & water delivered today.” “For those who don’t let the truth get in the way of a good story here’s the actual timeline of massive federal response in Puerto Rico,” Sanders posted in a tweet that linked to a detailed FEMA-generated chart of its actions before and after the devastating storm.

167,"Beyond relief, Puerto Rico needs a path to prosperity",Post Editorial Board,2017-09-30,"Even before Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the island was in big trouble. So while the federal government will surely shell out billions to help rebuild, national and local leaders need to grapple with the larger issue of long-term stability. One in 10 Puerto Ricans moved away in the decade before Maria hit. The government was in receivership, having run up debts far beyond its ability to repay. Badly neglected maintenance is a major reason the electrical grid is entirely down: The also-bankrupt, publicly owned power company had devoted too many resources to keeping people employed at the expense of getting its core work done. And the island’s medical system depends on special subsidies from Washington that soon expire. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, a reformer looking to clean up the government and win US statehood for the island, only took office in January. Now he has to not only manage the immediate crisis but lead the way in ensuring that Puerto Rico has any real future. Notably, some mainlanders are now obsessing about ensuring that Puerto Rico’s power system be more green when it’s rebuilt, when the urgent need is plainly to make it more storm-resistant. Of course, outsiders often miss key issues. Last week began with lots of noise on the mainland about the need to suspend the Jones Act so that non-US-flagged ships could deliver relief shipments. As it happened, President Trump agreed to suspend the act right after Rosselló requested it. But then it turned out that cargo has piled up on the San Juan docks because so many roads are out and so few truck drivers are available. There’s a good case for exempting Puerto Rico permanently: The Jones Act restrictions clearly hit the island commonwealth harder than the mainland. But that’s not the only law to look at. Back in the 1970s, Congress decided to impose the federal minimum wage on Puerto Rico, though average wages are far lower there. A later National Bureau of Economic Research analysis found the change “substantially reduced employment on the island,” prompting mass migration of lower-skilled workers to the mainland. On the flip side, Congress in the ’90s ended most of the tax preferences that had attracted pharmaceutical companies to the island. Now it’s an open question whether Big Pharma will rebuild its remaining plants there post-Maria, or shift the work to Ireland. Some incentives to preserve those jobs for Americans may be in order. Then, too, a comprehensive recovery plan must consider the work of the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico, which noted a host of perverse ways federal law applies to the island — usually because it’s at most an afterthought to most lawmakers. We’re sure the president, on his coming visit, will commit to a better future for the 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The rest of Washington needs to wake up to the fact that fostering long-term prosperity is about more than just writing checks.

169,Trump plays defense as crisis grows in Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-29,"President Trump defended his administration’s response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Friday — by citing praise from the US territory’s governor. “Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: ‘The Administration and the President, every time we’ve spoken, they’ve delivered,'” Trump tweeted Friday morning. “The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!” he said in a separate tweet. Rossello on Friday said the administration has been responsive to aid requests, the Washington Examiner reported. “I have to say that the administration has responded to our petitions. FEMA, Brock Long, has been on the phone virtually all the time with me, checking out how things are going,” the governor said. “The different components of the national guard, military, FEMA and our government are working together on the priorities,” he said. Trump has been smarting amid criticisms about the federal government’s response to the growing humanitarian crisis on the island of 3.4 million people. “Puerto Rico is devastated. Phone system, electric grid many roads, gone. FEMA and First Responders are amazing. Governor said ‘great job!'” he tweeted Thursday. “FEMA & First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food & water delivered. Docks & electric grid dead. Locals trying really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!” he wrote earlier Thursday. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke — who plans to visit Puerto Rico on Friday — has said she was “very satisfied” with the federal response and that “the relief effort is under control.” On Thursday, Trump waived shipping restrictions to get fuel and supplies to the territory. Meanwhile, more than 150 New York state troopers, National Guard members and dozens of workers with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will head to Puerto Rico on Friday to help with relief efforts. A Delta humanitarian flight was scheduled to carry the large contingent – which includes medical workers and FEMA personnel – from JFK Airport to San Juan, the airline said in a statement. Members of the Port Authority’s Aviation Department will assist San Juan International Airport, where some passengers have been waiting for days to get a flight off the island. Port Authority workers also will help unload and prepare aid shipments at the port of San Juan. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced earlier this week that the state was sending additional personnel and supplies to help Puerto Rico’s recovery effort. New Jersey’s largest city also is sending police, firefighters and emergency management personnel to the US territory to help with the relief efforts. Newark’s Public Safety Department said it will deploy emergency personnel in three teams and coordinate efforts with the New Jersey State Police. On Friday, Delta plans to operate a total of nine flights to and from San Juan, in addition to the humanitarian flight. Puerto Rico was under a flash flood watch Friday — with heavy rain expected through the weekend, which “will aggravate the ongoing recovery and relief efforts,” the National Weather Service said. The US military is distributing 900 sandbags to shore up the Guajataca Dam after it sustained an infrastructure failure after the Category 4 storm hit and hundreds of people were evacuated, CNN reported. Federal officials say aid has been delivered across the island, but millions are still without electricity, water or gas. Many roads also are badly damaged or blocked.

170,This is the picture of Puerto Rico’s despair,Associated Press,2017-09-29,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Crowds jammed the cruise ship dock of San Juan on Thursday, desperately hoping to get on board the Royal Caribbean cruise ship the Adventure of the Seas, which was sent to help evacuate people struggling to find a way off Puerto Rico following the destruction of Hurricane Maria. More than 2,000 people sweltered in the hot sun, forming a line stretching down the shore and a pier. “We’ve been in this line forever and it is hot,” said Taylor McCloskey, who goes to school in Miami. She said she came to visit family in the US territory after Hurricane Irma shut down her school in Florida for three weeks, and then she got stranded in Puerto Rico when Maria hit last week. “I need to get back, I need to get back to my life,” she said. “There’s no water, no electricity. I don’t see anything coming anytime soon. It’s bad.” It wasn’t clear how many of those jamming the dock would get a spot on the ship. Puerto Rico officials said only about 800 of the 1,000 tourists caught on the island would be boarding, while the other passengers would be Puerto Ricans leaving the island or friends and family of Royal Caribbean employees. “We’ve been standing in line since 8 a.m.,” said Cara Rookwood of Philadelphia. “We have been trying to get on this supposed list that they have via email. I called my father and had him email the list but I don’t think they’re taking any more reservations at this point. But I’m getting a lot of conflicting information.” Rookwood and her husband, Davin Safer, were on the island of Vieques when the storm crashed in, and could not find a way back to Puerto Rico for several days, until they finally were given a ride on a private plane. Safer said he has never experienced anything like the aftermath of the hurricane, which knocked out electricity across Puerto Rico, shut down businesses, blocked roads and ports, and left the island’s 3.8 million people scrambling to find water, food and other necessities. “Coming from a fairly normal stable background, I’ve never imagined that there could be so little security in America,” he said. His wife added, “It’s been a strange, longer-than-normal vacation.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/29/thousands-of-puerto-ricans-line-dock-hoping-for-place-on-cruise-ship/,New York Post,Conservative
123,Trump admin pushes back against accusations of slow response to Puerto Rico crisis,,2017-09-29,"President Donald Trump on Thursday declared relief efforts for Puerto Rico are succeeding, nine days after Hurricane Maria hit -- despite critics' claims that people on the island have been waiting too long for aid.The president cleared the way Thursday for more supplies and tweeted that relief was indeed getting through.Trump issued a 10-day waiver of federal restrictions on foreign shipments of cargo to the island. And, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief account would get a $6.7 billion boost by the end of the week.On Friday, Trump again defended the government's response and said ""big decisions"" will have to be made.The developments unfolded after Trump came under sharp criticism for what critics said was a too-slow response to a humanitarian crisis among Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents.“FEMA & First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food & water delivered. Docks & electric grid dead. Locals trying,” Trump tweeted Thursday night, “...really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!”Trump and his advisers defended the administration’s response to the hurricane, which destroyed much of the island’s infrastructure and left many residents desperate for fresh water, power, food and other supplies.Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security adviser, told Fox News' “Special Report” the impression of a slow response isn’t so much wrong as it is outdated. He said more than 40 of the island’s 69 hospitals were now accepting patients.“Old reporting or old b-roll footage running from earlier today tends to give a bad impression. It wasn't wrong at the time it was recorded. It just ends up being dated and inaccurate, so that's the challenge for all of us,” Bossert told Bret Baier.“The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site,” Trump tweeted early in the day.But in many cases “on site” meant stored on pallets and in containers in sea- and airports far from the towns where Puerto Ricans desperately lined up for fresh water and pre-made meals being distributed by federal officials.Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said she signed the waiver of a federal law to clear the way for foreign-flagged ships to deliver supplies between U.S. ports. The nearly century-old measure, known as the Jones Act, has bolstered the U.S. shipping industry but made consumer goods much pricier and scarcer in this U.S. territory than on the mainland.“You are seeing devastation in Puerto Rico. That is the fault of the hurricane,” Duke told reporters in the White House driveway. “The relief effort is under control.”Duke had waived the Jones Act earlier this month to help ease fuel shortages in the Southeast following hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That order included Puerto Rico but expired last week, shortly after Maria struck.DECORATED ARMY GENERAL TO LEAD U.S. MILITARY RECOVERY IN PUERTO RICOThe Trump administration initially said a waiver was not needed for Puerto Rico because there were enough U.S.-flagged ships available to ferry goods to the island.Meanwhile, the U.S. military was sending a three-star general to Puerto Rico to help direct the hurricane response. Lt. Gen. Jeff Buchanan, commander of U.S. Army North, was to arrive later Thursday to assess the situation so that the military can provide the highest level of support for the disaster, Northern Command spokesman John Cornelio said.He said there were still problems getting supplies and aid to residents on the island, where 12 of the 29 bridges that have been assessed were closed, and another 65 were damaged.Cornelio also said that the number of open gas stations has increased from about 400 to 676. FEMA officials said a million meals and 2 million liters of fresh water had been distributed in Puerto Rico and 2 million more meals and 2 million more liters of water were on the way.Presidential spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said 10,000 government workers, including more than 7,000 troops, were helping Puerto Rico recover.The Department of Homeland Security’s acting administrator of the region that includes Puerto Rico said that distribution had been hampered by the destruction of roads and bridges, which made it hard to get supplies to those in need.“In addition to building that first line of the supply chain, we are also rebuilding the entire distribution system ... how we’re going to deliver commodities and resources to the people of Puerto Rico,” acting administrator John Rabin told reporters in the capital, San Juan. “We have often had to recreate the system in order to deliver food, water and commodities throughout the island.”And FEMA Administrator Brock Long said the efforts have been hampered by damaged airports and ports on the island.“The question is that last mile,” said Long, speaking of the difficulty of getting aid all the way to those in need.Meanwhile, Ryan announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief account would get “a huge capital injection” of $6.7 billion by the end of the week to help Puerto Rico recover. He noted that Trump had waived a matching funds requirement, which means the cash-strapped island won’t have to contribute to the initial costs of the federal assistance. The Wisconsin Republican said he expects the Trump administration to send Congress a request for a long-term recovery package once damage assessments are conducted.AIRLINE, BREWERY TEAM UP TO FLY CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO PUERTO RICO“We will quickly act on that request,” Ryan said.Outside the capital, San Juan, residents, though, were very much in doubt.“I have not received any help, and we ran out of food yesterday,” said Mari Olivo, a 27-year-old homemaker whose husband was pushing a shopping cart with empty plastic gallon jugs while their two children, 9 and 7, each toted a large bucket. They stood in line in a parking lot in the town of Bayamon on the hard-hit northern coast, where police used hoses to fill up containers from a city water truck.“I have not seen any federal help around here,” said Javier San Miguel, a 51-year-old accountant.Bayamon Mayor Ramon Luis Rivera told The Associated Press that FEMA officials sent a truck with a limited amount of food on Monday. Rivera said he began distributing it to hard-hit rural areas.“I don’t wait,” he said when asked whether federal officials helped with distribution..",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-pushes-back-against-accusations-of-slow-response-to-puerto-rico-crisis,Fox,Conservative
168,"Cops harassed, assaulted couple after Puerto Rico fundraiser: suit",Julia Marsh,2017-09-29,"Cops profiled, harassed and assaulted a Manhattan attorney and his fiancée as they were leaving a Puerto Rican Bar Association event, according to a new lawsuit filed by the couple. “It shook my whole belief in the police. I have no trust in them,” Angel Antonio Castro III told The Post. Castro, 31, and his fiancée, Melody Ann Benitez, a 26-year-old director at the social justice nonprofit Ya-Ya Network, were leaving the association’s Chelsea Piers fundraiser at 10:30 p.m. on Sept. 29, 2016, when they were stopped by police officers. The cops said they matched the description of a male and female involved in a nearby domestic dispute. “Specifically the police officers alleged that the 911 dispatch center received a call regarding a woman wearing a white dress, just like Benitez, being pushed to the ground by an unidentified man in the area,” the Manhattan civil suit says. “Benitez, who did not have any visible marks on her clothing or body, denied that she’d been assaulted by Castro or any other male,” the suit says. “I explained to them, I was an attorney. I explained we’re upstanding citizens, you have no reason to be bothering us,” Castro recalled. He allowed the officer to speak to his fiancée alone but grew alarmed when more police arrived and “encircled” Benitez, according to Castro and court papers. Police officer Peter Marter allegedly started shining a flashlight in Benitez’s face as she tried to record the incident and then pushed her when she attempted to read his badge number, the suit says. Castro was able to record the encounter with his cell phone. An ambulance eventually arrived and EMS workers determined that Benitez hadn’t been assaulted but might have been intoxicated. Castro says she’d only had a few glasses of wine and was not drunk. Still, the ambulance took her to nearby Lenox Hill Hospital. The situation escalated when Castro followed his fiancée to the hospital, where she was naked and screaming, surrounding by cops and hospital staff, the suit says. He was then attacked by a hospital staffer. Officer Marter allegedly joined the fray, calling Castro a “s–c” and pummeling him, the suit says. “I was wearing a suit. They pulled my suit jacket over my head hockey-style and punched me in the head then they slammed me down onto the floor,” Castro said. “I kept screaming, ‘I’m not resisting,’” he said. He was charged with assault and disorderly conduct. The charges were dismissed in February, according to court papers. Benitez was not charged. The couple is suing for unspecified damages. Castro, who runs his own firm general practice firm A.A. Castro C.L.A.N. PLLC, said he hopes his case results in “de-escalation training” for officers. “It should have been a couple of words of conversation and then we’d be on the way home. Instead I spent the night in central booking. It was an absolute horror show,” he said. A city Law Department spokeswoman said, “We will review the complaint.” NYPD reps did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

171,Trump praises ‘massive’ US response to Puerto Rico crisis,Bob Fredericks,2017-09-29,"Facing mounting criticism of his administration’s response to the disaster in Puerto Rico, President Trump on Friday praised the US response to a hurricane he described as perhaps the worst in history. “People have never seen anything like this,” the president said, addressing a group of manufacturers in Washington. “We’ve undertaken a massive federal mobilization to assist Puerto Rico, including the presence of over 10,000 federal personnel, including 5,000 US military and National Guard personnel, led by a very, very strong and talented three-star general,” the president said, referring to Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan. “All appropriate departments of our government from Homeland Security to Defense are engaged fully in the disaster and the response and recovery effort, probably has never been seen for something like this.” The president repeated his contention that because the US territory is an island, mobilization has been a challenge. “This is an island surrounded by water. Big water, Ocean water,” he explained. “We’ve never seen a situation like this.” Puerto Rico’s local and territorial governments, he added, were “totally and unfortunately unable to handle this catastrophic crisis on their own – just totally unable to.“ He also again criticized the island’s power grid as antiquated, brought up the territory’s massive debt and questioned who would pay for the reconstruction. “Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort [which] will end up being one of the biggest ever, will be funded and organized and what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island,” Trump said. And he repeatedly emphasized the size of Hurricane Maria and what he called the massive US efforts to help. “Never been anything like this. So, there remains a lot of work to do and we will work with the folks that we’re working with right now. They’re trying very, very hard, I will tell you that. But nobody has ever seen anything like it,” the president said. After devoting scant attention to the Sept. 20 storm for days as he picked a fight with the NFL over national anthem, Trump has been vigorously defending the US effort and patting himself on the back for the response. He’s blamed the criticism on an unfair press, even as many Puerto Rican officials have pleaded for a quicker response, as most of the island remains without power amid shortages of food, water and medicine nine days after the storm.

172,Mayor slams official who called Puerto Rico crisis a ‘good news story’,Lia Eustachewich,2017-09-29,"San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz excoriated acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke over her “irresponsible” comments that Puerto Rico’s recovery in wake of Hurricane Maria was a “good news story.” “Damnit, this is not a good news story. This is a people-are-dying story,” Cruz fumed Friday on CNN after listening to a clip of Duke’s comments from the day before. “This is a life-or-death story.” Speaking to reporters outside the White House Thursday, an upbeat Duke said she was “satisfied” with the government’s response to the devastated US territory. “I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane,” she said. Clearly taken aback, Cruz implored Duke to come and visit the storm-ravaged island. “I’m sorry but that really upsets me and frustrates me,” Cruz said. “I would ask her to come down here and visit the towns and then make a statement like that, which, frankly, is an irresponsible statement.” The Trump administration has been on the defensive against criticism that it’s been slow to send aid to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria tore through last week, leaving at least 16 dead and knocking out power on the entire island. “Maybe from where she’s standing it’s a good news story,” Cruz said. “When you’re drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story. When you don’t have food for a baby, it’s not a good news story.” About 9,500 containers carrying supplies was stuck at the Port of San Juan Thursday as the island’s 3.4 million residents faced another day of food, fuel and water shortages. “This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen,” Cruz added. On Friday, Trump — who a day earlier waived shipping restrictions to send relief to the island — defended his administration’s response. “Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: ‘The Administration and the President, every time we’ve spoken, they’ve delivered,’” Trump tweeted Friday morning.

173,Trump lifts shipping restrictions for Puerto Rico relief,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-28,"President Trump on Thursday waived shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, the White House announced. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that the president, at the request of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, “has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately.” The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between US ports be carried by American-owned and -operated ships. The announcement came shortly after Rossello told CNBC that he was seeking lines of credit at “reasonable rates” from the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury to rebuild the island. The governor said he had yet to receive a commitment for new loans to help pay the cleanup and eventual rebuilding costs. The US territory, which was slammed by Hurricane Maria eight days ago, expects “equal treatment” to hurricane-stricken Florida and Texas when it comes to allocating relief resources, he said. Puerto Rico was already facing a financial crisis before the Category 4 storm struck. Its government was in the middle of negotiations with creditors to restructure part of its $73 billion in debt, which the previous governor had declared unpayable. Sending relief supplies to the island has been difficult because they can only be transported by air or sea — but Rossello told CNBC on Thursday that the deliveries are improving. The commonwealth’s power grid was destroyed, leaving almost the entire island in the dark. Diesel fuel, which is desperately needed for generators, is scarce. The communications infrastructure also has been obliterated, leading Rossello to deploy “runners” to report back on the needs of the various towns and cities. He said he’s also “personally deploying” satellite phones to mayors across the island. Rossello said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been responsive — with federal and local first responders working as “one team.” He said he spoke to Trump late Wednesday, and that the White House and Congress have been “responsive” to Puerto Rico’s plight. Trump — who plans to visit the island Tuesday — earlier this week defended his administration’s handling of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. On Tuesday, he offered an excuse for why aid has been slow to arrive on the island. “It’s very tough, because it’s an island,” Trump said during a meeting with members of the House.

The three-star general, who served four tours in Iraq, is expected to travel Thursday to Puerto Rico, where the military is trying to better coordinate the distribution of supplies to residents, CNN reported. Thousands of containers of relief supplies have been languishing on the island’s main port in San Juan thanks to a shortage of truck drivers and badly-damaged roads. Sen. Marco Rubio said Thursday that the Department of Defense should take over recovery efforts and help island authorities distribute aid to desperate residents. “The only people who can restore it, who have the capacity to do so quickly in the short term, and then turn it over to the authorities there in Puerto Rico, is the Department of Defense,” Rubio said. “We need someone in charge of that with the know-how of logistics, with the capability to restore logistics and with the authority to make decisions quickly without having to check with 18 agencies.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/28/three-star-general-to-spearhead-relief-efforts-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
175,Aid sent to Puerto Rico not reaching desperate residents,Danika Fears,2017-09-28,"President Trump on Thursday waived shipping restrictions to get fuel and supplies to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico — but aid that’s already there hasn’t been reaching desperate residents. “There are plenty of ships and plenty of cargo to come into the island,” said Mark Miller, a spokesman for shipping company Crowley, which has 3,000 containers of supplies in the US territory. “From there, that’s where the supply chain breaks down — getting the goods from the port to the people on the island who need them,” he told Bloomberg News. Around 9,500 containers carrying supplies remained stuck at the Port of San Juan on Thursday, while the island’s 3.4 million residents faced another day of food, fuel and water shortages, waiting in hours-long lines to buy basic items. “Really, our biggest challenge has been the logistical assets to try to get some of the food and some of the water to different areas of Puerto Rico,” Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told MSNBC. Many roads on the island remain washed out or blocked by debris, and authorities have had trouble reaching out to truck drivers who can deliver supplies. “When we say that we don’t have truck drivers, we mean that we have not been able to contact them,” Rosselló said. More than a week after Hurricane Maria hit the island as a Category 4 storm, Trump waived the Jones Act — which requires that all goods shipped between US ports be carried by American-owned and -operated ships — for the next 10 days. “We are strengthening the distribution of supplies with federal collaboration,” Rosselló tweeted. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced Thursday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief account would receive another $6.7 billion by the end of the week. And the Pentagon said it was sending Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, a three-star general who served four tours in Iraq, to the island, where the military was trying to better coordinate the distribution of supplies to residents. Earlier in the day, Sen. Marco Rubio said that only the Defense Department could manage the logistics of getting aid distributed to residents quickly. “The only people who can restore it, who have the capacity to do so quickly in the short term and then turn it over to the authorities there in Puerto Rico, is the Department of Defense,” the Florida Republican told CNN. “We need someone in charge of that with the know-how of logistics, with the capability to restore logistics and with the authority to make decisions quickly without having to check with 18 agencies.” The Trump administration has been facing criticism over its response to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, with some charging that it was slow to react. “The federal response has been a disaster,” said lawmaker José Enrique Meléndez, a member of Rosselló’s New Progressive Party. “It’s been really slow.” But Trump’s advisers pushed back against those accusations Thursday, with acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke saying that she was “very satisfied” with the federal government’s response and that “the relief effort is under control.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said 10,000 federal relief workers were now stationed in Puerto Rico. “The full weight of the United States government is engaged to ensure that food, water, health care and other lifesaving resources are making it to the people in need,” she said. Of the island’s 69 hospitals, 44 are operational, officials said. Forty-four percent of Puerto Ricans remain without drinking water and most of the island is still without power. Pastor Irving Figueroa of the Wesleyan Church in the northern municipality of Guaynabo said islanders were desperate for food, water and medicine. “Parents with two or three kids at home, they need water, and they need milk and the basics in order to help their kids,” he told The Post. “This is a catastrophic situation.” Figueroa — whose church has been working with World Hope International to distribute supplies such as water filters, tarps and solar chargers — said people have been spending 10 to 11 hours in line just to buy gas. “There are 500 to 700 people all in line to get water from the places that the government are providing,” he explained. “This is the worst situation in our history. It’s like being in a military combat situation.” With Post wires ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/28/aid-sent-to-puerto-rico-not-reaching-desperate-residents/,New York Post,Conservative
124,US military's Puerto Rico recovery to be led by decorated Army general,Perry Chiaramonte,2017-09-28,"A three-star general with a solid record of leadership in the war zone was named on Thursday to spearhead the U.S. military's relief efforts in storm-scarred Puerto Rico.Lt. General Jeffrey Buchanan, from U.S. Army North, has been tasked by the Pentagon to oversee the federal recovery efforts in the Caribbean-based commonwealth and is expected to take over the island’s command center that has been set up at the Puerto Rico Convention Center in San Juan. The post comes as the Trump administration fights back against claims it's responded too slowly to the devastation triggered by Hurricane Maria just over a week ago.The appointment of Buchanan is intended to help speed that process along. The military effort on the island is expected to grow in the next few days.Craig Fugate, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the previous administration, told the Los Angeles Times that having a commander who reports to both the governor and the military chain of command will create a “unified team” of military and civilian disaster response units, adding that the relief effort in Puerto Rico has been hampered by a bottleneck of supplies at the Port of San Juan and downed roads. A dual-status commander can help clear up fallen infrastructure more quickly.Buchanan boasts an impressive military career with experience that could prove beneficial to expediting relief efforts.He has served four tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. In 2003-2004 he was the director of operations for the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team. He then went on to command the 2nd Brigade, 75th Division (TSB) and deployed to Iraq to serve as an advisor to the Iraqi Special Police Commando Division. Upon his return stateside, he served as the director of operations for U.S. Army North.Puerto Rico is in the throes of a full-blown ""humanitarian crisis,"" with washed-out roads, downed power lines and damaged infrastructure -- a scene President Trump intends to view first-hand next week.Trump said Tuesday the federal government has been working hard to get food and water to the U.S. territory, saying the island was “hit as hard as you can hit.”Last week Puerto Ricans hunkered down as Hurricane Maria raked the length of the island, killing at least 16 people, wrecking the electricity grid and grinding up homes, businesses, roads, and farms.After the storm passed, islanders set about digging out from the mud and debris slung by worst storm to hit the island in nearly a decade. They went in search of basic necessities: water, food, gas for a generator, a cell phone signal or a Wi-Fi hotspot to connect with relatives.All of that remains in very short supply a week later, and now many people on the island and around the world are wondering how long it will take for life to return to normal in the U.S. territory of 3.4 million.Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin, Lucia I.

176,US expected to lift shipping restrictions for Puerto Rico hurricane relief,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-27,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Wednesday he expected the federal government to waive the Jones Act, which would lift restrictions on ships that can provide aid to the island ravaged by Hurricane Maria. He said he has been speaking with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who have supported an emergency waiver. “We expect them to waive it,” Rosselló told CNN, noting that there was a seven-day waiver after Hurricane Irma, which was much less damaging to the US commonwealth. On Tuesday, Team Trump denied a request to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to Puerto Rico, saying it would do nothing to address the island’s damaged ports. A waiver would allow Puerto Rico to get assistance not only from American ships but from any vessels that can bring supplies to the island’s 3.4 million people, Reuters reported. “That is critical, particularly for fuel,” Rosselló said. “One of the consideration right now is the priority of getting fuel, diesel, gasoline, all across the island. Right now we have enough fuel. “We’re limited by the transportation logistics, but at some point of course, getting fuel into the island is going to be critical so that we can have the major functions of telecoms, hospitals, water, to be running appropriately,” he added. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between US ports to be carried by American owned-and-operated ships. The category 4 storm slammed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, killing at least 16 people, inflicting catastrophic damage and leaving nearly all of the island without power. About 97 percent of the island’s residents were still in the dark Wednesday, Rosselló told CNN. About half of them have no running water. On Wednesday, 3,500 pounds of water, military meals ready-to-eat, diapers and other supplies will be flown from Miami to Puerto Rico, Rob Brisley, a spokesman with US Customs and Border Protection, told CNN. “We are getting help from the federal government, but this is an unprecedented set of circumstances,” Rosselló said Wednesday. “We want to make sure that we recognize that a lot of resources are coming in. They are coming in by air or by boats. But they are starting to execute.” Meanwhile, a group of top US electric company executives said the island faces a long, complicated power restoration process. Damage assessments must be done to determine what human and equipment resources will be required to restore power, the CEO-led Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council said in a release, Reuters reported. The ESCC is coordinating the power restoration efforts between the US government and the electric power sector. Its members include the American Public Power Association, which represents companies like the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which serves all 1.5 million electrical customers on Puerto Rico. “We thank President Trump for authorizing 100-percent cost sharing by the federal government for 180 days of emergency work to help begin the process of repairing damaged energy infrastructure,” said APPA chief Sue Kelly, Reuters reported Trump — whose administration was mostly praised for its response to hurricanes that battered Texas and Florida — has come under fire for his slow response in Puerto Rico during days of tweeting about the NFL. When he finally turned his attention to the devastated island, he appeared to blame its plight on internal turmoil, as well as its “massive debt” to “Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.” On Tuesday, Trump offered an excuse for why aid has been slow to arrive on the island. “It’s very tough, because it’s an island,” Trump said during a meeting with members of the House. “In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there. And you know, we’ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and on Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico,” he said. “But the difference is, this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. And it’s a big ocean; it’s a very big ocean. And we’re doing a really good job.” He later announced that he will visit Puerto Rico, as well as the US Virgin Islands, on Tuesday – saying it was the earliest he could get there without affect recovery efforts.

177,Puerto Rico’s stray dog packs all killed by hurricane,Jennifer Gould,2017-09-27,"The dogs ran wild on so-called “Dead Dog Beach” in Puerto Rico — abused and then abandoned by their owners. Then the hurricane hit, and the feral dogs were washed away. None survived. Christina Beckles, a New Yorker who founded a nonprofit to save the slum dogs of Puerto Rico, flew to the devastated island after the hurricane to assist her staff at the Sato Project and whatever dogs they could help. But the situation is far worse, and more dangerous, than she could have imagined. “Once the hugs and tears were over, the first thing we all wanted to do was go to the beach to look for our feral dogs,” Beckles wrote on Facebook. “Sadly, we did not find them and our hearts are heavy with the reality upon seeing the utter devastation at the beach — they did not survive.” The island of 3.4 million people is without electricity, and water, and looters have taken over as police and the National Guard enforce a strict 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew — leaving Americans in chaos, abandoned by their government. “It’s a war zone,” Beckles said by email. “There is no power or water. We are under curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Food is becoming scarce and people are getting desperate. Looting has already begun. The lines to get gas are seven to ten hours long — to receive $10 worth of gas.” Beckles’ own home in Puerto Rico was also destroyed. “It has a tree on it and is 6 feet under water,” she said. “The water became contaminated a few days after the storm. The Mayor of San Juan evacuated the area on Saturday due to the serious health issue the water now presents.” Her home was filled with raw sewage when she returned Tuesday. “We had to wade through thigh high black water to get to it. Everything we own is gone,” she said. “Today, Wednesday, we went back and the water level has now RISEN. It has not been raining here. There is a park at the end of our block that was flooded and it was pumped out two days ago. Why pump the water out of a park yet leave an entire neighborhood under sewer water? I am not trying to single myself out – I am acutely aware that there are thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of people that have lost everything. They ALL need help now.” Beckles said that throughout the tragedy, the sense of community is heartening. “The majority of people are coming together and helping each other. Neighbors are the ones cleaning the streets and moving debris. I feel an incredible sense of community,” she wrote by email. “Hospitals are running on generators and they are running out of fuel. Yet the largest mall on the island already has power.” She added that the hurricane hit directly on Dead Dog Beach in Yabucoa. “The municipality suffered the loss of 99% of their buildings. We were caring for 3 feral dogs there and they have not been seen since 9/19,” she wrote. “Our team visited the beach yesterday and upon seeing the devastation we believe at this time those dogs have perished. We have rescued three dogs since the hurricane – all dumped during the storm. One is heavily pregnant and was with a small puppy.” She was told by a security guard for the hotel at the beach that the dogs “were screaming in terror.” “They are now safe in our care and will be transported off the island on Friday.” Beckles said that in the first few days after the hurricane, it seemed things might be fine — but help never came. “We are now 7 days in and nothing is happening. How can anyone feel safe with a curfew in place and looting going on?” she said. The mayor of San Juan has warned people to stay indoors and not violate the curfew for their own safety.

178,Puerto Rico should have been ready for Maria,Eddie Borges,2017-09-27,"El Coquí, the 1-inch musical tree frog that is Puerto Rico’s cultural icon, has more common sense than the island’s public officials. When rising temperatures made the coast uninhabitable and caused the extinction of many of their species, the survivors moved up to the mountains, where it was cooler. Meanwhile, nearly 70 percent of the island’s human population and all of its power plants are still on Puerto Rico’s coast. This raises two questions. Why didn’t island officials, like Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto, prepare for a disaster they knew was coming? And how did Puerto Rico spend several hundred million dollars in US taxpayer-funded FEMA grants? The end of the tree frog’s nightly concert was just the first sign of looming catastrophe. When I visited the island in 2013 after a decade’s absence, the first thing I noticed was the virtual disappearance of the wide beaches for which Puerto Rico was once famous. According to the US Geological Survey, they were washing away at a rate of 3.3 feet per year. Then in 2013 came a more prosaic warning in the form of a report from the Puerto Rican Climate Change Council and the USGS. It stated: “It is no longer a question of whether the coasts of Puerto Rico and many port cities in the Caribbean will be inundated, but rather, it is a question of when and by how much.” But history itself should’ve served as warning enough. Between 1956 and 1996, there were 12 disaster declarations from hurricanes and flooding in Puerto Rico. Over the last 20 years there have been 15. FEMA has provided nearly a billion dollars in disaster relief to Puerto Rico since 1998. By now, you’d think Puerto Rico would be prepared. Instead, Mayor Cruz told the Washington Post, “People are starting to tell us ‘I don’t have my medication. I don’t have my insulin. I don’t have my blood pressure medication. I don’t have food. I don’t have drinking water.’ ” Puerto Rico’s El Vocero newspaper published a similar quote following Hurricane Hugo in 1989. There was “a lack of and delay in obtaining essential services and resources: for example, sanitary facilities, beds, food, water, prescription drugs, and health services . . . San Juan metropolitan area suffered from a lack of water for nine days.” Old newspaper reports are not the only sources for what Puerto Rico could expect when a major hurricane hit. Government agencies publish post-incident reports following every hurricane. Many of them are available online. We know some Puerto Rican officials must have reviewed at least some of them. They would have used the information provided in these reports to win $300 million from FEMA’s hazard mitigation program. But instead of relocating families whose homes were damaged by Hurricane Georges in 1999, two-thirds of the funding went to rebuilding their homes in the same location. Cruz ended her interview with the Washington Post with, “Don’t forget us.” We won’t — for long, anyway. The cycle rolls on: Puerto Rico gets hit by a major hurricane. The island is devastated. There is flooding. The power grid gets knocked out for weeks, if not months. The federal government sends billions of dollars for cleanup and repairs. Then the next hurricane hits and the cycle starts all over again. In between hurricanes, public officials never get around to relocating the population or power plants inland, away from the disappearing coast. This is lunacy. The federal government has already spent billions in this century shoring up and rebuilding coastal communities. We already knew Puerto Rico has no capacity for managing its finances. Now we also know Puerto Rico has no capacity for planning and protecting its citizens — who are also American citizens. It’s time officials followed the coquí’s example, learned from Puerto Rico’s history and help residents continue to live on this island as the waters rise around them. The answer isn’t to simply write another blank check — which local profiteers are drooling to get their hands on. If the priority is to get the power grid up and running again, that’s a job for the Army Corps of Engineers, not for the power company that sited all its power plants on the coast. More broadly, the United States must develop a real climate-change coastal plan. It can start testing solutions in Puerto Rico. Eddie Borges negotiated a climate-change action plan with the office of the governor of Puerto Rico, on behalf of the Save El Coquí campaign, in 2013.

179,Trump says shipping industry opposed to waiver for Puerto Rico,Ruth Brown,2017-09-27,"President Trump says he’s reluctant to lift shipping restrictions to get more aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico — because mariners don’t want him to. “We’re thinking about that,” Trump said Wednesday when asked about lifting the Jones Act, which prohibits foreign ships from moving goods between US ports. “But we have a lot of shippers and a lot of people that work in the shipping industry that don’t want the Jones Act lifted, and we have a lot of ships out there right now.” The law was lifted for both Florida and Texas after they were hit with hurricanes earlier this month, but the government on Monday denied a similar reprieve for Puerto Rico, where millions are without fuel and drinking water. Puerto Rican pols and some mainland lawmakers argue the restrictions are stemming the flow of aid to the island, and forcing residents to pay a huge premium on goods. But the Department of Homeland Security has argued the US territory doesn’t have the infrastructure to dock more boats — and those in the industry say it will rob US citizens of work. “[The waiver] would take American first responders out of the loop and replace them with Filipino or Russian or Chinese crews,” Michael Roberts, a senior vice president at Florida’s Crowley Maritime Inc., told the Wall Street Journal. “Doing that at a time when many US mariners in this region have had their homes damaged, their lives uprooted and now they need to work, to take that away is not something you want to do.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/27/trump-says-shipping-industry-opposed-to-waiver-for-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
125,Scope of Puerto Rico damage so wide that US aid hard to see,,2017-09-27,"MONTEBELLO, Puerto Rico  Relatives helped Maribel Valentin Espino find shelter when Hurricane Maria roared through her community in northern Puerto Rico. Neighbors formed volunteer brigades to cut fallen trees and clear twisty mountain roads after the storm had passed. Now, friends and a local cattle ranch provide the water they need to survive in the tropical heat.Valentin and her husband say they have not seen anyone from the Puerto Rican government, much less the Federal Emergency Management Agency, since the storm tore up the island Sept. 20, killing at least 16 people and leaving nearly all 3.4 million people in Puerto Rico without power and most without water.""People say FEMA is going to help us,"" Valentin said Tuesday as she showed Associated Press journalists around the sodden wreckage of her home. ""We're waiting.""Many others are also waiting for help from anyone from the federal or Puerto Rican government. But the scope of the devastation is so broad, and the relief effort so concentrated in San Juan, that many people from outside the capital say they have received little to no help.Valentin, her husband and teenage son live in one such area, Montebello, a 20-minute drive into what used to be lushly forested mountains near the northern coastal municipality of Manati. Hurricane Maria's Category 4 winds stripped the trees bare and scattered them like matchsticks. ""It seemed like a monster,"" she recalled.The roads are passable now but the community is still isolated. ""Nobody has visited, not from the government, not from the city, no one,"" said Antonio Velez, a 64-year-old who has lived there his entire life.The same complaint echoed throughout the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa, the first town Maria hit as it barreled across the island with 155 mph winds.""Nothing, nothing, nothing,"" said 58-year-old retiree Angel Luis Rodriguez. ""I've lost everything, and no one has shown up to see if anyone lives here.""At a nearby river, dozens of people gathered to bathe and wash clothes as they grumbled about the lack of aid.""There's been no help from the mayor or from the federal government,"" said 64-year-old retiree Maria Rodriguez as she held a coconut in her right hand and took sips from it. ""After Georges hit us (in 1998), they responded quickly. But now? Nothing. We need water and food.""Nearby, one girl engaged in a thumb war with a friend as she filled an empty water bottle with her other hand. Downstream, a woman sat cross-legged in the water behind a friend and helped wash her hair.The recovery in the first week since the storm has largely been a do-it-yourself affair. People collect water from wells and streams, clear roads and repair their own homes when they are not waiting in day-long lines for gasoline and diesel. For most, the only visible sign of authority are police officers directing traffic, a critical service because traffic lights are out across the island.""I have seen a lot of helicopters go by. I assume those are people from FEMA,"" said Jesus Argilagos, who lives in Manati and works at a grocery store that is only open part of the day because of the power crisis. ""People get pissed off because they see them going back and forth and not doing anything.""There are several thousand U.S. federal employees in Puerto Rico helping with the recovery effort. They are most visible in San Juan, where officials with FEMA, Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection have a presence at hotels that before the storm served tourists in the Condado neighborhood or at the convention center that has become a staging ground for relief efforts.Federal workers supplied diesel to generators at hospitals and delivered desperately needed food and water to hard-hit communities across the island. They have repaired the air traffic control systems and power at the airport, which is receiving about 100 flights a day but is still far from normal operations. U.S. agents have also provided security across the island and the Coast Guard has worked with local authorities to restore the sea ports, a vital link because Puerto Rico is almost completely dependent on imports.In addition, teams from the Army Corps of Engineers are helping to repair the electricity grid and to inspect and look for ways to avert the collapse of a dam near the western town of Quebradillas that has developed a crack and that officials have said could potentially fail. And personnel from Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs have provided care and helped evacuate people from Puerto Rico with chronic medical conditions.Teams also were scheduled to visit the central mountain town of Aibonito, which was cut off from the rest of the island for five days. Many people began rationing their food and water supplies as they dwindled, unclear of when they would have contact with the outside world.""We thought somebody was going to stop by,"" said Ana Lidia Mendoza, a 48-year-old cook at a barbecue restaurant who lost part of her roof. ""They told us that we had to stay calm.""Gov. Ricardo Rossello and Resident Commissioner Jennifer Gonzalez, the island's representative in Congress, have said they intend to seek more than a billion dollars in federal assistance and they have praised the response to the disaster by President Donald Trump, who plans to visit Puerto Rico next week, as well as FEMA Administrator Brock Long.""I am confident that they understand the seriousness of the situation,"" the governor said Tuesday.Still, it is hard to avoid the fact that the response looks different than previous ones. After hurricanes in Louisiana, Texas and Florida, waves of power company trucks from other states descended in long convoys, something that is obviously not possible on an island 1,000 miles to the southeast of the mainland. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, the U.S. military sent ships and the skies seemed to be filled with heavy-lift helicopters and planes carrying emergency relief, though the scale of that disaster was far worse.Hurricane Maria was the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 100 years and officials say the cost of recovery will dwarf that of the punishing Hurricane Georges in 1998. Whatever the final bill, Valentin just hopes it will factor in people like her.

127,A conservative case for Puerto Rico statehood,Jorge Bonilla,2017-09-26,"Partisan politics is far less predicated on doing the right thing at the right time than on doing the things that will help garner (and subsequently hold) political power. It is important to understand this when Republicans and conservatives ask what the pending admission to the Union of the United States’ largest, state-sized territory, Puerto Rico, would “bring to the table”.What Puerto Rico has already brought over the course of 119 years as an unincorporated territory are significant contributions to the national defense, as well as to our nation’s rich cultural patrimony. Instead of lobbing pro-forma objections to statehood such as Puerto Rico’s massive structural debt (which would necessarily be resolved prior to admission), we on the right should begin to ask ourselves what might happen if Congress were to ignore (or worse, reject) Puerto Rico’s vote in support of statehood.One objection mindlessly bandied about within conservative circles is the fallacy that admitting Puerto Rico automatically adds five liberals to the House and two liberal senators. The House has been frozen in place at 435 seats since 1929, pursuant to the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929. We didn’t add any new House seats for the respective admissions of Alaska and Hawaii, thus, we wouldn’t add any new seats for Puerto Rico unless that statute were to be repealed.Such House seats would likely be apportioned over from liberal states with declining populations (such as Illinois or New York), and Puerto Rico has actually shown an ability to elect Republicans to federal office. If you are a House Republican, wouldn’t you rather trade Luis Gutierrez for Luis Fortuño?If you are a Republican - whether an elected official, a member of the Consultariat, or a member of conservative media - know that what you gain by supporting Puerto Rican statehood is simply this: the continued stability of the Electoral College, of the makeup of Congress, and of the region.Congressional rejection of the expressed democratic will of Puerto Rican voters would only lead to the island’s political implosion, pushing anywhere from 500,000 to 700,000 residents to the mainland...mostly, mind you, to Florida and Texas. And when they arrive to these warm-weather states, Democrat operatives will be awaiting these fleeing Puerto Ricans with open arms, blank voter registration forms, and grievance propaganda directed at the evil congressional Republicans that forced them off the island- with no ready GOP response.Pop quiz, hotshots: if you truly believe the nativist spiel about Puerto Ricans and their politics, would you rather contain that potential fallout to five House seats and two out of 102 Senate seats, or do you risk majorities in Congress and in the Electoral College?Independence, you say? Why not just have Congress rid itself of Puerto Rico with a unilateral grant of independence once the nasty debt stuff is all sorted out? Don’t even think about it, unless you want to push that earlier 700,000 figure to 1.3 million. On its best day at the ballot box, independence has never garnered more than five percent of the vote on the island, and even failed to crack one percent in last month’s status vote.Besides, given the ideological proclivities of the pro-independence movement, it is highly likely that an independent Puerto Rico would not be free for long, and swiftly fall into the Castro-Maduro axis of influence. If our national security matters to you, then stop and seriously consider the implications of creating another Marxist vassal state with 5 or 6 million of its descendants living on American soil and embedded within all levels of society and government.Over the course of multiple free and fair elections, the people of Puerto Rico have expressed their desire to join the Union as the 51st state. Although circumstances bar a hasty admission, it is time for Congress to do the right thing. I am hopeful that my Republican friends, moved to recognize and defend the legitimate civil rights of over 3 million Americans, will soon see that the greatest risks lie in continuing to do nothing.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/a-conservative-case-for-puerto-rico-statehood,Fox,Conservative

129,FEMA head says more ships and troops headed to Puerto Rico,,2017-09-26,"WASHINGTON  The Trump administration said Tuesday it was sending a flotilla of ships and thousands more military personnel to Puerto Rico to address the growing humanitarian crisis caused by Hurricane Maria.The administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, said the devastation wrought by the Category 4 storm presented logistical challenges, with badly damaged airports and seaports making it difficult to get aid and personnel to the stricken island.Long said 16 Navy and Coast Guard ships were in the waters around Puerto Rico, with 10 more ships on the way. They include the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship. Planes and ships were also bringing in a military force numbering in the thousands to help distribute aid. Military aircraft were dropping food and water to areas of the island still isolated and unable to receive help by road, he said.""We're dramatically increasing the federal footprint that's there,"" Long said, speaking outside the White House.The shift, six days after the storm made landfall, came amid a growing chorus of criticism that the federal response so far had been insufficient and fallen far short of the responses to hurricanes Harvey and Irma.The Pentagon said the number of active duty military personnel would grow from about 2,500 to possibly double that number in the next several days.An Army brigadier general will take over command of the military response, which will include additional medical facilities and satellite communications equipment, said John Cornelio, spokesman at U.S. Northern Command. The USNS Comfort is expected to leave Baltimore by Saturday and arrive in Puerto Rico three to five days later.The military response also will include a civil affairs unit from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that will be used to help communicate with the residents on the island, Cornelio said. The unit will use loudspeakers, trucks, leaflets and text messaging to get needed information to the public.Additional national guard forces are also being sent in to provide more security on the island. Those forces will be under the command of the governor, and could be used around fuel access points where there have been some security problems.Long said the federal government has provided 4 million ready-to-eat meals and 6 million liters of water. That would account for less than a day's supply for each of the island's 3.4 million U.S. citizens.Large sections of the territory remained without adequate food, water and fuel Tuesday. Flights off the island were infrequent, communications were spotty and roads were clogged with debris. Officials said electrical power may not be fully restored for more than a month.Long stressed that coordinating the response in Puerto Rico offered greater challenges than FEMA faced after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Hurricane Irma hit Florida.""It's an island. We don't just drive trucks and resources onto an island,"" Long said, stressing that all supplies had to cross hundreds of miles of water to get to the U.S. territory. He said relief efforts were initially hampered by damage to air traffic control systems at the airport in San Juan, limiting the flow of government and commercial flights. Federal personnel were now working to repair two other airfields, he said, to increase the capacity to bring in supplies by air.He also suggested Puerto Rico was less able to withstand and recover from the storm than the U.S. states on the mainland.""The infrastructure is weak, and there were no building codes, so there is a lot of devastation,"" Long said. ""Unfortunately, because of the severity of the hit, there is diminished capacity of local governments and state government to respond similar to what we saw with Texas and Florida.""Long also warned people not involved with the relief effort to stay away.""If you're going to Puerto Rico right now, it should be for only a life-sustaining, life-support mission,"" he said. ""Because everybody that's trying to get in that's not supporting that is getting in the way.""___Associated Press writer Lolita C.

128,"Trump tweets about Puerto Rico problems, as feds rush aid",,2017-09-26,"WASHINGTON  The U.S. ramped up its response Monday to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, even as President Donald Trump brought up the island's struggles before Hurricane Maria struck — including ""billions of dollars"" in debt to ""Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.""The Trump administration has tried to blunt criticism that its response to Hurricane Maria has fallen short of its efforts in Texas and Florida after the recent hurricanes there.Five days after the Category 4 storm slammed into Puerto Rico, many of the more than 3.4 million U.S. citizens in the territory were still without adequate food, water and fuel. Flights off the island were infrequent, communications were spotty and roads were clogged with debris. Officials said electrical power may not be fully restored for more than a month.The president said Tuesday that he plans to visit Puerto Rico next week, the earliest he said he can go without disrupting recovery operations.Trump pointed out some differences between the two states and the island in a series of tweets Monday night.""Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.""Trump also noted that the island's electrical grid was already ""in terrible shape."" Still, he promised, ""Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well.""In Washington, officials said no armada of U.S. Navy ships was headed to the island because supplies could be carried in more efficiently by plane. The Trump administration ruled out temporarily setting aside federal restrictions on foreign ships' transportation of cargo, saying it wasn't needed. The government had waived those rules in Florida and Texas until last week.Though the administration said the focus on aid was strong, when two Cabinet secretaries spoke at a conference on another subject — including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose agency is helping restore the island's power — neither made any mention of Puerto Rico or Hurricane Maria.Democratic lawmakers with large Puerto Rican constituencies back on the mainland characterized the response so far as too little and too slow. The confirmed death toll from Maria jumped to at least 49 on Monday, including 16 in Puerto Rico.""Puerto Ricans are Americans,"" said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who traveled to Puerto Rico over the weekend to assess the damage. ""We cannot and will not turn our backs on them.""The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, and White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert landed in San Juan on Monday, appearing with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello at a news briefing. Though Rossello had urgently called for more emergency assistance over the weekend, he expressed his gratitude for the help so far.The governor said the presence of Long and Bossert was ""a clear indication that the administration is committed with Puerto Rico's recovery process.""Long said, ""We've got a lot of work to do. We realize that.""Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made no mention of Puerto Rico or the hurricane during a joint appearance before the National Petroleum Council, a business-friendly federal advisory committee. News reporters were not allowed to ask questions.Perry had traveled with Trump to Texas and Florida following hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Energy Department crews are working in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, coordinating with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, FEMA and a team from the New York Power Authority, among others. An eight-member team from the Western Area Power Authority, an Energy Department agency, assisted with initial damage assessments in Puerto Rico and has been redeployed to St. Thomas. A spokeswoman said additional responders would go to Puerto Rico as soon as transportation to the hurricane-ravaged island could be arranged.Zinke's department oversees the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with other territories.The federal response to Maria faces obvious logistical challenges beyond those in Texas or Florida. Supplies must be delivered by air or sea, rather than with convoys of trucks.FEMA said it had more than 700 staff on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They were helping coordinate a federal response that now includes more than 10,000 federal personnel spread across the two Caribbean archipelagos.In Puerto Rico, federal workers supplied diesel to fuel generators at hospitals and delivered desperately needed food and water to hard-hit communities across the island. Cargo flights are bringing in additional supplies, and barges loaded with more goods are starting to arrive in the island's ports.San Juan's international airport handled nearly 100 arrivals and departures on Sunday, including military and relief operations, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Pentagon dispatched the Navy amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge, which provided helicopters and Marines to help with the relief effort onshore.However, the Trump administration said Monday it would not waive federal restrictions on foreign ships' transportation of cargo as it had following Harvey and Irma. The administration said it will continue to enforce the Jones Act, which requires that goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flagged ships.Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan said the agency had concluded there were already enough US-flagged vessels available.On Capitol Hill, congressional leaders were talking about how to pay for it all. Puerto Rico was already struggling from steep financial and economic challenges before Maria made landfall.Last year, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi joined with President Barack Obama to help recession-ravaged Puerto Rico deal with its debt crisis. After the devastating storm, Puerto Ricans will now be eligible to benefit from the same pots of federal emergency disaster aid and rebuilding funds available to residents in Texas and Florida.Lawmakers approved a $15 billion hurricane relief packaged after Harvey hit Texas, but billions more will likely now be needed to respond to Maria.Ryan said Monday that Congress will ensure the people of Puerto Rico ""have what they need.""___Associated Press reporters Ben Fox in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Jill Colvin, Robert Burns, Matthew Daly, Joan Lowy and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed.___Follow Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-tweets-about-puerto-rico-problems-as-feds-rush-aid,Fox,Conservative
183,This plea for help in Puerto Rico is heartbreaking,Joe Tacopino,2017-09-25,"A desperate plea for help was scrawled on a street in a storm-devastated coastal town in Puerto Rico — “S.O.S. We need water/food!!” The heartbreaking plea, written in Spanish in Punta Santiago, was captured during a helicopter flyover by the Caribbean Primate Research Center. The group of scientists, from the University of Puerto Rico, have a research station based on a small island off the coast of Punta Santiago. That island, as well as Puerto Rico, were ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Colleagues of the Caribbean research center said the employees there are in dire need of help.

130,Fears of dam failure persist in Puerto Rico as officials work to restore power following Maria’s wrath,,2017-09-25,"Emergency officials in Puerto Rico continue to monitor the damaged Guajataca Dam located in the northwestern part of the island as it remains at risk for failure following the devastating impacts of Hurricane Maria.On Sunday, the National Weather Service in San Juan extended the flash flood warning until 2 p.m. local time for the regions of Isabela and Quebradillas, located downstream of the Guajataca River.Emergency officials evacuated tens of thousands on Friday when it became apparent the dam could collapse under the weight of the additional water brought by Maria. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN late Sunday that the dam suffered infrastructure damage and is releasing water.""Right now, as it stands, a couple of hours after I went through Isabela, part of the dam did break [and] it is releasing water,"" Rosselló said. ""And that dam is partly concrete, partly soil. So as water runs through, erosion starts having its toll on the dam and my concern is at some point it'll break.""Ramón Rosario, the secretary of public affairs and public policy in Puerto Rico, said an American engineer was scheduled to visit the dam, according to Radio Isla 1320. In addition to the worries about the dam, the entire island, home to more than 3.4 million people, remains without power. It could be months before power is fully restored.The U.S. Department of Energy said power restoration efforts in critical areas have begun in Puerto Rico as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands.The agency is coordinating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and mutual aid crews from New York.There are currently over 10,000 federal staff members helping with recovery in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and more are on the way, according to FEMA.FEMA administrator Brock Long is expected to visit both Puerto Rico and the U,S. Virgin Islands on Monday. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, said Monday morning that he is calling for additional support to be sent to Puerto Rico to help with rescue and construction operations. As Maria tracked over the island, it unleashed rainfall totals of more than 20 inches (508 mm) in many areas, which helped trigger record flooding. Maria was the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico in 85 years, while Rosselló said the storm was the worst hurricane in a century for the island.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/fears-of-dam-failure-persist-in-puerto-rico-as-officials-work-to-restore-power-following-marias-wrath,Fox,Conservative

181,Puerto Rico dam on brink of collapse,"Yaron Steinbuch,, Joe Tacopino, Danika Fears",2017-09-25,"The Puerto Rico dam that was severely weakened by Hurricane Maria teetered on the brink of collapse Monday, as residents endured another day without power and dwindling food and water. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló warned of a “humanitarian crisis” if Congress doesn’t soon approve an aid package for the US territory. “We need something tangible, a bill that actually answers to our need right now,” he told CNN. A collapse of the earthen Guajataca Dam in the northwest part of the island could trigger a flood that would threaten the lives of tens of thousands of people. “Some of the dam has fallen apart,” Rosselló said. “Now we are making sure that we can assess if the other part will fall down, as well. It represents a great danger for about an estimated 70,000 people.” With 91 percent of cellphone sites out of service, authorities went door-to-door, warning people of the potential dam collapse. “My action has been to order evacuation,” the governor said. “I’d rather be wrong on that front than do nothing and having it fail and costing people their lives.” It’s been nearly a week since Hurricane Maria directly hit the island as a Category 4 storm, and residents were still struggling to access basic supplies such as clean drinking water and gas. “The devastation in Puerto Rico has set us back nearly 20 to 30 years,” Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez told CBS News. “The destruction of properties, of flattened structures, of families without homes, of debris everywhere. The island’s greenery is gone.” House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday pledged his support for the island, which is also in the midst of a $73 billion debt crisis. “The stories and images coming out of Puerto Rico are devastating,” he said. An aerial photo revealed a plea scrawled large letters on in the coastal town of Punta Santiago. “S.O.S. We need water/food!!” it read in Spanish. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released nighttime satellite images taken before and after the storm, with the later photo showing the powerless island in darkness. Puerto Rican officials have confirmed at least 10 storm-related deaths on the island, and Maria was blamed for at least 19 other fatalities across the Caribbean. Metro Puerto Rico columnist Armando Valdés described finding a “heartbreaking” situation at a 14-story nursing home for low-income people in San Juan. “Without food and an impossible climb down for most residents, some folks we spoke to couldn’t remember when they had last eaten,” he wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. “They had no drinking water. The ground-floor public restroom that was being used by many residents — it had some water being on the lowest level — was a putrid mess.” At the Puerto Rico Medical Center in San Juan, the island’s largest public hospital, an official said help was badly needed. “If this is not taken care of, people are going to start dying,” said Dr. Juan Carlos Sotomonte, a director of the cardiovascular unit. Hundreds of stranded travelers filled the stifling halls of San Juan Airport Monday, anxious to learn when they could leave. A nurse from Little Rock, Ark., told CBS News that they were in dire need of food, water and fans. “It’s inhumane,” she said. More celebs, meanwhile, were donating to relief efforts. Rapper Daddy Yankee said he gave $1 million to Feed America and another $1 million to the Red Cross. “I have my family there” he told CNN. “I have my wife, my daughter, and I live there still . . . and we really need your help.” With Wire Services ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/25/puerto-rico-dam-on-brink-of-collapse/,New York Post,Conservative
131,"$1B OK'd for Puerto Rico hurricane aid, but governor says he'll seek more",,2017-09-24,"Federal aid began pouring into Puerto Rico on Saturday, welcomed by local officials who praised the Trump administration's response to the devastating effects of hurricanes Irma and Maria.In northwest Puerto Rico, people began returning to their homes after a spillway eased pressure on a dam that cracked after more than a foot of rain fell in the wake of the hurricane.The opening of the island's main port in San Juan allowed 11 ships to bring in 1.6 million gallons of water, 23,000 cots, dozens of generators and food. Dozens more shipments are expected in upcoming days.The federal aid effort is racing to stem a growing humanitarian crisis in towns left without fresh water, fuel, electricity or phone service.Officials with FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is in charge of the relief effort, said they would take satellite phones to all of Puerto Rico's towns and cities, more than half of which were cut off following Maria's devastating crossing of Puerto Rico on Wednesday.The island's infrastructure was in sorry shape long before Maria struck. A $73 billion debt crisis has left agencies like the state power company broke. As a result the power company abandoned most basic maintenance in recent years, leaving the island subject to regular blackouts.A federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico's finances authorized up to $1 billion in local funds to be used for hurricane response, but Gov. Ricardo Rossello said he would ask for more.""We're going to request waivers and other mechanisms so Puerto Rico can respond to this crisis,"" he said. ""Puerto Rico will practically collect no taxes in the next month.""U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York said she will request a one-year waiver from the Jones Act, a federal law blamed for driving up prices on Puerto Rico by requiring cargo shipments there to move only on U.S. vessels as a means of supporting the U.S. maritime industry.""We will use all our resources,"" Velazquez said. ""We need to make Puerto Rico whole again. These are American citizens.""Meanwhile, a group of anxious mayors arrived in San Juan to meet with Rossello to present a long list of items they urgently need. The north coastal town of Manati had run out of fuel and fresh water, Mayor Jose Sanchez Gonzalez said.""Hysteria is starting to spread. The hospital is about to collapse. It's at capacity,"" he said, crying. ""We need someone to help us immediately.""POWERLESS PUERTO RICO'S STORM CRISIS DEEPENS WITH DAM THREATThe death toll from Maria in Puerto Rico was at least 10, including two police officers who drowned in floodwaters in the western town of Aguada. That number was expected to climb as officials from remote towns continued to check in with officials in San Juan.Authorities in the town of Vega Alta on the north coast said they had been unable to reach an entire neighborhood called Fatima, and were particularly worried about residents of a nursing home.""I need to get there today,"" Mayor Oscar Santiago told the Associated Press. ""Not tomorrow, today.""Rossello said Maria would clearly cost more than the last major storm to wallop the island, Hurricane George in September 1998. ""This is without a doubt the biggest catastrophe in modern history for Puerto Rico,"" he said.A dam upstream of the towns of Quebradillas and Isabela in northwest Puerto Rico was cracked but had not burst by Saturday afternoon as the water continued to pour out of rain-swollen Lake Guajataca. Federal officials said Friday that 70,000 people, the number who live in the surrounding area, would have to be evacuated. But Javier Jimenez, mayor of the nearby town of San Sebastian, said he believed the number was far smaller.Secretary of Public Affairs Ramon Rosario said about 300 families were in harm's way.The governor said there is ""significant damage"" to the dam and authorities believe it could give way at any moment. ""We don't know how long it's going to hold. The integrity of the structure has been compromised in a significant way,"" Rossello said.The 345-yard (316-meter) dam, which was built around 1928, holds back a man-made lake covering about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers). More than 15 inches (nearly 40 centimeters) of rain from Maria fell on the surrounding mountains, swelling the reservoir.Officials said 1,360 of the island's 1,600 cellphone towers were downed, and 85 percent of above-ground and underground phone and internet cables were knocked out. With roads blocked and phones dead, officials said, the situation may worsen.""We haven't seen the extent of the damage,"" Rossello told reporters in the capital. Rossello couldn't say when power might be restored.Maj. Gen. Derek P. Rydholm, deputy to the chief of the Air Force Reserve, said mobile communications systems were being flown in, but acknowledged ""it's going to take a while"" before people in Puerto Rico will be able to communicate with their families outside the island.The island's electric grid was in sorry shape long before Maria struck. The territory's $73 billion debt crisis has left agencies like the state power company broke. It abandoned most basic maintenance in recent years, leaving the island subject to regular blackouts.Rosello said he was distributing 250 satellite phones from FEMA to mayors across the island to re-establish contact.At least 31 lives in all have been lost around the Caribbean, including at least 15 on hard-hit Dominica. Haiti reported three deaths; Guadeloupe, two; and the Dominican Republic, one.Across Puerto Rico, more than 15,000 people are in shelters, including some 2,000 rescued from the north coastal town of Toa Baja.Some of the island's 3.4 million people planned to head to the U.S. to temporarily escape the devastation. At least in the short term, though, the soggy misery will continue: Additional rain — up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) — is expected through Saturday.In San Juan, Neida Febus wandered around her neighborhood with bowls of cooked rice, ground meat and avocado, offering food to the hungry. The damage was so extensive, the 64-year-old retiree said, that she didn't think the power would be turned back on until Christmas.""This storm crushed us from one end of the island to the other,"" she said.Hour-long lines formed at the few gas stations that reopened on Friday and anxious residents feared power could be out for weeks — or even months — and wondered how they would cope.""I'm from here. I believe we have to step up to the task. If everyone leaves, what are we going to do? With all the pros and the cons, I will stay here,"" Israel Molina, 68, who lost roofing from his San Juan mini-market to the storm, said, and then paused.

184,Mets’ personal plea to fans: Help us with Puerto Rico,Fred Kerber,2017-09-24,"Mets bullpen coach Ricky Bones and pitcher Seth Lugo made an appeal to fans to join in with the team’s support of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s hurricane relief and recovery effort for Puerto Rico. They, along with catcher Tomas Nido, “represent” Puerto Rico on the Mets. Bones, who has many family members in Puerto Rico, still has not heard from his father in the town of Guayama, which was “really destroyed” by Hurricane Maria. “I haven’t talked to my dad yet. It’s been tough, but I know he’s fine,” said a teary-eyed Bones, who received a call from one of his nieces after she managed to get to San Juan and call. Lugo also has family there – “They are in San Germain and I am fortunate my grandma got in contact with them this morning so they’re OK. It’s the first I heard from them.” The Mets ask fans attending games Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to bring donations to Citi Field collection points outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, Left Field Gate and Bullpen Gate. Donations will be accepted from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Additionally, on Thursday and Friday, the Mets will accept donations from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. outside the Robinson Rotunda. Fans driving to the game should enter Lot G on 126th St. and go to the fire lane in front of the Rotunda. Mets staff will help unload items. Requested donations, which must be unopened and packaged, are batteries, flashlights, portable lanterns, cases of bottled water, diapers, baby wipes, feminine hygiene products, plus canned and non-perishable food.  Mets manager Terry Collins was asked about Oakland’s Bruce Maxwell, who on Saturday became the first MLB player to kneel during the national anthem. “I’m not a big political guy,” Collins said, “not by the biggest stretch of the imagination. I’ve been blessed enough to travel the world and I respect our country immensely. We do have rights here which other places don’t. I respect that also, but I’m proud of my guys that they go line up every night and stand and face the flag. Everybody’s allowed to have their own thoughts and I’m not going to certainly criticize anybody, I don’t do that stuff, but I’m happy that our guys do what they do.” Washington’s Trea Turner hit the 195th home run of the season, the new single season record for Citi Field, in the third inning. Additionally, the Mets tied their franchise single season record when Brandon Nimmo homered in the first inning, his fifth and the team’s 218th of the season. That equaled last season’s mark and represented the first time the Mets have hit 200 homers in consecutive seasons.

185,Failing dam creates new crisis in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico,Eileen AJ Connelly,2017-09-23,"Water was still spewing through the spillway of the cracked Guajataca Dam in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Saturday — but by nightfall officials had dramatically backed off their earlier estimates that up to 70,000 people were threatened in towns downstream. Only a handful of neighborhoods in two towns abutting the Guajataca River must evacuate — just 350 people, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. Still, “We don’t know how long it’s going to hold,” Rossello said of the dam. “The integrity of the structure has been compromised in a significant way,” he said, noting, “It could break at any moment.” Video shot from a helicopter showed a heavy stream of water pouring from the spillway of the 345-yard dam, which holds back manmade Guajataca Lake in the northwestern part of the island. Water was also visibly leaking from beneath the dam’s main berm. The 2-mile-square lake provides drinking water, and the dam is a source of hydroelectric power. El Nuevo Dia, Puerto Rico’s biggest newspaper, reported that authorities found the water leaks were easing pressure on the 88-year-old structure. El Nuevo Dia reported that about 320 people threatened by a dam collapse had been removed. Javier Jimenez, mayor of the town of San Sebastian, told The Associated Press that he believed the actual number of evacuees was far smaller than the official number, and that only several hundred families were told to leave the banks of the Guajataca River. San Sebastian is west of the dam and outside the worst flood zone. All of Puerto Rico remained without power following Wednesday’s devastating blow from Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm with winds up to 155 mph that dumped more than 15 inches of rain. Ten people were reported killed by the storm in Puerto Rico — a toll expected to climb as word comes in from remote towns. Officials lost communication with more than half the island’s towns. Some 1,360 of the island’s 1,600 cellphone towers were downed, and 85 percent of above-ground and underground phone and Internet cables were knocked out by the storm, the most powerful to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century. Roads remained blocked, bridges were collapsed or washed away, and floodwaters inundated thousands of homes. Fresh water and fuel supplies were dwindling. Gas-station lines were hours long. “Hysteria is starting to spread,” said José Sanchez Gonzalez, mayor of the north coastal town of Manati. “The hospital is about to collapse. It’s at capacity,” he said, crying. “We need someone to help us immediately.” The storm caused an estimated $30 billion in damage and lost economic activity in debt-burdened Puerto Rico, which declared bankruptcy in May. “This is without a doubt the biggest catastrophe in modern history for Puerto Rico,” Rossello said.

188,Death toll from Maria rises in Puerto Rico,"Kirstan Conley, Yaron Steinbuch",2017-09-22,"The death toll from Hurricane Maria jumped to at least 13 in Puerto Rico, where almost 700 people were rescued from rising floodwaters, officials said Friday. Among the victims were eight people who drowned in Toa Baja, about 20 miles west of San Juan, according to Mayor Bernardo Márquez, Reuters reported. Three elderly sisters were killed by a mudslide in the mountainous central municipality of Utuado, the newspaper El Nuevo Día reported, citing relatives and the mayor of Utuado. Gov. Ricardo Rossello called Maria the most devastating storm in a century after it obliterated the US territory’s electricity and telecommunications infrastructure. “Part of the island is lacking communications, so what we have are some preliminary assessments about 13 deaths at this juncture,” he told CNN early Friday. El Nuevo Día‏ reported at least 15 people were killed, according to Reuters. “We’re 24 hours post-hurricane warning and right now our efforts are to make sure we have everybody safe, that we can rescue people. Our efforts have already produced almost 700 rescues so we’re clearly focused on that,” Rossello said. Meanwhile, New York politicians unable to contact family members embarked for the devastated island Friday, accompanied by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The lawmakers included worried Bronx Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, who said he has not been able to reach his mother for four days. “Today’s Mommy’s birthday,” Crespo said. US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a Brooklyn Democrat, struggled to keep her composure as she prepared to board a flight, arranged by JetBlue. “For me this is personal,” she said. “I have not been able to talk to my family yet.” Cuomo and the team brought 36,000 bottles of water, 10,000 ready-to-eat meals, blankets, pillows and flashlights, in addition to large power generators, which will be used for hospitals and communications facilities. The pols will be joined by energy experts, who will spend the day assessing the island’s greatest needs. Members of the New York National Guard and Black Hawk helicopters will also be landing on the US territory soon. The National Hurricane Center said some areas in Puerto Rico could see 40 inches of rain from Maria, and Rossello warned of dangerous mudslides. “We have a lot of flooding, we have reports of complete devastation of vulnerable housing. Of course it’s still raining over here,” he said. Maria was blamed for at least 33 deaths, including 15 in Dominica, three in Haiti, two in Guadeloupe and one in the US Virgin Islands, according to reports. Ricardo Ramos, who heads Puerto Rico’s electricity board, said it could take months before power is fully restored across the island. “The system … has been totally destroyed,” he said of the power grid. Utility crews from the US mainland headed to Puerto Rico to help restore the grid. The US military also sent ground forces and aircraft to assist with search and rescue. While the island had suffered major blackouts in previous hurricanes, Ramos said the impact would be felt much more strongly this time. “I guess it’s a good time for dads to buy a glove and ball and change the way you entertain your children and the way you are going to go to school and the way you are going to cook,” Ramos told CNN. Amid reports of looting, Rossello imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. for the island’s 3.4 million people that will stay in effect until Saturday.

187,Cuomo back after seeing ‘heartbreaking’ devastation in Puerto Rico,Nick Fugallo,2017-09-22,"Gov. Cuomo saw Hurricane Maria’s devastation up close Puerto Rico on Friday, calling it “heartbreaking” and “much worse than appears on TV.” The governor, who distributed supplies during his day-long trip, urged Americans to open their hearts and wallets to Puerto Rican relief efforts. “It’s much worse than appears on TV, “ Cuomo told reporters at JFK on Friday night, moments after his return to the continental US. “The devastation of the island is heartbreaking. There are parts of the island that are covered in eight feet of water.” Assemblyman Marcos Crespo (D-Bronx), who traveled with the governor, said he still hasn’t been able to reach loved ones in Puerto Rico – including his mom. The town where Crespo’s mom lives is so battered and flooded, there was no way for the governor’s traveling party to get there, a Cuomo rep said. “While I didn’t get to see mommy, I have hope,” Crespo said. “I don’t know much about my town today, as I did before this trip. But I know the donations Puerto Ricans received are going to help where it matters most.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/22/cuomo-back-after-seeing-heartbreaking-devastation-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
186,Carmelo Anthony wants to raise $1 million for Puerto Rico,Corey Masisak,2017-09-22,"Carmelo Anthony desperately wants to help hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, and he’d like you to help him do that. Anthony, whose father was from Puerto Rico, started a YouCaring donation page Friday to help people whose island has been ravaged by Hurricane Maria. “The entire island is dark. But even if we can’t hear it, there’s more than 3 million people down there calling out for help,” Anthony wrote for The Players’ Tribune. “Imagine your house being powerless for just one hour. Just one day. Just one week. Imagine the young kids you have in your life — your son, your daughter, your nephew, your granddaughter — imagine them being scared and hungry for just one day. “Puerto Ricans are facing the possibility of six months of that kind of struggle. I think about my own family in that situation and I can’t even wrap my mind around it. I can’t grasp it. I know there’s so many different things going on in America and in the world right now that need our attention, but damn … I need your help. I need the help of anybody reading this. We have to help the people of Puerto Rico get the supplies they need to survive day-to-day until their country can be built up again.” Anthony pledged $50,000 to start, and has set a goal of $1 million. The crowdfunding page had raised more than $100,000 by the middle of Friday afternoon. After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston and the surrounding area, Texas star J.J. Watt started with a goal of raising $500,000. He ended up raising more than $37 million. Former Yankees star Jorge Posada has also started a YouCaring donation page to help the victims of his native country. Puerto Rico was still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma when Maria became the first Category 4 storm to directly hit the island since 1932. The entire island lost power and could be without it for 4-6 months. Anthony’s father died when he was two years old, but the Knicks star has long been an advocate for the Puerto Rican people. He has done charitable work on the island for years, and is the owner of Puerto Rico FC, a team in the North American Soccer League. “I know to a lot of people reading the news, it’s just a headline. It’s just another disaster. But man, if you’ve ever been to Puerto Rico, you already know the spirit of the people,” Anthony wrote. “The joy of those kids. The energy and good vibes you feel the minute you step on the island. “Right now, I literally don’t know what’s happening down there, or if my people are OK, or what the future holds. I know that it’s not gonna be easy. I’m just asking for your help.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/22/carmelo-anthony-wants-to-raise-1-million-for-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative

As of Maria's arrival, more than 70,000 residents still had no electricity.Felix Delgado, mayor of the northern coastal town of Catano, said 80 percent of the 454 homes in his neighborhood were destroyed.Delgado said it'll take ""months and months and months and months"" for Puerto Rico to recover from the devastating storm.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello urged people to have faith: ""We are stronger than any hurricane. Together, we will rebuild."" He later asked President Donald Trump to declare the island a disaster zone, a step that would open the way to federal aid.More than 11,000 people were in shelters, Rossello said.In San Juan, Maria's fierce winds toppled trees and ripped away outside materials of high-rise buildings in the city, while people calling local radio stations reported that doors were flying off hinges and a water tank flew away in the island's southern region.Widespread flooding was reported across the island, with dozens of cars half-submerged in some neighborhoods and many streets turned into rivers.Those who sought shelter at a coliseum in San Juan were moved to the building's second and third floors, reported radio station WKAQ 580 AM.The storm also spawned torrential rainfall across the island, leading to flash flood emergency warnings.Videos posted to Twitter showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of Guayama on the island's southern coast and other locations.Many feared extended power outages on the island would further sink businesses struggling amid a recession that has lasted more than a decade.""This is going to be a disaster,"" Jean Robert Auguste, who owns two French restaurants and sought shelter at a San Juan hotel, told the Associated Press.

""It is also the 10th-most-intense hurricane in Atlantic Basin history, based on minimum central pressure.""The storm's center passed near St. Croix overnight Tuesday, prompting U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp to insist that people remain alert. St. Croix was largely spared the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Irma on the chain's St. Thomas and St. John islands just two weeks ago. But this time, the island would experience five hours of hurricane force winds, Mapp said.""For folks in their homes, I really recommend that you not be in any kind of sleepwear,"" he said during a brief news conference. ""Make sure you have your shoes on. Make sure you have a jacket around. Something for your head in case your roof should breach. ...

""The Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard is also preparing to send a supply vessel and to take Defense Force personnel as well as supplies up to Dominica.”Officials in Guadeloupe said the French island near Dominica probably would experience heavy flooding and warned many communities could be submerged. In nearby Martinique, authorities ordered people to remain indoors and said they should be prepared for power outages and disruption in the water supply.Guadeloupe prefect Eric Maire said up to 16 inches of rain was forecast in some parts of the island, and storm surge could also flood low-lying coastal areas.""We've already got some early information of flooding, flooded houses and submerged roads,"" Maire said in a video posted to Twitter. Officials said one person was killed in Guadeloupe after they were hit by a falling tree. Two additional people were reported missing after their ship sank off Desirade, the easternmost island in the French territory's archipelago.At least 80,000 households in Guadeloupe and at least 70,000 households in Martinique are without power, France's Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said Tuesday.St. Thomas and St. John are still recovering from a direct hit by Hurricane Irma, which did extensive damage and caused four deaths on the two islands. Barry University said it chartered a private plane to carry students and staff from its St. Croix facility to Florida in preparation for Maria. It said 72 people connected to Barry's physician assistant program and a few pets were on Monday's evacuation flight.On the British Virgin Islands, the local government issued a curfew in advance of the storm, Sky News reported.""While Hurricane Maria may not be as strong as Hurricane Irma, our present reality is also very different,"" Orlando Smith, the premier of the self-governing British territory, said in a statement.

191,Hurricane Maria devastates Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-20,"Hurricane Maria was punishing Puerto Rico on Wednesday — uprooting trees, unleashing massive flooding and even breaking two National Weather Service radars on the island. “This is total devastation,” Carlos Mercader, a spokesman for Puerto Rico’s governor, told CNN. “Puerto Rico, in terms of the infrastructure, will not be the same. … This is something of historic proportions.” Gov. Ricardo Rossello warned of heavy rains and flooding but urged people to have faith. “We are stronger than any hurricane. Together, we will rebuild,” he said. So far, Maria has dumped 20 inches of rain across the island. The El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported that an emergency medical station in the northern town of Arecibo lost its roof, and communication was severed with several emergency management stations. People calling local radio stations reported that doors were flying off hinges and a water tank flew away in the island’s southern region. “There is debris flying through the air, there are bins … we’ve seen trees broken off, and balconies broken off and these are substantial buildings,” Sky News reporter Mark Austin said. Asked if the island had been evacuated, Austin said there were still many people inside their homes. “I’ve got to tell you that many of the homes in Puerto Rico just will not stand this,” he said. “The other problem here is that they’ve just been through Hurricane Irma so there is already serious damage. Puerto Rico is also going through the most terrible of economic times … a decade of recession. They really don’t need this, as well.” Rosita Galguerra, 66, who was riding out the storm with her husband in the Rio Piedras neighborhood of San Juan, described what she was seeing as “incredible.” “The rain is horizontal and all the trees are on the ground,” she told the Miami Herald. “The house is trembling — and my house is made of concrete with a concrete roof. The winds are like out of a horror movie and it’s gusts, gusts, gusts. The island is going to be completely destroyed.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/20/hurricane-maria-pummels-puerto-rico-with-total-devastation/,New York Post,Conservative
192,Hurricane Maria makes landfall in Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-20,"Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico early Wednesday as a “potentially catastrophic” Category 4 storm that was set to become the most powerful to strike the US territory in almost 90 years. Thousands of Puerto Ricans hunkered down in shelters as Maria — packing sustained winds of 155 mph — made landfall near Yabucoa, according to the US National Hurricane Center. Gov. Ricardo Rossello — who warned residents to brace for the “the worst storm of the last century” — tweeted that more than 11,000 people had sought refuge in about 500 shelters with 200 pets in tow. Conditions were expected to deteriorate between 8 and 9 a.m. Wednesday when the eye wall hits the eastern coast of the island, CNN reported. “I’m not denying I’m scared,” said Noemi Aviles Rivera, a 47-year-old schoolteacher who experienced Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Georges in 1998. “I feel worried because it’s the first time I’ll see a hurricane of this magnitude.” Zinc roofs flew and windows broke as the storm bore down, with almost 900,000 people left without power and one tree falling on an ambulance. Those who sought shelter at a coliseum in San Juan were moved to the building’s second and third floors, reported radio station WKAQ 580 AM. Maria is expected to dump as much as 25 inches of rain on parts of the island and bring storm surges of up to 9 feet, the NHC said. Officials feared that the heavy rain could unleash life-threatening mudslides. The island of about 3.4 million people avoided a direct hit from Hurricane Irma, but the storm knocked out power for 70 percent of the territory and killed at least three people. Maria was set to be the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, when the San Felipe Segundo hurricane killed about 300 people, according to the National Weather Service. The last Category 4 hurricane landfall in Puerto Rico occurred in 1932. “This is going to be catastrophic for our island,” Grisele Cruz, who was staying at a shelter in the southeastern city of Guayama, told Reuters. “We’re going to be without services for a long time.” More than 150 flights were canceled at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, the main international airport in Puerto Rico, on Wednesday morning, according to tracking service FlightAware.com. As Maria approached, President Trump offered his support via Twitter. “Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane. Be careful, our hearts are with you- will be there to help!” he said. Later Wednesday and into Thursday, Maria will pass just north of the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic, the NHC said. It was too early to know if the storm will threaten the continental US as it churns northward in the Atlantic. A few hours earlier, Maria passed west of St. Croix, home to about half of the US Virgin Islands’ 103,000 residents, as a Category 5 storm. Authorities expected to start assessing storm damage on St. Croix at daybreak. On Monday, the storm plowed into Dominica, a mountainous country of 72,000 people, causing what Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit called “mind-boggling” destruction. North of Dominica, the French island territory of Guadeloupe also was hit hard. Authorities told Reuters that one person was killed by a falling tree and at least two people were missing in a shipwreck. Maria ties for the eighth-strongest storm in Atlantic history, when measured by wind speed. Coming in second is Irma, which had 185-mph winds and killed 38 people in the Caribbean and another 36 in the US earlier this month.

193,Puerto Rico warns ‘evacuate or die’ as Maria approaches,Danika Fears,2017-09-19,"Hurricane Maria left a trail of “widespread destruction” on the small island of Dominica on Tuesday, then took aim at the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as a potentially catastrophic ­Category 5 storm. With 165-mph winds, the monster hurricane churned northwest, battering Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands with heavy rain and powerful gusts as residents of St. Croix waited for the storm’s eye to pass “near or over” the island overnight. In Puerto Rico — which was largely spared the worst of Hurricane Irma’s wrath earlier this month — officials prepared for an outright calamity, urging residents to seek shelter before the storm makes landfall Wednesday. “You have to evacuate. Otherwise, you’re going to die,” warned Hector Pesquera, the island’s public safety commissioner. “I don’t know how to make this any clearer.” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said the US territory would “have to rebuild.” “This is going to impact all of Puerto Rico with a force and violence that we haven’t seen for several generations,” he said. “We’re going to lose a lot of infrastructure.” Before hitting Puerto Rico, Maria was supposed to lash the US Virgin Islands, creating waves of up to 25 feet on St. Croix. “This is an extremely, extremely dangerous hurricane,” USVI Gov. Kenneth Mapp warned Tuesday, adding that the area would see storm surges of 6 to 9 feet and up to 20 inches of rain. Calling the hurricane a “live animal,” Mapp told residents to remain on high alert because Maria’s course could quickly change. Maria caused at least one death on the French island of Guadeloupe, where 80,000 households were left without power Tuesday after the storm swept through. One hurricane victim on the island hadn’t heeded orders to stay inside Tuesday, and was killed by a falling tree. Two other people went missing after their boat sank. Dominica Consul General Barbara Dailey said officials hadn’t been able to communicate with anyone on the island since 4 a.m. Tuesday. The roofs of 70 percent of the island’s homes had been torn off, according to authorities. “So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace,” Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit wrote in his last Facebook dispatch before the country lost phone and internet connections. “My greatest fear . . . is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains.” With wires ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/19/puerto-rico-warns-evacuate-or-die-as-maria-approaches/,New York Post,Conservative
194,Puerto Rico braces for catastrophic Hurricane Maria,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-19,"Hurricane Maria churned toward the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday, after unleashing “widespread devastation” on the small island of Dominica as a Category 5 storm. Maria’s power diminished slightly to Category 4 after slamming Dominica on Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center. But after an Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” plane flew into the storm, Maria regained its Category 5 status, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 160 mph as it stirred about 205 miles southeast of St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, the center said. If the storm — which ripped through the former French and British colony with catastrophic winds — retains its strength, it would be the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1932, when a Category 4 storm swept the US island territory, according to Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. Early Tuesday, it was moving west-northwest at 9 mph, with that track expected to continue through Wednesday. “On the forecast track, the eye of Maria will move over the northeastern Caribbean Sea today, and approach the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight and Wednesday,” according to the NHC. It was expected to be “an extremely dangerous Category 4 or 5 hurricane” as it bears down on the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 30 miles outward from the center of the storm, and tropical storm-force winds extended up to 125 miles from the center, the NHC said. A hurricane warning remains in effect for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, the US and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Culebra and Vieques. The regional government of Guadeloupe tweeted early Tuesday to its residents: “Don’t go out under any circumstances.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, has declared a state of emergency ahead of Maria’s expected arrival Wednesday. President Trump has issued an emergency declaration to allow federal assistance for Puerto Rico, which sheltered many of the evacuees from other Caribbean islands who fled Hurricane Irma. Rosselló has ordered evacuations while officials prepared for the storm. “We’re as ready as we can be,” he told CNN. “This sort of event is a very dangerous event, high winds … and a lot of rainfall. And this coming just about two weeks after Irma skirted off the northeast of Puerto Rico. “We’ve made preparations … we’ve focused on really the only thing that matters right now, which is making sure people are safe. We have 500 shelters, (we’re) moving people to those shelters and hopefully weathering the storm so we can rebuild Puerto Rico.” The last major hurricane to strike Puerto Rico directly was Georges, which made landfall there as a Category 3 storm in 1998. On Dominica, where Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit captured the fury of Maria on Facebook, officials were waiting for daylight to assess the damage to the island nation of more than 73,000 people. “The winds are merciless! We shall survive by the grace of God,” Skerrit wrote at the start of several increasingly chilling posts on Facebook. “Initial reports are of widespread devastation,” he wrote. “So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace. My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains.” With Post wires ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/19/puerto-rico-braces-for-catastrophic-hurricane-maria/,New York Post,Conservative

197,Hurricane Irma leaves deadly wake in Puerto Rico,Yaron Steinbuch,2017-09-07,"Three deaths have been reported in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Irma, which swept by the US territory on its path toward Florida. A woman in the northern municipality of Camuy died of electrocution, a woman in nearby Manati died in a fall en route to a shelter and a man was killed while driving in Canóvanas, officials said. Meanwhile, more than 1 million people remained without power on the island. The Puerto Rico Department of Health reported that 42 percent of hospitals are using generators due to the electricity problems. “It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,” Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Thursday. Although the National Hurricane Center canceled the hurricane warning, Rosselló said rain was still expected to fall and add to widespread flooding. Five additional inches were expected across Puerto Rico, increasing the dangers of landslides, he said. In the capital of San Juan, waves of up to 30 feet were reported at the height of the storm. Local police said there are a total of 6,298 people and 501 pets in shelters. Rosselló added that ports on the island remain closed, and it was unclear when commercial flights will resume. Schools and government offices are scheduled to reopen Monday. The governor said he had spoken with President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House chief of staff John Kelly, all of whom expressed their solidarity and support. In a Thursday morning tweet, Trump said Irma “is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help.” Trump asked people to “be careful, be safe!” Despite the damage, Puerto Rico’s population of about 3.4 million people has largely been spared the devastation wrought by Irma in other Caribbean islands. “Though this event was strong, it certainly could have had a greater impact,” Rosselló said at a news conference.

199,Hurricane Irma slams Puerto Rico,Max Jaeger,2017-09-06,"Hurricane Irma was already hammering Puerto Rico on Wednesday afternoon, even as its powerful eye was still 90 miles east over the Virgin Islands. Nearly 300,000 people had already lost power and some 4,000 had no water, according to reports. The director of Puerto Rico’s public power company warned that some areas could be without power for four to six months because the infrastructure has already deteriorated so badly as a result of ongoing budget cuts on the financially strapped US commonwealth. “The dangerousness of this event is like nothing we’ve ever seen,” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. “A lot of infrastructure won’t be able to withstand this kind of force.” The National Weather Service tweeted that the capital, San Juan, should brace for winds up to 80 mph as the storm, which is packing maximum sustained winds up to 185 mph, barrels west toward the island at about 16 mph. The storm slammed Barbuda when it made landfall there at 1:47 a.m. and is expected to pass about 30 miles north of San Juan between 6 and 8 p.m., according to Rosello’s office. Irma’s “life-threatening” surge is expected to rise up to six feet above ground level on Puerto Rico’s northern coast and up to four feet above ground level on the southern side of the island, according to the National Weather Service.

198,Delta flight races Hurricane Irma to Puerto Rico — and wins,Chris Perez,2017-09-06,"Eat your heart out, United! A Delta flight that was heading to Puerto Rico from JFK Airport on Wednesday managed to outrun Hurricane Irma — flying directly into the path of the Category 5 storm as it was bearing down on the island — before landing and taking off within the span of an hour. The Boeing 737 was reportedly full of passengers after leaving the Big Apple at 8:12 a.m., according to FlightAware. The online tracking system showed Flight 431 arriving in San Juan at 12:01 p.m. — just as Irma was making landfall. Images posted on Twitter depicted a surreal scene, with the plane appearing to fly straight into the arms of the hurricane. “Where others have turned back, Delta #DL431 presses on,” tweeted Flightradar24, an account that tracks live air traffic. With no time to spare, the pilots quickly took care of business on the ground and got the plane back in the air by 12:41 p.m., FlightAware reported. The flight later returned home to New York with its 173 passengers at 4:22 p.m. Jason Rabinowitz, a self-described aviation geek, was one of countless people who tweeted the flight’s trajectory in real time Wednesday. Several pictures that he posted showed the plane ascending from San Juan’s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport — flying between the “outer band” of Irma and the “core” of the storm. “Amazing stuff,” Rabinowitz said. He added that a number of flights had attempted to “squeak” into San Juan before air traffic control ceased operations, but only Flight 431 was able to make it in time. “This Delta flight was the last both in and out of SJU,” Rabinowitz said. While the move appeared gutsy, Delta officials later downplayed the incident — saying its staff was “armed with the latest forecast from the airline’s meteorology team.” “Our meteorology team is the best in the business,” explained Erik Snell, vice president for Delta operations and customer center. “They took a hard look at the weather data and the track of the storm and worked with the flight crew and dispatcher to agree it was safe to operate the flight,” he said. “And our flight and ground crews were incredible in their effort to turn the aircraft quickly and safely so the flight could depart well before the hurricane threat.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/09/06/delta-flight-races-hurricane-irma-to-puerto-rico-and-wins/,New York Post,Conservative
200,"Florida, Puerto Rico declare states of emergency as Irma strengthens",Emily Saul,2017-09-04,"Hurricane Irma strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm on Monday, prompting both Florida and Puerto Rico to declare states of emergency as they brace for a potential direct impact. Winds topped 130 mph as Irma swirled in the Atlantic — and “a landfall in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas is all in the realm of possibilities,’’ said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Evan Myers. “This hurricane has the potential to be a major event for the East Coast,” he said. “It also has the potential to significantly strain FEMA and other governmental resources occurring so quickly on the heels of Harvey.” Puerto Rico was first to declare a state of emergency Monday, as the National Hurricane Center forecast that the storm would strike the US territory Wednesday. Florida followed suit a short time later. A hurricane watch was in effect for the British and US Virgin Islands, with Irma expected to arrive in their vicinity mid-week. And a string of the Leeward Islands — Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Monserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten and St. Barts — were issued hurricane warnings, which advise officials to rush storm preparations. The hurricane center also advised the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas to monitor the progress of Irma. It predicted that the eye of the storm would pass over or near the Leeward Islands by Tuesday with a potential to cause “life-threatening surf and rip current condition.” Irma was on course to head north toward the US mainland, potentially making landfall either next weekend or sometime early next week, meteorologists predict. Relief agencies still scrambling in the wake of Hurricane Harvey were bracing for the additional strain of yet another disaster. Officials say resources would be shifted, depending on Irma’s path. Harvey is so far believed to have claimed some 60 lives since hitting Texas and Louisiana and caused up to $180 billion in damage. “We put a hold on sending volunteers from the Mid-Atlantic states” to Texas in case Irma strikes the US mainland, Red Cross Regional Executive Officer Barry Porter told CBS affiliate WNCN-TV. “There [are] still a lot of other states to send volunteers from, but because of this pending threat, we’ve asked those volunteers to hold, update their records and help us here in the Carolinas if we need them. “With this East Coast threat of Irma coming late this week, we’re really concerned,” Porter said. Were Irma to hit the East Coast as a Category 4 or 5 storm, experts noted it would be a historic event. “The US has not sustained a direct hit from two Category 4 or above hurricanes in more than 100 years,” Myers said.

201,Woman’s heroic crusade to save dogs left for dead in Puerto Rico,Jennifer Gould,2017-08-21,"It’s as awful as the name implies. On a stretch of shoreline in Puerto Rico, heartbreakingly dubbed Dead Dog Beach, live pups are abandoned in the dunes by careless or impoverished owners. Some are tossed from moving cars like unwanted trash. Many arrive frail and emaciated, with pellet wounds lodged in their backs. Others are missing legs or ears, covered in mange and fleas. New Yorker Christina Beckles discovered the beach of horrors 10 years ago — and has been working tirelessly to save the slum dogs of the bankrupt island ever since. “At first, I could only rescue one dog at a time — and the feeling of leaving all of the others behind was terrible,” Beckles recently told The Post. Once a beautiful beach with a pool and changing rooms, the area was abandoned by the government and left littered with garbage as the island plunged into economic disaster. “There were so many dogs running in packs, it was very overwhelming,” Beckles said. “Everywhere you looked, there were dogs in terrible conditions, in the blazing sun all day, with no proper nutrition or fresh water. “Many of the dogs were gravely injured. There were dogs who had been hit by cars. There were a slew of dogs missing their back right hind legs. “It was overwhelming, the sense of what I felt, but it ignited a fire within me,’’ Beckles said. “I couldn’t sit back and do nothing. I had to help the dogs.” Beckles first flew to the island in 2007 to visit her husband, who was then working as a stuntman on a Benicio del Toro movie. At the time, she was training as a Golden Gloves champion boxer at famed Gleason’s Gym in Dumbo, Brooklyn. But once Beckles saw Dead Dog Beach, which is also known as Sato Beach, she couldn’t stop thinking about the poor creatures. She returned to Puerto Rico to volunteer for groups like Hands for Paws and soon quit her lucrative job as a marketing executive to launch her own nonprofit, The Sato Project, in 2011 so she could dedicate herself to rescuing Puerto Rico’s abandoned dogs full-time. (“Sato” is local slang for street or slum dog.) Beckles set up an office for the group at Gleason’s Gym. Their motto? “We fight so the dogs of Puerto Rico don’t have to.’’ In the past ten years, Beckles has helped rescue more than 1,800 dogs, as well as launch educational programs in Puerto Rico. At the same time, a new municipal government is working to revive the beach while revitalizing its port. Many of the abused dogs from the beach have been placed with families. And now, The Sato Project is working on its most ambitious project to date to try to rescue the rest. On Aug. 23, Beckles’ group, together with Wings of Rescue and the Humane Society of the United States, will fly 200 dogs rescued from the island to the United States, where they will be adopted. It’s the largest transport ever of dogs from Puerto Rico, according to Beckles, who has dubbed the transport Mission Possible 8. There are currently only nine animal shelters on the island, and more than 90 percent of the dogs who end up in the shelters are euthanized. “The shelters don’t receive government help, and yet they have to receive the dogs with minimal staff and resources. They are completely overwhelmed. It’s heartbreaking,” Beckles said. “The shelters are doing their best, but there is just nowhere to place the dogs and not enough resources to care for them.” The dogs will fly out on two private cargo planes. One will land in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., while the other will end up in Raleigh, NC. A team of professional stuntmen and riggers — led by Christina’s husband, Bobby Beckles — will load the pooches in Puerto Rico and ensure that they are safely secured for flight. When the planes land, the dogs will be met by the Humane Society and vets, who will check the pups out and put them on vehicles for transport up the East Coast. There will be stops from Washington, DC, to Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. In New York City, the dogs will go to Animal Haven and the Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons. The Sato Project also will keep 31 dogs that will be adopted directly or go into its own foster network in New York. Many of the 200 soon-to-be rescued dogs are older. Beckles says the mission is in memory of her own dog, Boom Boom, an Australian shepherd and Jack Russell “sato” mix that Beckles adopted in 2008. Beckles was devastated when Boom Boom died in 2016. “We rescued Boom Boom from a shelter. She [had been] left with her mother and four siblings,’’ Beckles recalled. “She was the only one who made it out alive. She was the impetus for our organization.” ON average, the cost to rescue a dog is between $1,000 and $1,500, according to Beckles. In addition to raising money for rescues, The Sato Project runs the educational programs and hands out vouchers to help locals pay for the costs associated with owning a dog. In Puerto Rico, residents often would run over dogs if they didn’t get out of a driver’s way fast enough, Beckles said. Children who grew up watching their parents’ animal cruelty continued it. “Education begins with the young,” Beckles said. The Sato Project also teaches Puerto Rican residents about neutering their dogs, which is something that was shunned by the island’s “machismo” culture, she said. “Locals are learning that neutering dogs doesn’t take away their manhood and it is helpful because it can curb behavioral and medical issues.” Today, Dead Dog Beach is “unrecognizable — and that’s because of us,” Beckles said. A new mayor has removed some crumbling warehouses, and there is even construction going on to build an atrium for public events. “There’s plans to bring in food vendors and a fishing association to sell fresh fish and revitalize the port,” Beckles said. “There isn’t a lot of garbage now, the way there once was.’’ She has also petitioned the local administration to place gates on the beach to stop cars from dumping dogs at night. So far, local authorities have put up one gate. She says the beach needs two. “You can walk on that beach today and [sometimes] not see a single dog,” Beckles said. “Because of the work we do, the numbers have decreased dramatically, and that enabled us to work in other areas on the island,” Beckles said. “We’re finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/08/21/womans-heroic-crusade-to-save-dogs-left-for-dead-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
202,Man ‘too injured to work’ busted kayaking in Puerto Rico,Kirstan Conley,2017-08-07,"An upstate psych center employee was caught kayaking in Puerto Rico while claiming he was too injured to work, State Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said Monday. Ryan Haley, 30, of Rome, applied for Workers’ Compensation benefits twice in 2016, reporting a back injury. Haley received $2,286.05 in April, while he was on a kayaking vacation, officials said. Haley signed a medical release for the kayak excursion certifying that he was physically fit and had no injuries, Leahy Scott said. “This defendant is accused of a contemptuous fraud in which he feigns being too injured to work while paddling a kayak on a Caribbean retreat,” she said. “Moreover, with utter disregard for the critical responsibilities of his job, he allegedly attacked one of the very patients for whom he was meant to care.” The security assistant at the Central New York Psychiatric Center in Marcy received another $407.80 in February, when he was caught in living it up California, officials said. Investigators found that he planned and paid for both trips before claiming funds for alleged on-the-job injuries. After the vacations, on May 28, Haley returned to work and tackled a patient to the ground, according to Leahy-Scott. He was arrested and charged with grand larceny, falsifying business records, insurance fraud, workers’ comp fraud and endangering the welfare of a disabled person, all felonies. Haley did not respond to messages seeking comment. ",https://nypost.com/2017/08/07/man-too-injured-to-work-busted-kayaking-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
134,Cal Thomas: Puerto Rico's sorry state,Cal Thomas,2017-06-22,"“Puerto Rico, my heart’s devotion. Let it sink back in the ocean.” — West Side StoryThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is drowning. The island, so popular with tourists, is $123 billion in debt. That’s more debt than the $18 billion bankruptcy filed by the city of Detroit in 2013. In May, San Juan declared a form of bankruptcy after creditors filed lawsuits demanding their money. A federal district judge appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts will handle the case.How did this happen? Luis Fortuno, former governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, who served as president of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico (PNP), which advocates for the island to become a U.S. state, believes he knows.Fortuno was elected in 2009. In a telephone interview from his Washington law office, he tells me that during his one term he cut government expenses by $2 billion and the island’s bond rating went up. “We refinanced the debt on better terms” and by the time he left office in 2013, “we had brought down the budget every year and lowered corporate taxes. People believed they could take risks again.”In the 2012 election, Fortuno lost to Democrat Alejandro Garcia Padilla by a narrow (0.6 percent) margin. Fortuno blames the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) for contributing to his opponent’s campaign. “They invested heavily against me,” he says. Padilla renewed the spending policies of the past and, though he left office earlier this year, the damage was done.According to the American Bankruptcy Institute Journal, most of Fortuno’s cuts in public expenditures were never implemented. The island’s Office of Management and Budget reported that one year following legislation that called for spending reductions, 31 government agencies had, instead, increased spending.As the Journal noted, under Fortuno “Puerto Rico implemented tax reform and permit reform, legislated a world-leading public-private partnership (P3) act, reduced government expenses and paid its suppliers…”In light of such success, why would voters return control of the island to a party that was responsible for its fiscal downturn? Sometimes ideology beats success and common sense. Fortuno says it didn’t help that “61 percent of eligible voters failed to vote.”A referendum on the status of Puerto Rico was held in Puerto Rico on June 11. Three options were open to voters: remain with the commonwealth, independence or statehood. Statehood won.Would a Republican Congress and a Republican president ever back statehood for a territory that seems overwhelmingly Democratic and possibly add two senators and one voting House member to that party’s total in Washington?Fortuno doesn’t believe it is a given that Democrats would win those seats. He draws a distinction between the mostly liberal Puerto Ricans who have left the island for places like New York City and those who remain. He says current residents “are social and economic conservatives,” suggesting Republicans could pick up seats.Perhaps, but the U.S. taxpayer would also have to pick up Puerto Rico’s huge debt and with our debt at $20 trillion, it is doubtful Congress, at least under a Republican majority, would be willing to add more red ink.Perhaps those economic and social conservatives Fortuno says remain on the island might come to their senses and elect someone who represents his views, which were beginning to bear fruit, before a bare majority panicked and returned to the failed policies of the past.Cal Thomas is one of America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist in the U.S. He is the author of several books.

203,Puerto Rico votes in favor of statehood,Ruth Brown,2017-06-11,"Puerto Ricans on Sunday voted overwhelmingly in favor of becoming America’s 51st state — at least the ones who bothered going to the polls. Around 97 percent of those casting ballots opted in favor of statehood, according to late returns. But only about 500,000 Puerto Ricans — about 23 percent of the electorate — voted. Many groups who support the status quo urged a boycott of the vote, while others just didn’t turn up because it was a non-binding referendum. The non-binding vote meant that the US Congress would still have to agree to make the island a state — and American lawmakers are unlikely to comply given the isle is crippled with debt and unemployment. US Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-NY), who was born in Puerto Rico, dismissed the process as a “dog and pony show” and said the low turnout means the results can’t be trusted. “This plebiscite failed to live up to that standard, and the deck was stacked throughout the process,’’ she said in a statement. “With members of two of the three major political parties in Puerto Rico boycotting the vote, we can safely assume the results do not even remotely reflect public sentiment on the Island.” About 1.3 million Puerto Ricans cast ballots in the last referendum in 2012, which also saw a majority support for statehood. Aside from the 97 percent voting for statehood this time around, a little more than 1.5 percent voted in favor of independence from the US, while 1.3 percent wanted to preserve status quo and remain a territory.

135,Puerto Rico mulls political status in new referendum,,2017-06-11,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Puerto Ricans got the chance Sunday to tell the U.S. Congress which political status they want for a U.S. territory mired in an economic crisis that has triggered an exodus of islanders to the mainland.Congress has final say over whether to approve the outcome of the referendum that offers voters three choices: statehood, free association/independence or the current territorial status.Statehood supporters were expected to dominate the vote because three parties that favor other options were boycotting, including the island's main opposition party.Among those hoping Puerto Rico will become the 51st state is Ana Maria Garcia, a 52-year-old business administrator who arrived with her family on bicycle to vote early Sunday.""Puerto Rico would benefit greatly from being a state right now given the crisis,"" she said. ""It would offer stability.""Many believe the island's territorial status has contributed to its 10-year economic recession, which was largely sparked by decades of heavy borrowing and the elimination of federal tax incentives.Puerto Rico is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, but it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes and receives less federal funding than U.S. states.The referendum coincides with the 100th anniversary of the United States granting U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, though they are barred from voting in presidential elections and have only one congressional representative with limited voting powers.""I believe in the principle of equality,"" said Moraima Mendez, an attorney who studied in Indiana and voted for statehood. ""I want to stand eye-to-eye with the U.S. .... I want everyone here to have everything I had over there.""Nearly half a million Puerto Ricans have moved to the U.S. mainland in the past decade to find a more affordable cost of living or jobs as the island of 3.4 million people struggles with a 12 percent unemployment rate.Those who remain behind have been hit with new taxes and higher utility bills on an island where food is 22 percent more expensive than the U.S. mainland and public services are 64 percent more expensive.Those who oppose statehood worry the island will lose its cultural identity and warn that Puerto Rico will struggle even more financially because it will be forced to pay millions of dollars in federal taxes.""The cost of statehood on the pocketbook of every citizen, every business, every industry will be devastating,"" Carlos Delegado, secretary of the opposition Popular Democratic Party, told The Associated Press. ""Whatever we might receive in additional federal funds will be cancelled by the amount of taxes the island will have to pay.""His party also has noted that the U.S. Justice Department has not backed the referendum.A department spokesman told the AP that the agency has not reviewed or approved the ballot's language. Federal officials in April rejected an original version, in part because it did not offer the territory's current status as an option. The administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello added it and sent the ballot back for review, but the department said it needed more time and asked that the vote be postponed, which it wasn't.Sunday's referendum is the fifth for Puerto Rico.No clear majority emerged in the first three referendums, with voters almost evenly divided between statehood and the status quo. During the last referendum in 2012, 54 percent said they wanted a status change. Sixty-one percent who answered a second question said they favored statehood, but nearly half a million voters left that question blank, leading many to claim the results were not legitimate.Some statehood supporters on Sunday expressed dismay that certain voting centers appeared empty.""We are worse off than I thought, in the sense that we don't give a damn what happens to this island,"" said Jose Miranda, a retired TV and radio producer who lived 30 years in the U.S. mainland and is returning because he believes life is better over there.He also criticized austerity measures including imposing new taxes to help turn around the island's economy.""That's a pipe dream,"" he said.

204,Puerto Rico governor is searching for ‘clarity’ on $74B debt,Carleton English,2017-05-27,"Hedge fund managers are feeling pain during what Puerto Rico’s governor said is one of the “most challenging times” in the island’s financial history. At issue are the billions hedge funds such as Aurelius Capital Management, Monarch Alternative Capital and Tilden Park Capital Management poured into the commonwealth’s bonds a few years ago. As Puerto Rico sought bankruptcy-like relief for its $74 billion debt load on May 3, the hedgies that own some of that debt filed lawsuits one day before to determine who gets paid first. “The initial problem is that there was really never clarity on this issue … it’s really in the court’s hands.” Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló told The Post on Friday. Aurelius and Monarch own $1.4 billion in general obligation (GO) bonds while Tilden Park along with Whitebox Advisors and Merced Partners own $1.9 billion of sales-tax revenue — or Cofina — bonds. “The prevailing wisdom is that, of course, the GOs and Cofinas are somehow a higher echelon and others are subsequent to that.” Rosselló said. All of the money available for debt repayment was put together in one pool earlier this year, causing tensions among the creditors. As the pool does not cover the total debt, the haircut the bondholders are expected to take is “about 75 percent,” Rosselló said. Whether that haircut is shared equally among creditors will be decided in court. “We weren’t here to determine who was going to be number 1, number 2, number 3… It’s in the process and we’ll see how it unfolds,” Rosselló said.

Ricardo Rossello in a statement on Wednesday.PUERTO RICO HIT WITH 1ST LAWSUIT FROM BONDHOLDERSPuerto Rico is barred from traditional bankruptcy because it is a U.S. territory. The case was filed under Title III of the PROMESA law, which allows an in-court debt restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy protection.The process will give Puerto Rico the legal ability to impose drastic discounts on creditor recoveries, but could also spook investors and prolong the island's lack of access to debt markets.Unlike a regular bankruptcy on the U.S. mainland, a judge cannot unilaterally seize any of Puerto Rico's assets without prior authorization from the federal control board.It is the biggest restructuring ever by a local government, far larger than Detroit’s.""The governor needed to show that his primary allegiance lies with the citizens of Puerto Rico, and that was the justification for the filing,"" said David Tawil, whose fund, Maglan Capital, held Puerto Rico GO debt but has since sold it. ""I’m not sure whether bondholders are going to get any better treatment or recovery under this course of action.""PUERTO RICANS PROTEST ON MAY DAY AS DEBT DEADLINE NEARSThe legal proceeding does not mean negotiations toward a consensual restructuring agreement must stop, the governor said.""It is my hope that the Government’s Title III proceedings will accelerate the negotiation process,"" the governor said in the statement.Rossello's fiscal plan for the island, approved by the oversight board in March, forecasts Puerto Rico having only $800 million a year to pay debt, less than a quarter of what it owes. The low figure alienated creditors, and negotiations toward a restructuring deal have foundered.In addition to its debt, Puerto Rico is facing a 45 percent poverty rate, a shrinking population and unemployment more than twice the U.S. average.Puerto Rico and its general obligation bondholders, whose $18 billion of debt is backed by the island's constitution, were negotiating until the last minute.Reuters and AP contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-requests-unprecedented-bankruptcy-protection-for-70b-debt,Fox,Conservative

He said the buildings also could be used as drug treatment centers, business incubators or tutoring centers.""We're seeking new uses for these buildings so they don't turn into eyesores like in previous years,"" he said.Skeptics of Rossello's plan note that the majority of the 150 schools that were closed from 2010 to 2015 remain abandoned because there is no money to rehabilitate them.Puerto Rico is mired in a decade-long recession and has seen its school enrollment drop 42 percent in the past three decades amid an exodus to the U.S. mainland. The closures are part of the U.S. territory's measures to confront that crisis.The government also said Tuesday that it is revising a proposed austerity budget for the upcoming fiscal year after a federal control board demanded it be improved.Elias Sanchez, the governor's representative to the board, said the board is seeking more information on previous government spending to help it check estimated revenue projections for upcoming years.The board created by Congress oversees Puerto Rico's spending while giving it some protection from creditors as it tries to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt load. It said Monday that it's giving the government two weeks more to submit an amended budget.The budget isn't yet public and many Puerto Ricans fear it will bring even greater austerity measures.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-aims-to-rehabilitate-179-schools-after-closing,Fox,Conservative
205,Radicals & cynical pols are ruining the Puerto Rico Day Parade,Post Editorial Board,2017-05-17,"Unrepentant terrorist Oscar López Rivera will lead next month’s National Puerto Rican Day Parade down Fifth Avenue as a “National Freedom Hero.” And for that, you can fault City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito — and state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who handed her and her allies control of the parade. Using the parade (on its 60th anniversary, no less) to push a far-left agenda isn’t cost-free. It’s clearly why Goya Foods ended its decades-long sponsorship, costing the parade $200,000 for music, floats and scholarships. State Sen. Rubén Díaz Sr. (D-Bronx) blames Schneiderman for handing control of the parade committee to the radicals. As he notes, the AG used his investigation of misconduct at the charity to install new leadership in 2014 — for which Mark-Viverito, whose faction won control, publicly thanked him. Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez, the head of the parade board (and a senior adviser to Mayor de Blasio) says it was happy to invite López Rivera because it considers him innocent. Hmm: President Bill Clinton offered him clemency back in the ’90s — if he renounced violence. López Rivera refused. (Sadly, President Barack Obama wasn’t as picky.) Back in the ’70s, 120-odd bombings by López Rivera’s FALN terrorized innocents across America. The 1974 terror attack on Fraunces Tavern here in the city killed four. Yet the cause was pathetic: In multiple referenda, the voters of Puerto Rico have rejected independence time and again. Limousine liberals like Mark-Viverito and her circle can afford to romanticize a lost cause and ignore the lives shattered in its name. And ambitious politicians like Schneiderman can take political profit from playing along. Too bad they have the power to ruin a fine parade in their selfishness.

139,Puerto Rico pushes to privatize operation of public services,,2017-04-20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico is ready to sign dozens of new deals to privatize the operation of public services as government funds dwindle amid a decade-long recession, the island's governor told some 800 investors attending a two-day financial summit Thursday.Gov. Ricardo Rossello said public-private partnerships could create up to 100,000 new jobs and generate some $5 billion in the next three years for a U.S. territory mired in economic crisis and its government facing a $70 billion public debt load that it is struggling to restructure.""We are not leaving things to chance,"" he said, noting that Puerto Rico has no access to capital markets. ""We are building a government that recognizes we can't do everything.""Most public-private partnerships on the U.S. mainland involve transportation projects, but officials said the scope would be much wider in Puerto Rico and that the projects would not require legislative approval. The government hopes to privatize services including the operation and maintenance of several highways and the unreliable ferry service from Puerto Rico to the popular islands of Culebra and Vieques. Other projects would target waste management, student housing, parking and recreation facilities, information technology, renewable energy and natural gas projects.""We've been so aggressive about this because we have no other option,"" said Omar Marrero, executive director of the Authority of Public-Private Partnerships. ""Either we swim together, or we sink together.""Government officials have pledged that 25 percent of revenues from those deals will go to the island's crumbling public pension system that is underfunded by $40 billion and expected to run out of money this year.Officials have identified at least 30 projects that would benefit from being run by a private company and said they would guarantee badly needed maintenance and upgrades the government cannot afford. Puerto Rico can no longer keep financing the bulk of the island's development, said Elias Sanchez, the government's representative to a federal control board overseeing the island's finances.""It's just not viable,"" he said. ""Our fiscal situation is so challenging that there's no way the government can be the lead in investments or projects ... That can only be led by the private sector.""It's been roughly four years since Puerto Rico last signed a deal to privatize the operation of public services without complete privatization. The previous governor signed a deal to privatize operations at Puerto Rico's main international airport and its busiest highway, a move that allowed a previous administration to eliminate 60 percent of the Ports Authority's debt and pay $1 billion worth of highway debt.Government officials sought to ease any concerns about Puerto Rico's economic crisis by noting that the federal control board has to approve any projects, and that a financial package approved by U.S. Congress last year allows the government to award expedited permits to projects considered critical to the economy.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-pushes-to-privatize-operation-of-public-services,Fox,Conservative

141,Outages increase as Puerto Rico company crumbles amid crisis,,2017-04-11,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Spoiled food. Damaged appliances. Shuttered businesses.A recent increase in power outages is taking a heavy toll on Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory's heavily indebted public power company struggles to modernize decades-old equipment that is crumbling amid a deep economic crisis.The frequent loss of power, coupled with rising power bills, is spooking potential investors. It has frustrated business owners who complain of lost revenue and forced homeowners to buy new appliances amid unexpected surges.""It's never been worse,"" Mariela Aguirre, a 49-year-old sales trainer, said of the weekly outages in her neighborhood tucked in an upscale suburb near the capital. ""This is turning into a Third World country.""The cycle of homes and businesses being plunged into darkness only to be jolted awake by appliances that beep, whir and hum back to life has become common across the island for tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans such as Aguirre who cannot afford generators to offset the costly interruptions.Last year, the island of 3.4 million people reported more than 54,000 power failures, a 24 percent increase compared with 2014. Outages in Puerto Rico overall are up to five times higher than those experienced by customers in the U.S. mainland, according to a report published in November by independent, U.S.-based experts at the request of a local commission charged with improving the power company.The scathing analysis of more than 200 pages says the power company faces an emergency that must be addressed immediately, warning that its generation and transmission infrastructure is ""literally falling apart.""""(The company) appears to be running on fumes, and in our opinion desperately requires an infusion of capital - monetary, human, and intellectual - to restore a functional utility,"" the experts wrote.But Puerto Rico's government cannot provide any kind of cash infusion. It faces major budget cuts in the upcoming months as it struggles to find revenue and restructure some $70 billion in public debt during a decade-long recession. The Electric Power Authority holds roughly $9 billion of that debt, and has reached a tentative deal reached with bondholders after nearly three years' worth of negotiations.The power company hasn't found new sources of revenue given that Puerto Rico has no access to the capital markets. Meanwhile, outages continue to vex its more than 1.5 million customers.""You hear all the pings, and you're like, 'Oh, God, everything's going to break down on me,'"" Elizabeth Laide, a 50-year-old swimming instructor, said of her appliances.She lives near the capital of San Juan and has power outages twice a week lasting anywhere from six to 12 hours. Her washing machine already stopped working, and she keeps her grocery lists short because she doesn't want food to spoil.Laide also has stopped calling the power company.""You get tired of waiting on the line,"" she said. ""It's something you can't fight.""Edgardo Rivera, the new director of the power company's transmission and distribution system, blamed the majority of outages on long overdue improvements that require crews to disconnect power for several hours.""Of course we can do better, that's our goal,"" he said, adding he expects the improvements will reduce outages.But many Puerto Ricans remain wary, especially after the entire island lost power last September in a three-day blackout affecting 1.5 million utility customers.A fire at a main power plant caused the blackout, but most outages are blamed on deferred maintenance, bad weather, overgrown trees, crumbling infrastructure and lack of skilled workers, according to the report by independent U.S. experts. The study noted that the power company's workforce is now 22 percent slimmer than it was in 2014. Outages also have become longer, now lasting more than two hours on average.""(The company) is barely able to provide electric service with its present fleet and dispatches its units with software that was developed in 1985,"" the experts said in their report. ""Its approaches to problem-solving are often improvised, with results that are disastrous as often as they are admirable.""The company also has been plagued by allegations of corruption and mismanagement and is now struggling with a fresh round of negotiations with bondholders.More islanders demand that the company be privatized in hopes service will improve, but Puerto Rico economist Jose Joaquin Villamil considers that unrealistic.""That requires a large investment, and it's not very likely that a private firm will find this a very attractive proposition,"" he said.Amid the outages, Puerto Ricans try to find humor in their situation. A popular meme during Puerto Rico's recent undefeated run to the World Baseball Classic finals reads, ""I ask that the power company give us electricity from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.,"" referring to the game's scheduled time.Islanders also have become used to the boom of exploding transformers followed by a string of expletives from those living or working nearby.Jose Garriga, who owns a large Puerto Rico refrigeration and ventilation company, said the power at his headquarters near San Juan and other nearby properties goes out at least once a week.""Sometimes you'll have two transformers explode, one after another,"" he said. ""Everyone in Puerto Rico needs a generator.

206,Yadier Molina shames Adam Jones for mocking Puerto Rico’s joy,Hannah Withiam,2017-03-23,"When the United States and Puerto Rico should have been celebrating their deep runs in the World Baseball Classic, a day after the Americans took home the title with an 8-0 win, Adam Jones and Yadier Molina let their tempers flare over the festivities themselves. Molina responded to Jones’ postgame criticism Thursday, demanding the Orioles center fielder apologize for calling Puerto Rico’s celebratory plans premature. “Adam Jones … is talking about things he doesn’t know about,” Molina told ESPN during a parade honoring him and his teammates in San Juan. “He really has to get informed because he shouldn’t have said those comments, let alone in public and mocking the way [preparations] were made.” Jones scoffed at what he considered Puerto Rico’s red-carpet-style welcome following Wednesday night’s game, including championship T-shirts and a “caravan” through the streets of the capital city — even though they lost. Jones told MLB Network the pregame chatter surrounding Puerto Rico’s WBC exploits “didn’t sit well with us,” and inspired the Americans to put together such a dominant performance. Molina argued Jones was judging the Puerto Ricans, both players and fans, without understanding the cultural significance attached to their undefeated run into the tournament final. Puerto Rico intended to celebrate its WBC showing whether it won or lost. “He has to apologize to the Puerto Rican people,” the Cardinals catcher said. “Obviously, you wanted to win; he didn’t know what this means to [our] people. “That’s why I’m sending a message to [Jones], saying, ‘Look at this, right now you’re in spring training working out, and we’re with our people, with our silver medals. You’re in spring training and you’re working. … You have no idea how to celebrate your honors, you don’t know what it means.'” Molina’s Cardinals visit Jones’ Orioles for an interleague series in Baltimore from June 16-18. Puerto Rico’s success in the tournament swept across the island with fans showing their support by bleaching their hair in solidarity with the players. “We have been able to unite our country with our blond hair,” shortstop Carlos Correa said of the ritual, which caught on as Puerto Rico continued to win. “That’s what we want as players — to unite our country, our people, and give them the best.” ",https://nypost.com/2017/03/23/yadier-molina-shames-adam-jones-for-mocking-puerto-ricos-joy/,New York Post,Conservative
207,Canada just bought half of Puerto Rico’s main airport,Josh Kosman,2017-03-22,"Canada’s army is getting ready to invade Puerto Rico’s airport. The pension fund for the Canadian armed forces has won an auction to buy 50 percent of the company that operates Puerto Rico’s main airport in San Juan, The Post has learned. Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board has acquired the airport stake from Oaktree Capital, the hedge fund run by billionaire Howard Marks, who has managed the investment amid a financial crisis that has crippled the Caribbean island’s economy, sources said. “Traffic at the airport is not what they hoped it would be,” a source said. The threat of the Zika virus is also denting the tourist economy. In addition, San Juan is being edged out by Miami’s airport as the go-to hub for travelers to the region. “It’s disquieting” that Oaktree is exiting after less than five years, the source added. While Puerto Rico is getting paired with an operating partner it doesn’t know, Oaktree may still have gotten its desired return as it improved the concessions area and cut costs, including what it pays for air conditioning, insiders said. Oaktree had acquired the management stake in 2014 when it bought AIG’s Highstar Capital. Mexican airport operator Aeroportuario del Sureste owns the other half of the airport and jointly operates it. AIG and its Mexican partner in 2012 paid $615 million to the cash-strapped Puerto Rico Ports Authority for a 40-year airport concession, agreeing to share revenue and invest an additional $1.4 billion in the airport over the course of the lease. San Juan’s passenger boardings from 2011 to year end 2015 have risen by 5 percent, while Miami’s have jumped 15 percent, according to FAA data. San Juan’s Luis Muñoz International is the only airport in North America completely run by a private operator. New York’s LaGuardia International Airport in 2016 turned to private operators to build and manage a terminal. More airport privatizations may be coming if President Trump succeeds in implementing his infrastructure plans. Oaktree declined to comment. The Canada pension fund didn’t return calls.

208,Puerto Rico pushes US to the brink,Associated Press,2017-03-18,"SAN DIEGO — Puerto Rico is squeezing every bit of fun it can out of this World Baseball Classic. Come Monday night, the party moves on to Dodger Stadium. Yadier Molina and Puerto Rico advanced to the WBC semifinals after scoring four runs in the first inning and then holding on for a wild 6-5 win against the United States on Friday night. When Edwin Diaz struck out Josh Harrison to end the game with Brandon Crawford standing on third base, players raced out of the Puerto Rico dugout to join the celebration on the infield. After a few minutes in the clubhouse, the team returned to the field waving small flags and ran over to celebrate with a large group of fans on the first-base side who were chanting, beating drums, rattling noisemakers and waving flags. “We are happy for the job all the guys have done,” Carlos Beltran said. “I think the boys have done a good job playing for their country. We’re happy for our country and for our people. They are very proud of us and we hope to God we finish the mission.” Puerto Rico advanced to the championship round for the second straight WBC. It reached the championship game in 2013 before losing to the Dominican Republic. By clinching Pool F with a day to go, Puerto Rico (2-0) will play the Netherlands on Monday night at Dodger Stadium. The other semifinal spot from Pool F will go to the winner of Saturday night’s game between the United States (1-1) and the Dominican Republic (1-1). That team will play Japan on Tuesday night. Puerto Rico took a 4-0 lead in the first, watched Buster Posey and Adam Jones hit impressive home runs, and then benefited from a two-run, two-base, two-out throwing error in the sixth by third baseman Nolan Arenado, who won the Gold Glove Award in each of his first four big league seasons. With most of the 32,463 fans on their feet and chanting in the top of the ninth, a U.S. rally fell just short. Crawford hit a two-run triple to the left-center gap off Diaz with two outs to pull the Americans within a run and spark chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” Diaz then struck out Josh Harrison for his second save to send the Puerto Ricans into a frenzy. Backup catcher Roberto Perez carried a Puerto Rican flag with him onto the field. Puerto Rico can sweep the pool when it plays Venezuela (0-2) on Saturday afternoon. Puerto Rico beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 on Tuesday night. “They are a very good team and they are doing a lot of things right,” U.S. manager Jim Leyland said. “You tip your hat to them.” The United States will have to regroup to face a Dominican Republic team it lost to one week earlier in the opening round in Miami. In that game, Nelson Cruz hit a go-ahead, three-run home run in the eighth as the Dominicans rallied from five runs down to win 7-5. Puerto Rico took a 4-0 lead on six straight singles and a sacrifice fly in first inning off Marcus Stroman. Carlos Correa, Beltran and Molina had RBI singles in Puerto Rico’s opening onslaught. Stroman finally got an out when Rosario hit a sacrifice fly to make it 4-0. Molina tried taking third on the play but overran the bag and was tagged out. Stroman got Rivera to fly out to right to end it. “The first inning was just incredible,” Beltran said. “It gave us so much confidence for the rest of the game.” The United States pulled to 4-3 on Eric Hosmer’s RBI single in the second and then homers by Posey leading off the fifth and Jones with one out in the sixth, both off starter Seth Lugo. Posey’s second homer of the tourney went an estimated 398 feet to left-center. Jones, who played at San Diego’s Morse High, homered for the second time in two games. Puerto Rico regained a cushion in the sixth on the error by Arenado, who short-hopped a throw to first after fielding a grounder by Angel Pagan that took a high bounce. Leadoff batter Javier Baez was hit by a pitch from Mychal Givens and stole second. Andrew Miller came on and walked Eddie Rosario. With T.J. Rivera batting, Baez and Rosario pulled a double steal. Rivera and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez struck out. Pagan’s grounder took a wicked hop and Arenado fielded it above his shoulders. He got set, but his throw skipped past Hosmer, and Baez and Rosario scored. “That is just part of the game,” Leyland said. “That is the human element of it. That is a great third baseman. I have no problem whatsoever with that.” Lugo (1-0) allowed three runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings, struck out two and walked one. Stroman (0-1) allowed four runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings, struck out two and walked one. ",https://nypost.com/2017/03/18/puerto-rico-pushes-us-to-the-brink/,New York Post,Conservative

145,Puerto Rico's new gov signs controversial labor reform law,,2017-01-26,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico's new governor has signed a much-debated labor reform bill that targets the private sector and aims to stimulate the island's economy amid concerns that it infringes on workers' rights.The law approved on Thursday implements flexible scheduling, cuts the amount of a mandatory Christmas bonus, reduces vacation days and overtime pay from double time to time-and-a-half, and implements a nine-month probation period for most workers. It also strikes down a previous law that authorized extra pay for those working on Sundays and allowed businesses to remain closed from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Sundays.Opponents warn the law will worsen the exodus of Puerto Rico professionals to the U.S. mainland, while supporters believe it will stimulate investment and create jobs in part by lowering the cost of doing business in the U.S. territory.""In the last 10 years, we've lost nearly 300,000 jobs, and this has prompted Puerto Ricans to move to Florida and other places in search of jobs and quality of life,"" Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. ""It's time to stop this migration and the separation of families.""The law implements some of the changes sought by a federal control board created by Congress last year that said Puerto Rico regulations tied to employee retention, severance pay, flexible scheduling and mandatory vacation days and pensions should reflect U.S. standards.The new law now allows private employees to work 10 hours a day for four days without earning overtime, and it increases unemployment benefits from a maximum of $133 to $240 a week.However, concerns remain as the island of nearly 3.5 million people struggles to emerge from a deep economic crisis and battles a 12 percent unemployment rate, compared with a U.S. average of nearly 5 percent.""People will grow more impoverished and will spend less,"" Rep. Ramon Luis Cruz said in a phone interview. ""This will slow down the economy instead of advance it.""He said the law also anticipates an ongoing push to privatize certain government agencies and establish more public-private partnerships.""This has been well planned,"" he said.The law is the latest of several that Rossello has signed in a bid to stimulate the economy as the federal control board pushes for an increase in the number of austerity measures.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-ricos-new-gov-signs-controversial-labor-reform-law,Fox,Conservative
146,Puerto Rico tries to open no-man's-land to tourism,,2017-01-25,"VIEQUES, Puerto Rico  A small island long known as a Navy bombing range is gradually trying to turn a no-man's-land into a booming tourist mecca.Vieques, off the east coast of Puerto Rico, boasts gorgeous beaches, turquoise waters and a stunning bioluminescent bay. But for more than 70 years, most of the island has been off-limits to non-military visitors. Tons of unexploded bombs, rockets and other munitions still lie scattered across the eastern half of the island and the surrounding seabed.One side effect is that much of the island remains tantalizingly undeveloped, a wildlife refuge whose verdant hills and white-sand beaches attracts some 170 bird species and are popular nesting places for leatherback, hawksbill and green sea turtles.""They're the bread and butter of Vieques,"" said Mike Barandiaran, manager of the Vieques National Wildlife Refuge for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. ""The tourist that comes here wants the wild, natural area. And it generates a lot of revenue."" About 67,000 visitors came to the refuge last year, up from 24,000 in recent years.The Naval Training Range shut down in 2001 and since then the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated much of it as a Superfund site believed to contain contaminants including mercury, lead and napalm. The U.S. Navy has been working under orders to clean up as much of the place as possible to make it more hospitable for tourists and the more than 9,000 locals alike.Many activists and Puerto Rico's health department argue that the years of exposure to dangerous substances have led to significantly higher rates of cancer and other health problems. Officials with the island's previous administration began a process to obtain as much as $1 billion in compensation for environmental damage, but it is unclear if the new administration will pursue that effort.Federal studies have challenged those assertions and Dan Waddill, the Navy's Vieques restoration branch head, said the Navy has done extensive environmental sampling and air monitoring and has found no violations.""We are very sensitive to the public's concerns about health, but all our work is done in a way that's protective of human health and the environment,"" he said.The cleanup already has cost more than $220 million, and it's expected to extend for more than another decade. So far, crews on land have removed some 31,000 bombs, 1,300 rockets and 600 grenades among other items, some of which were practice rounds, Waddill said. Nobody's sure how much remains.This year alone, the Navy plans to scour 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of seabed to map areas containing unexploded ordnance to be removed by divers and robots — eventually opening new beaches and reefs to swimmers and divers.Overall, some 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) of land in Vieques has been re-opened since the cleanup began, and officials hope eventually to open another 16 square miles (41 square kilometers), Barandiaran said. That would create an overall wilderness area about the size of Washington, D.C.Barandiaran said another 2 square miles (5.2 square kilometers) will remain permanently closed to the public for safety reasons.Tourism already has been growing in Vieques — a boon to the small population of which nearly half live below the poverty level. The island offers horseback riding, snorkeling adventures and trips to a popular bioluminescent bay, one of only a handful in the world.The high-end W Retreat & Spa resort opened in northern Vieques in 2010, and a growing number of hotels, restaurants and vacation homes have opened since.Tourists this year expect to get access to parts of a zone in western Vieques that once served as munition storage depot. Federal authorities said hunting will for the first time be allowed on Vieques at this site, adding that the 400 acres (162 hectares) also will offer hiking, biking, horse and bird-watching trails. That's encouraging news for Michigan tourist Michelle Brinker, who was visiting Vieques this month for the third time with her husband.""We love this island, and it's nice to see areas like this opening up to the public,"" said Brinker, a 40-year-old pharmacist from Ann Arbor. ""It would be nice to hike more in those restricted areas.

147,Official: Puerto Rico govt could collapse if no steps taken,,2017-01-17,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  The administration of Puerto Rico's new governor warned on Tuesday that the U.S. territory government could shut down if dramatic measures to offset the economic crisis aren't taken soon.The warning came as officials released new data provided by the previous governor during the transition process that it says shows the crisis is even worse than previously believed.""If we don't make a dramatic adjustment, there could be a total collapse in upcoming months,"" said Elias Sanchez, the governor's representative to a federal control board created last year to oversee Puerto Rico's finances.He told reporters that the extent of the fiscal crisis is still unknown, in part because of a lack of communication between public agencies. Overall, Puerto Rico is seeking to restructure its nearly $70 billion in public debt, and the island has defaulted on millions of dollars' worth of bond payments since August, angering creditors who have filed multiple lawsuits.The report released on Tuesday states that the island's Department of Education has a $230 million deficit, the police department a $45 million deficit, and that the Highway Authority owes suppliers more than $500 million.The report also states that Puerto Rico's largest public university has $91 million deposited in the Government Development Bank that it cannot access because of an ongoing debt moratorium. In addition, officials say the bank, which oversees the island's debt transactions, turned over its routing number last April and has not issued a check since. All of the bank's deposits have been moved to private banks.""The crisis is real and more severe than people think,"" Sanchez said.Puerto Rico has a multimillion-dollar bond payment due in February, but Sanchez said it's too early to say whether it will be made. He said the government will talk with the federal control board in upcoming days about that payment.""We're going to see what kind of agreement we can reach,"" he said.Rossello's administration already has requested an extension on a deadline to turn in a revised fiscal plan that the board is supposed to approve by Jan. 31. Officials also have asked for an extension on a moratorium that temporarily protects Puerto Rico from creditor lawsuits. The board has not responded publicly to those requests.Meanwhile, Rossello's administration has pledged to restructure the government to reduce costs as well as reform the island's tax and retirement systems. Rossello already signed several executive orders aimed at turning around the economic crisis, including ordering agencies to reduce their budgets and contracts for professional services by 10 percent.He also has submitted a labor reform bill that seeks to cut the size of a mandatory Christmas bonus and the required number of vacation and sick days granted to workers. Puerto Rico's Senate is debating the bill amid a growing number of protests.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/official-puerto-rico-govt-could-collapse-if-no-steps-taken,Fox,Conservative
148,"Opinion: Puerto Rico needs more businesses like Herbalife, whose model provides opportunity to all",Justin Vélez-Hagan,2017-01-11,"Puerto Rico’s economic struggles are no secret. The Internet is full of opinion pieces criticizing policies that may have contributed to its continued economic decline, the mass exodus of young professionals seeking better opportunities elsewhere, and an ever-increasing government debt that also affects the millions of Americans who’ve invested in Puerto Rico’s bonds. However, few have delved into the dramatic impact that eight years of economic decay have had on Puerto Rican entrepreneurship. As an economist, and the founder of a relatively new organization dedicated to the development of Puerto Rican businesses, I’ve seen firsthand just how important it is to foster entrepreneurship on the island.A recent study of global entrepreneurship found that only 28 percent of Puerto Ricans think there are still good opportunities to start a business on the island, down from 35 percent in 2007 and nearly half the percentage of those polled in the U.S. and the rest of Latin America. Currently only 2 percent of the population are business owners (compared to 7.5 percent in the U.S.), despite the majority of islanders stating they have the skills and desire to start a business.Puerto Rico has had its share of struggles, especially over the last decade. If it is to turn the economic corner and begin growing again, economists agree that entrepreneurship has to be a major economic driver.Given the poor numbers, the government has enacted a series of incentives to attract foreign investment and boost entrepreneurial activity. Non-profit organizations, like my own, along with universities and government agencies are all banding together to change perceptions and increase small business growth.Yet, one company, who has given over 2,000 Puerto Ricans the opportunity to start their own business, has come under attack from some of the very organizations who seek to better the lives of average Puerto Ricans.Since its founding in 1980, Herbalife (NYSE: HLF) has used its network marketing business model to offer an opportunity for hundreds of thousands of individuals around the world to invest in and start their own small business. Their model is one of the few that is specifically appealing and available to low income individuals in areas of the world where few options for employment exist. In fact, Herbalife has more than 120,000 members in Latin America (where incomes are far lower, and inequality is far higher than in the U.S.).Since joining Herbalife, more than 2,000 people now contribute to Puerto Rico’s economy that might otherwise not have an opportunity to do so. (If these were full-time employees of a single company, they would comprise one of Puerto Rico’s largest private employers.)  These members either purchase discounted nutrition products for personal use or have started their own small businesses selling to others.Despite being in the middle of a severe recession, royalties paid to Herbalife’s business owners in Puerto Rico have more than tripled between 2012 and 2013. I doubt many other businesses on the island can lay claim to similar success.With unemployment stagnating at more than twice the national rate  not including the large number of long-term unemployed or those in its immense informal economy  the historically entrepreneurial Puerto Rican population is increasingly turning to businesses similar to Herbalife for an opportunity to earn a living.Yet, despite this growing demand, some have publicly derided Herbalife’s business model. One of the loudest detractors is an institutional investor who stands to earn nearly $2 billion if Herbalife fails. It would be kind to call his opinion biased.Others are concerned that Hispanics are more susceptible to be taken advantage of by Herbalife’s business model, while finding no fault in other, even larger companies who rely on the same business practices.These organizations’ biggest concerns surround the possibility of losing money in new business ventures. Yet, common sense has taught us all that there is an inherent risk in starting a new business and neither Herbalife, nor any other similar company, denies this. Without risk, there can be no reward. Stating that Hispanics lack this understanding is either disingenuous, or a little insulting.Millions of people around the world have earned an income from networking marketing companies such as Alticor (Amway), Avon, Mary Kay, Tupperware, and Primerica. Herbalife is no different. In fact, I would say that Herbalife provides an opportunity that caters more specifically to those who are in greatest need and stand to gain the most from a new business venture, while it simultaneously has one of the best consumer protection policies in the industry, including 100 percent refund guarantees (even for shipping costs) for the return of all unsold products purchased in the prior 12 months if a member decides to stop selling Herbalife products for any reason. Most entrepreneurs endure much greater risks when starting their own ventures.Puerto Rico has had its share of struggles, especially over the last decade. If it is to turn the economic corner and begin growing again, economists agree that entrepreneurship has to be a major economic driver. Neither the government of Puerto Rico, nor the hundreds of benevolent non-profit organizations offering a helping hand to Puerto Ricans can make that happen without the private sector. And with a relatively poor population, Puerto Rico needs more organizations like Herbalife whose business model is one of the few that can provide an opportunity to all budding entrepreneurs, regardless of their income level.After nearly a decade in recession, every policy alternative must be considered and every opportunity that has the possibility of helping to increase entrepreneurship in Puerto Rico should be advocated for, including and especially those that can offer a chance to those from every socioeconomic background.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/opinion-puerto-rico-needs-more-businesses-like-herbalife-whose-model-provides-opportunity-to-all,Fox,Conservative
149,"Opinion: Puerto Rico Statehood Is A Moral, Democratic And Economic Imperative",Larry Seilhamer,2017-01-11,"The myth that statehood is not good for the nation, created and supported by the usual suspects in the island and in Washington, has been dealt a devastating blow.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published the findings on how statehood for Puerto Rico would affect selected federal programs and revenue sources. The report clearly reveals that the state of Puerto Rico will not have a negative economic fiscal implication on the Federal Treasury. The bottom line is that in only five federal programs the island will see an increase of $5,465 million and individuals and corporations will contribute $7,200 million ($2.2 billion by individuals and $5 billion by corporations) to the nation’s treasury annually. By sabotaging the free and democratic decision of the electorate, the enemies of statehood in the island and in Washington have unilaterally decided to condemn the people of Puerto Rico to dire economic disadvantages.It is important to note that 7 out of 10 households in Puerto Rico will not pay taxes, and 70 percent of that amount will be paid by corporations. On the other hand, GAO also indicates that various federal programs  like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act  were not considered in their analysis. The fact is that the state of Puerto Rico will receive over $4,400 million in those programs annually. The report validates what has been proposed by the majority of the residents of the island; statehood is not only beneficial for Puerto Rico but also for the nation.Statehood, as stated in the report, will definitively raise Puerto Rico visibility as a place for United States producers to locate and would eliminate any risk associated with the island’s uncertain political status and any related deterrent to business investment, thus creating new and multiple job opportunities for the people of Puerto Rico. It is a historic fact that the economic activity, in both Alaska and Hawaii, flourished and grew exponentially after they became states.On November 2012, the people of Puerto Rico decided to reject the actual territorial/colonial status in a very clear fashion (54 percent of cast ballots). On the other question posed in the ballot, they selected statehood as their preferred permanent status solution (64 percent of valid ballots).The GAO report dramatically supports the decision taken by the majority of Puerto Ricans on November 2012. The figures show it is the right decision. Statehood not only recognizes the fundamental civil rights of the American citizens that live in the island, as they will vote for the Commander in Chief, two Senators and six members of Congress, but also gives them the opportunity to enjoy the economic prosperity and quality of life that their fellow citizens enjoy in the states. Prosperity and quality of life that more than 4.6 million Puerto Ricans are enjoying after being forced to relocate to the states.GAO facts and figures confirm that the median household income in Puerto Rico, after more than 100 years of the actual territorial/colonial status, is $18,160, compared to $36,919 for the lowest of the states, as opposed to $50,502 which is the median of the 50 states. Statehood will definitively give the island’s residents the opportunity to strive for economic growth. Notwithstanding the clear and unquestionable facts and figures revealed and confirmed by the GAO report, facts further prove the irreparable damages inflicted to the residents of the island by the actual territorial/colonial status. By sabotaging the free and democratic decision of the electorate, the enemies of statehood in the island and in Washington have unilaterally decided to condemn the people of Puerto Rico to dire economic disadvantages and lack of opportunities.Puerto Ricans spoke firmly in November 2012. GAO has spoken in March 2014. Now, it is Congress turn to speak by enabling the passage of H.R. 2000, the “Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act.”Statehood is the moral, democratic, and economic solution to redress the damages inflicted by the centenary territorial/colonial status to the people of Puerto Rico.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/opinion-puerto-rico-statehood-is-a-moral-democratic-and-economic-imperative,Fox,Conservative
150,Opinion: Koch brothers eye Puerto Rico,Gretchen Sierra-Zorita,2017-01-11,"Weighed by an eight-year recession and crushing debt, Puerto Rico’s economy is sinking fast. Its government is staying barely afloat by cutting services, raising taxes, and borrowing to pay its estimated $73 billion debt. The northward migration continues and Puerto Rico is being depopulated for the first time in its territorial history.Washington has yet to throw a lifeline. It has ruled out a bailout and offered no alternatives. Federal inaction has created a power vacuum that is being exploited by institutional investors. They are manipulating the market, public opinion, and even Congress at the expense of the Puerto Rican people.Federal action is definitely needed but it should address the interests of all American citizens not just the ones with political and economic clout.Groups of debt-holders and speculators are circling the Island like sharks looking for ways to improve their financial positions. One group is suing Puerto Rico over a new law allowing public corporations to restructure their debt. Another large group of hedge funds stands ready to finance the Puerto Rican government if it restructures some of its debt.A third group, with ties to the conservative Koch brothers, has taken a radically different approach. They have launched an aggressive disinformation campaign to discredit the Puerto Rican government. The objective is to pave the way for Federal action should Puerto Rico refuse to pay its creditors by equating it to a semi-foreign rogue state.The campaign started last summer when negotiations over a $230 million tax refund broke down between the Puerto Rican government and Doral Financial Corporation, a local bank that has not posted a profit since 2005. The response by the American Future Fund (AFF), a Koch-funded organization with no obvious ties to Doral or Puerto Rico, was fast and furious. The AFF ran ads in The Wall Street Journal and Politico likening Governor Garcia Padilla to presidents Kirchner of Argentina and Maduro of Venezuela, both heads of dysfunctional economies.The defamation campaign continued into the fall. High-profile ads accused Garcia Padilla of running a corrupt rogue government that violates the U.S. constitution and has transformed Puerto Rico into a major drug transit point. These allegations might resonate with an uninformed American audience but they are not true.In October a San Juan court ruled in favor of Doral on the tax dispute. The government filed an appeal. The Hispanic Leadership Fund, which has received Koch funding through one of their intermediary organizations, joined the fray, comparing Garcia Padilla to Cuba’s Castro.Doral and its public relations firm, the DCI Group, claim to have no AFF ties. Yet DCI’s managing partner, Justin Peterson, is an AFF donor. DCI has contracted former Republican Congressman Connie Mack to lobby on behalf of Doral.Since Mack came on board, Republican congressmen Jeff Duncan, Scott Garrett, Darrell Issa and Matt Salmon have inquired about the Doral case. All five have received Koch Industries PAC contributions and none had been previously involved in Puerto Rico.  There are only two democrats among Doral’s active supporters.Many Puerto Ricans believe the Doral lawsuit stems from a partisan dispute between current Governor Garcia Padilla, head of the pro-Commonwealth party and a Democrat, and former Governor Luis Fortuño, statehood supporter and prominent Republican.  The Garcia Padilla government maintains that the $230 million tax refund agreed to during Fortuño's administration was based on misrepresentation. Fortuño's Treasury Secretary is currently a top Doral official. Fortuño is also tied to the Koch network as a Hispanic Leadership Fund board member.What most Puerto Ricans do not realize is that the Doral case is part of a larger agenda. Conservative organizations and investors are using the Doral litigation to fabricate a picture of a rogue government that threatens U.S. business concerns. Whether they have a vested interest in Doral or not, their intent is to predispose the Federal government to act on their behalf should Puerto Rico show signs of defaulting.Some Doral supporters are proposing a Federal financial control board like the one that oversaw Washington D.C.’s finances for six years. This mechanism would ensure that Puerto Rico pays its creditors, but it would not correct flaws in the territory’s outdated economic model and would impose even greater hardships on its people.Puerto Ricans know they are responsible for their predicament. Every governor since the mid- 1970s has avoided making hard economic choices and borrowed money to balance budgets. But even under the best conditions, Puerto Rico’s economy is shackled by its territorial status and there are limits to what leaders can do.With no powerful champions in Washington it has become clear to the people of Puerto Rico that their American citizenship is worth pennies on the dollar. It would be unconscionable for the Federal government to step in now to protect business interests with no regard for the people of Puerto Rico. Federal action is definitely needed but it should address the interests of all American citizens not just the ones with political and economic clout.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/opinion-koch-brothers-eye-puerto-rico,Fox,Conservative

This can be a place of utter beauty, especially in May.The island is deep green from rain. Flamboyan trees shock with their leaves, red and yellow explosions of color. Erica and Sol are looking out the windows from the back seat.“So how’s (Gov. Luis) Fortuño doing,” I ask my old friend José Cuevas, who is driving our still reliable five-year-old Ford Escape. Views aside, in Puerto Rico 90 percent of conversations between men are of sex, sports or politics.We drive past the Jibaro statute that towers over the highway just as it cuts through the pass and the southern half of Puerto Rico spreads out before us. The open expanse of rolling green hills framed by the Caribbean Sea is breathtaking signal that we are almost home.“He’s doing better,” José answers my political question with a shrug that looks like a major concession.José is a strapping, shaved head, tattooed, pierced and confident 50-year-old local business/fisherman. He built and takes care of our place here, and he is a great sounding board about island politics.Way down on the governor after the pro-statehood Republican won by a record margin in 2008, José and his pals were angrier when the island’s recession persisted, and Fortuño aggravated the downturn by firing a bunch of state workers. José’s party, the pro-commonwealth Popular Democrats, howled in protest.But since, Fortuño has impressed even many opponents with his fiscal discipline and a relatively transparent, pragmatic, reasonable approach to governing in tough times. A member of the Republican National Committee and an ally of Mitt Romney, Fortuño has forced on Puerto Ricans a rare moment of national introspection.We are having a “Who are we” moment.Blame or credit Fortuño.For generations, we have comfortably postponed the reckoning of whether we are conquered or assimilated, taken or absorbed.Encyclopedias have been written on the subject.Not a Sunday newspaper is published or newscast aired without a sincere and impassioned debate on the status issue. But now Fortuño’s popularity is enhancing statehood’s prospects. His party has engineered a vote this coming November on what Puerto Rico is going to be.There have been periodic referenda on Puerto Rico’s status before -- namely in 1967, 1991, 1993 and 1998.On all four occasions, the small but vocal and energetic independence parties joined forces with those advocating the status quo to preserve the unsavory result that we are still “a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States.”Puerto Rico is a step-child in the family of nations.Our children are deemed “natural-born citizens” of the United States. They can run for president, but they can’t vote for president as long as they live on the island.However unsatisfactory, a bare majority of Puerto Ricans have supported this hybrid existence in previous plebiscites. Those advocating statehood have lagged two or three points behind inertia.This time may be different.On November 6, 2012 islanders will vote on whether they want to stay a territory or become something else. If they choose to finally shed the yoke of benevolent colonialism, then the second question will be: what do they want to be, a country, a state or have some enhanced phony semi-independence from the United States?As we arrive in Salinas where we live, José tells me statehood finally has a chance.Geraldo Rivera joined FOX News Channel as a war correspondent in 2001 and currently serves as a rotating co-host of The Five (weekdays, 5-6 PM/ET).",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/geraldo-rivera-puerto-rico-the-51st-state,Fox,Conservative

156,"After 63 years Puerto Rico as a commonwealth is ready for retirement, many say",Susanne Ramírez de Arellano,2017-01-02,"Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla this weekend reiterated that his priority is to strengthen the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and called on all Puerto Ricans to unite against a eight-year recession and a 73 billion dollar debt he has deemed “unpayable.”To shouts of “four more years,” Garcia Padilla made the call to action during his message celebrating the 63rd anniversary of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  known as the Estado Libre Asociado (Free Associated State), or ELA.Governor Luis Munoz Marin proclaimed the ELA on July 25, 1952. It made the island an unincorporated territory of the United States with a Constitution that afforded it a degree of autonomy. It cemented the island’s commonwealth status, promising Puerto Ricans a future of progress and prosperity.In his message, Garcia Padilla made it clear that the commonwealth is still the best political solution to Puerto Rico’s status.“We inherited a colossal crisis that no government has ever inherited. We have to face it in order to develop the commonwealth to the maximum,” he said. “It needs to grow and reach a climax. To achieve this change, we must be fair to all ideological sectors. And we will do so together, respecting those who think differently, in search for the good of all,” he added. Still, many believe that the main culprit of Puerto Rico’s current debacle is the commonwealth status itself, that euphemistic condition known as the “Free Associated State,” and that the time has come for a change.More than six decades after Munoz Marin ushered in this new association with the United States, Puerto Rico is not the island he envisioned.Shackled by the burden of a colonial status, a deteriorating economy heavily in debt, a soaring crime rate and the first sustained population decline since becoming a territory of the United States, it is no longer the U.S. “the showcase of the Caribbean.” It seems to have become more of a false miracle.Santos Negron Diaz, a prominent Puerto Rican economist, recently wrote in the nationalist Puerto Rican newspaper Claridad:“The economic crisis has revealed the political crisis and forces us to think that without an effective transition that provides us better and more effective instruments of economic policy, every effort toward an economic recovery will be condemned to fail. We can not continue to pour new wine in old wineskins.”“Cognitive dissonance 101, a la Boricua,” said Monica Perez, an environmental expert.“But what can you expect from a compromise that was foisted on Luis Munoz Marin, who upon entering the governor’s office realized that Puerto Rico could not become independent economically, after 50 years of big sugar buying up all the farm land and dislocating all the small farmers.” Rafael Antonio Ruiz Ayala, a lawyer now living in the United States, puts it bluntly. “The ELA was good for only one thing  to carry United States' luggage.”“I think that the commonwealth was a good exercise in self-determination within the historical context of its inception,” said Federico Rodriguez, a humanitarian living in Laos. “You can argue that it’s a 'colony in disguise' and that the economic policies of the U.S. curtailed its growth, fostered a culture of dependency—a welfare state, so to speak—, and created a sub-class of U.S. citizens,” he said.“At the risk of sounding ageist, I think that at 63 the commonwealth is approaching retirement. It is “exhausted” and, given its record, it’s time for it to step down and allow a new status or political structure to replace it. As our old folks often say: “Se acabó el pan de piquito.” That is the end of that.Or as Elizabeth Sabater put it: “The ELA has been in the grave a long time now.”",https://www.foxnews.com/world/after-63-years-puerto-rico-as-a-commonwealth-is-ready-for-retirement-many-say,Fox,Conservative
157,No passport? No problem! For Americans traveling to Puerto Rico it's an easy Caribbean getaway,KRISTI EATON,2016-12-31,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  Sometimes you just need a quick trip to the beach. But as an American without a passport — mine had been stolen — I had limited options for an easy but interesting getaway.I decided to try Puerto Rico. The island, which is a U.S. territory, offers for Americans all the comforts of domestic travel — easy entry, no extra charges for cell phone service, and the U.S. dollar as the currency. But Puerto Rico also has Caribbean beaches and Latin culture along with waterfalls, colonial Spanish history and good food and drink. That made it more appealing to me than a stateside beach.I convinced my first-grade pen pal to join me at the very last minute, and we spent five days relaxing on the beach, exploring old San Juan, hiking through the island's rain forest and, of course, enjoying tropical drinks as we pondered our futures.Puerto Rico has two seasons: wet and dry. Prices tend to be lower in the rainy months, April to November, but that's because you run the risk of getting stuck inside your hotel room waiting for the rain to subside. Traveling there last fall, I knew this going in, but was willing to take my chances.Take my chances I did. The first full day on the island found us in the middle of a possible hurricane that led the government to shut down alcohol sales at all restaurants for a few hours. Talk about a buzzkill.Ultimately, the ban was lifted and my friend and I were able to enjoy margaritas and pina coladas while eating mofongo, a plantain mash that can be served with meat, seafood, chicken or vegetables.The hurricane ended up passing by the island overnight, so the next day we were able to explore historic Old San Juan, which includes a National Historic Landmark district and UNESCO World Heritage sites. Christopher Columbus landed here in 1493 and Ponce de Leon founded a settlement on the island in 1508. Centuries-old waterfront forts, La Fortaleza and El Morro, were built to protect it from invasion. Puerto Rico remained a Spanish colony until 1898, when the U.S. took over following the Spanish-American War. La Fortaleza remains in use as the governor's mansion.A large gate and tunnel, Puerta de San Juan, still lead to the old city through what's left of the tall walls that once surrounded it. Pink, blue, green and yellow buildings caught our eyes as we wandered the cobblestone streets with their fountains and plazas.We also spent a day at El Yunque, Puerto Rico's famous tropical rain forest. Many visitors rent a car and make the trek on their own from San Juan — it's about 30 minutes away — but we booked a guided tour through our hotel that included a hike and swimming beneath a waterfall.

They included drawing a link between a preference for high heels and warm weather, and low heels and rural areas.Another publication drew a parallel between high heels and places where people tend to drive more from one point to another, and low heels in places, such as New York City, where women do a considerable amount of walking.Gilt, meanwhile, didn’t offer much analysis.

159,"Despite economic woes, one Puerto Rico neighborhood experiences renewal", Fox News    Fox News  Fox News,2016-12-29,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  Laura Feliciano was scouting locations for a new restaurant in the Puerto Rican capital when she discovered she was priced out of the upscale waterfront districts that were her first choice. Instead, she set up several blocks inland on a grungy street lined with discount stores and pawn shops.Feliciano named her new restaurant and bar ""Pa'l Cielo,"" a Puerto Rican saying that translates as ""To Heaven,"" but she was far from it in the Santurce neighborhood. Prostitutes and drug dealers hissed to prospective customers from darkened corners, and diners insisted on being escorted back to their cars, sometimes to find their vehicles had been broken into.Feliciano, who had returned to her native Puerto Rico from Los Angeles in search of an affordable place to open a business, almost gave up. ""We thought about closing so many times because we would have felt responsible if something happened,"" she recalled of the early years, referring to her clients' safety.But Feliciano persevered, and her patience has been rewarded.In the six years since ""Pa'l Cielo"" opened, the Santurce neighborhood has been a success story in Puerto Rico, which suffers from a 13.5 percent unemployment rate after eight years of economic recession.While tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left to seek better opportunities abroad, a few entrepreneurs like Feliciano have tried to make a go of it within San Juan. In Santurce, Feliciano's restaurant has been joined by dozens of other new businesses including cafes, vintage boutiques and a bookstore. The renaissance also features an arts festival that draws artists and tourists from around the world.Some investors in Santurce are considerably larger than Feliciano. Among the many building projects that have moved forward in recent years is a sleek glass-and-steel tower called Ciudadela, acquired by New York real estate developer Nicholas Prouty.Despite a deep slump in the island's housing market, Prouty said at a Sept. 18 news conference that all of the building's 312 units had been sold. Puerto Rico's Economic Development and Commerce Department says Prouty plans to add 252 apartments, 50,000 square feet of retail space and a public park for a $114 million expansion to the project ""in the heart of Santurce,"" a location that would not have been trumpeted in the past.Prouty says he sees promise in the neighborhood of about 100,000 people because of recently declining crime, undervalued properties and an influx of young people.""Santurce has acquired a sort of coolness, a favored spot for San Juan's new generation,"" Prouty said at the news conference. ""My partner and I saw the possibilities, immediately.""Feliciano, 39, says her ""Pa'l Cielo"" restaurant has attracted celebrities such as actor Benicio del Toro and members of the Grammy Award-winning hip-hop group Calle 13. She was so confident about the area's future that she has also opened a small Mexican eatery. ""It's still a place where people with limited means and a strong will can make it,"" she said of Santurce.The neighborhood is bounded on the north and east by the upscale Atlantic Coast districts of Condado, Ocean Park and Isla Verde, areas familiar to tourists visiting Puerto Rico. To the west lies the largely middle-class area of Miramar and the approach to picturesque Old San Juan, a colonial district of cobblestone streets and the seat of local government.The area turned to slums in the 1970s as people moved out to suburbs near San Juan. Many who stayed behind were immigrants, mostly from the Dominican Republic and often living in large blocks of public housing dominated by drug gangs amid surging crime in the 1990s. Longtime residents recall the neighborhood's deterioration with bitterness. ""Santurce was a forgotten place,"" said Juan Luis James, a 56-year-old tire repair shop owner who has lived there all his life.Today, abandoned buildings still pock the area, though many now feature vibrant murals painted as part of the arts festival called ""Santurce es ley,"" which translates as ""Santurce is the law.""Outdoor movie nights also are held in an empty lot near Feliciano's businesses in a spot named Cinema Paradiso created by filmmaker Michelle Malley Campos, 28, upon returning from New York.""There were a lot of people who told me, 'Are you crazy? It's dangerous there. Nobody's going to go,'"" she recalled with a laugh. ""Now they're eating their words.""Some people trace the neighborhood's comeback to the government-led restoration of La Placita, a plaza that features an outdoor produce market surrounded by bars and restaurants, some considered to be among the best in Puerto Rico. The area now draws thousands of people, including many tourists, to eat, drink and dance to salsa music every weekend.The transformation is far from complete. Despite occasional police roundups, sex workers wearing little more than G-strings and mesh shirts are sometimes still found along Ponce de Leon Avenue at night, a few blocks from Departmento de la Comida, a small shop and restaurant that specializes in organic arugula and other produce from the Puerto Rican countryside. The 30-year-old proprietor, Tara Rodriguez, said she doesn't mind.""It's not perfect, it's not polished,"" she said. ""And that's something I celebrate about Santurce. It has its characters, it has its flaws. There's a lot to work with here.""Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/despite-economic-woes-one-puerto-rico-neighborhood-experiences-renewal,Fox,Conservative

It's located in Vieques, an island popular with tourists just east of the main island of Puerto Rico.Environment Secretary Carmen Guerrero said Sunday that access to the bay needs to be improved to prevent sediment from getting in the waters. She said officials are evaluating designs for an upgraded road to the bay. Puerto Rico is also looking at ways to combat light pollution.Guerrero said one of the biggest challenges will be figuring out how many visitors to allow. Now, there are no limits on how many people can visit the bay.The area is currently popular for kayakers, who like to paddle through the glowing bay.The bay's bioluminescence is created by a number of factors working together: Red mangrove trees, a complete lack of modern development around the bay, the deep, cool water is cool and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay.The small channel was created by the Spanish, who believed the bioluminescence was the work of the devil, when they tried to damn the bay by dropping a boulder in its mouth.The Spanish's work only preserved the bioluminescence and increased the lights.. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/puerto-rico-plans-to-protect-bioluminescent-mosquito-bay,Fox,Conservative

163,Rum Wars: The Spat between Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands Heats Up,Ruth Samuelson    Fox NewsRuth Samuelson    Fox News  Fox News,2016-12-12,"When guests showed up at Miami restaurant Sra. Martínez on April 27, they drank and feasted on rum, rum, and more rum, all of it Puerto Rican: Aside from sipping cocktails, they noshed on treats like Bacardi-infused cupcakes and ceviche spiked with DonQ Limón.At some point, Nicole Rodríguez, who directs a government office supporting the island’s rum industry, addressed the crowd.All rum isn’t created equal, Rodriguez says she told them: “The best champagne is made in France, the best cigars in Cuba and the best rums in Puerto Rico.”These days, the island is working vigorously to push that message. And there’s a reason for that: Captain Morgan, the world’s second most popular rum (behind Bacardi), will end production in Puerto Rico this year. In late 2010, brand owner Diageo opened up a new distillery in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), and will be moving all production there. The Miami event was part of a $2 million marketing campaign to move forward following the devastating loss.“The government of Puerto Rico is very committed to limiting that damage,” says Rodríguez.For both Puerto Rico and the USVI, the Diageo switcheroo brings significant repercussions. Both jurisdictions benefit from the federal government’s “cover-over” program, which annually provides millions of dollars through rum taxes.The program works like this: The federal government imposes a $13.50 excise tax per proof-gallon on rum sold in the United States, but $13.25 of that amount is “covered-over” to the territories’ treasuries. Overall, each territory receives a cover-over sum that is roughly proportional to the amount of rum it manufactures and sells in the United States.A version of this policy dates back to 1917.Puerto Rico’s revenue always blew away the USVI’s  but then again, so did its population, nearly 4 million in contrast to 110,000 people.Between 1990 and 2008, Puerto Rico received $5.4 billion and the USVI $1.1 billion from these taxes, according to a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS).But that was before USVI made its move.Diageo announced their plans to build a USVI distillery in 2008. In a statement to The Hill, USVI Congressional delegate Donna Christensen said the change came after the company failed to come to an agreement with their Puerto Rico manufacturer and started looking at foreign locations in Central America and the Caribbean.The new contracts will raise the USVI’s cover-over revenue from $90 million to $240 million per year, said U.S. Virgin Islands Governor John P. deJongh, Jr. in a lengthy statement to Fox News Latino.Puerto Rico has painted the USVI’s deal as a government hand-out of cover-over money, in which, instead of placing tax money in public coffers, the USVI is “giving 50 percent back to the rum producer,” as Rodríguez says.DeJongh, Jr. characterized the USVI’s rum industry investment as approximately 40 percent, with 60 percent going directly to public needs.“[The contracts] will keep companies in America for at least 30 years,” he says, adding that the new money would be a boon for schools, infrastructure and the island’s pension system.USVI supporters insist that Puerto Rico has inked similar contracts, but revealed less information publicly about where the money goes  an argument Rodríguez calls “false,” adding “under Puerto Rican law, all government contracts are on file and open for public inspection.”Before Captain Morgan jumped ship, the Destilería Serrallés manufactured the brand’s base rum. Roberto Serrallés, the operation’s vice president in business development, is a sixth generation rum-maker; his family’s company dates back to at least 1865.Destilería Serrallés produces its own brands, such as Ron Llave, DonQ and Ron Palo Viejo. But Captain Morgan was “close to 75 percent of our total capacity,” says Serrallés. This year, he’s placing 30 to 40 employees  out of roughly 350  on temporary layoffs.After the Captain Morgan announcement, Puerto Rico’s congressional representative, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, introduced legislation that “would limit the territories from offering more than 10% of their covered over revenue as an industrial subsidy,” according to the CRS report.“The restriction seems intended to make it more costly for the Virgin Islands to provide incentives to rum producers currently in Puerto Rico to relocate,” the report concluded.The proposal made little progress in the last Congress, but Pierluisi is expected to present similar legislation soon.Meanwhile, Puerto Rico is fiercely focused on cementing down its current rum-makers and luring new business. In February, officials said they had brokered a deal to keep Bacardi  the world’s most popular brand of rum  on the island for the next 20 years.""We are taking swift action so that Puerto Rico avoids losing its rum industry to threats posed by unprecedented strategies that other rum-producing jurisdictions are chasing,"" José Pérez-Riera, the island’s commerce and economic development secretary, told the Associated Press.The agreement gives the brand a $95 million grant to renovate its production plant, as well as “production and marketing incentives that will equal 10 percent of the [cover-over money] from Bacardi sales in the U.S.,” the article reported.Meanwhile, Roberto Serrallés says that he is finalizing agreements with two new suppliers, both sellers in the U.S. He was also working on a super premium white rum with a celebrity partner in California.“When you’ve been around for 145 years, you’ve seen it better and you’ve seen it worse,” he says. “It’s not going to be my generation that makes [the business] stop.”Ruth Samuelson is a freelance writer living in Mexico City.

164,House Approves Puerto Rico Statehood Measure, Fox News    Fox News  Fox News,2016-12-11,"The House voted Thursday to allow Puerto Ricans to change the island’s commonwealth status, in what critics are saying is a backdoor attempt to force Puerto Ricans into choosing U.S. statehood -- something Puerto Rican voters already have rejected three times.The bill, which passed 223-169 and now must be taken up by the Senate, would introduce a two-step ballot measure for Puerto Rico to decide if its residents want to change their current relationship with the United States. If they vote to change their status, they can then choose to become a state, pursue independence, or seek some other ""political association between sovereign nations.""Click here for more on this story from our LiveShots Blog.Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said that while Puerto Rico doesn't need congressional authorization to hold such a nonbinding vote, the bill could be a game-changer -- part of a plan, he said, to give the island's progressive activists ""legitimacy"" in a push toward statehood. Chaffetz suggested it was part of an effort to bring more Democrats into Congress.""That's what some of us who understand this bill are so just frightened about,"" Chaffetz told radio and Fox News host Glenn Beck. ""The majority of people in Puerto Rico don't even necessarily want this.""Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory at the end of the Spanish-American War. Those born on the island were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917 and Puerto Rico gained commonwealth status in 1952.Today, Puerto Ricans serve in the military but can't vote in presidential elections. They do not pay federal income tax on income earned on the island.Proponents of the new measure say it gives citizens of the island the right to self-determination. Thursday's action was nonbinding, and if Puerto Ricans eventually select statehood, Congress would still have to vote to admit the island to the union as the 51st state.The issue divided Democrats and Republicans alike as liberal Democrats with ties to Puerto Rico teamed with conservative Republicans to oppose the measure.Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., whose parents were born in Puerto Rico and who represents part of Chicago, slammed the bill on the House floor Thursday morning, calling it a device to ""impose"" statehood on residents who have repeatedly rejected the idea.""Really it's designed to get one thing and one thing only, and that is to have the people of Puerto Rico accept statehood for themselves,"" he said. ""Why don't we accept their wishes? … It's spelled the same in English as in Spanish: N-O. No. No.""The divides were particularly stark among members of the House Republican leadership team. House Minority Leader John Boehner,R-Ohio, voted against the legislation. Meantime, House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence, R-Ind., voted in favor.Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno (R) cobbled together more than 50 Republican sponsors in favor of the package.But there was drama as the majority Democrats narrowly avoided an upset on the House floor.Republicans attempted to add provisions to the legislation that would have made English the official language of a potential Puerto Rican state.Republicans also tried to modify the bill by banning any infringement of the Second Amendment in Puerto Rico.The Democratic majority defeated the GOP effort, 198-194.Fox News' John Brandt and Chad Pergram and .",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-approves-puerto-rico-statehood-measure,Fox,Conservative
165,Puerto Rico Luring Major Movies, Fox News    Fox News  Fox News,2016-12-11,"Baghdad war zones. Brazilian slums. Even cookie-cutter American suburbs. They’ve all been recreated in Puerto Rico, which increasingly is becoming a backdrop in American and European cinema.Rarely does the island play itself on the silver screen. But in recent years, the territory has provided dramatic land- and seascapes for productions starring some of Hollywood's biggest names, including George Clooney and Johnny Depp.Television productions are also finding a temporary home here. HBO's dark comedy series ""Eastbound & Down"" and the Italian miniseries ""Angels and Diamonds"" recently were filmed in Puerto Rico. HBO's crime drama ""The Wire"" shot a memorable sequence in the scenic seaside slum of La Perla.""It's just got a great flavor,"" said Luis Guzmán, a New York-born actor of Puerto Rican heritage known for his work in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Traffic."" ''People who shoot for the first time on the island are pretty blown away by all the beauty.""Sure, the Caribbean island has an array of beaches, rainforest, desert-like ranges, colonial streetscapes, flashy resorts and gritty ghettoes. But Hollywood has been attracted, first and foremost, by tax incentives that are among the most generous offered by any U.S. jurisdiction.Star-struck politicians in the U.S. territory have been eager to dangle big tax breaks and other incentives in a feverish bid to lure a film industry that is being similarly courted all over the world and has grown accustomed to shopping around for the best deal.""Tax-credit programs have become the determining factor in deciding where to shoot, and ours is very aggressive,"" said Mariella Pérez Serrano, the island's film commissioner. ""The more they spend in Puerto Rico, the more they get back.""The stakes are high for Puerto Rico as the struggling U.S. territory grapples with a 16 percent unemployment rate, higher than any U.S. state. Officials hope that the film industry will boost the economy with more infusions of cash and jobs.Even though tax credits have been offered to movie makers since 1999, Puerto Rico has just started fully capitalizing on its proximity to the film industries in the U.S. mainland and Europe by aggressively marketing the credits.Film commission employees are increasingly heading to industry trade shows, where they make their pitch to studio executives, producers, directors, cinematographers and location scouts. They advertise the tropical locale as a top money-saving film destination in trade publications such as Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.It's paying off. In 2000, just one movie was shot in Puerto Rico, generating less than $1 million. In 2009, nine movies generated $57 million. So far this year, seven films have been shot and there are more in the pipeline, but confidentiality agreements with the studios prevent local officials from identifying them.Puerto Rico refunds up to 40 percent of a film studio's expenditures during a shoot, transforming movie making into one of the few bright spots in an otherwise tough local economy. To tap into the island's program, the government requires that at least 50 percent of principal photography be shot on location or $1 million has to be spent hiring local crew and contractors. Shooting on government properties is free of charge.Politicians may even sweeten the incentives package with new tax breaks for nonresident actors and makers of commercials in a bill awaiting a Senate review during next year's legislative session.Elizabeth Redleaf, producer of Todd Solondz's 2009 movie ""Life During Wartime,"" which had Puerto Rico doubling for South Florida, said the generous tax breaks motivated them to shoot on the island and work with local vendors.""That's the point of the tax credits — they act as a local economic stimulus. And with a 40 percent tax credit, we were happy to stimulate whenever we could,"" Redleaf said from her office in Minneapolis, Minnesota.In return, Hollywood studios and independent producers spend money on sets, props, caterers, and salaries for actors, extras and crew members. Movie crews visit local restaurants and spend at local businesses while shooting in town.Movie making can be a flavor-of-the-moment business, so when Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortuño signed a law last year extending the 40 percent tax credit for film productions until 2019 he stressed his government was ""committed to turn the island into one of the most important film industry destinations.""Producers praise Puerto Rico's crews and the film commission's cooperation, even if shooting in the territory comes with its own brand of logistical headaches for big studio movies and TV series. The absence of a soundstage is the biggest problem.In a tropical island long on scenic vistas but short on movie making amenities, a vacant warehouse in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo was the closest the producers of the Warner Bros. action flick ""The Losers"" could come to a soundstage.Stephanie Laing, producer for the HBO series ""Eastbound & Down,"" which had Puerto Rico doubling for Mexico, said they were ""limited with what we could build due to the lack of proper film stages with support systems.""""The biggest problems we faced had to do with the fact that Puerto Rico is still a relatively young film industry and as with all new industries there are bound to be growing pains,"" Laing said.Now with Puerto Rico experiencing a mini-boom in filmmaking — courtesy of its tax credits — the push is on to build a full-scale soundstage.Anibal Melendez, the mayor of the northeast coastal city of Fajardo, said husband-and-wife pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony hope to turn a sliver of his municipality into a movie making hotspot. Whether a soundstage will be built in Fajardo is far from certain, however, and publicists for the couple — who teamed up for a movie on Puerto Rican salsa legend Héctor Lavoe in 2006 — declined comment.Economists in Puerto Rico say luring the movie industry to Puerto Rico is helping ease the U.S. island's grinding four-year recession, but they also warn that permanent tax breaks can end up being more of a crutch than an incentive.""It is a good idea to attract stateside movie makers to the island, but our end goal should be to develop good local productions that can play around the world and make money for local talent,"" said Juan Lara, a leading economist on the island..Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/puerto-rico-luring-major-movies,Fox,Conservative

167,"As crisis deepens, Puerto Rico's statehood status increasingly subject of debate",Jan-Albert Hootsen,2016-12-08,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  When 63-year-old Mary Mojica Baldínez speaks of her “country,” she, like most Puerto Ricans, isn't referring to the nation that expedited her passport.“I am Puerto Rican and my country is Puerto Rico,” she says proudly, escaping the oppressive Caribbean heat in a lawn chair in the shadows of Santurce, a working class neighborhood in Puerto Rico's capital city.“I don't consider myself to be much of an American, even if I have that nationality and I lived there for a long time.”Such pride in her Puerto Rican identity might be expected to be followed by a raised fist and a call for independence from the United States. Her feeling on the status of the island is an altogether different matter, however.“The moment Puerto Rico gains independence I'll leave,” she told Fox News Latino. “We can't be independent, because we haven't been taught how to be.”As Puerto Rico grapples with a crushing $72 billion public debt, looming defaults, rising poverty levels and the largest exodus of its inhabitants since World War II, the island's complicated relationship with the United States is increasingly subject of debate here in San Juan.After declaring a moratorium a $422 million in bond payments last week, Puerto Rico's government is expected to default again in July on another $2 billion. The administration of Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who June last year declared the island's debt 'unpayable', is scrambling to deal with the crisis by laying off thousands of government employees and cutting spending on healthcare and education.But with almost half of its population living in poverty and some 12 percent unemployment, many Puerto Ricans have lost hope; last year alone, 70,000 packed their bags and left.Indeed, Puerto Rico's status as an unincorporated U.S. territory with self-government makes it almost impossible for the island to solve the crisis itself. It can't file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, restructure its debts or request federal bailout money. Congress in Washington D.C. will ultimately have to decide on a solution, on which it hasn't been able to agree upon so far.Moreover, Puerto Ricans lack voting representation on the Hill and can't vote in November for a new president.During a visit last week to San Juan, many inhabitants asked by FNL said they are dissatisfied with the status of Puerto Rico, likening it to a colony and lamenting its lack of sovereignty. That same week, on Thursday, the issue was raised by columnist Jorge Iván Rodríguez Feliciano in San Juan newspaper “El Nuevo Día.”In an opinion piece titled “The Shame of Being a Colony,” he called for Governor Garcia Padilla, who won't run for re-election in November, to organize a referendum on the status of the island, saying it was the “cause of the majority of the problems and inequalities we Puerto Ricans suffer.”“There's definitely a problem,” said René Vargas, a former student activist now working at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan. “I believe part of the problem has been that Congress in Washington takes decisions about rules, about specific laws that affect Puerto Rico, while Puerto Ricans have no possibility to participate in the creation of them.”This sentiment has been echoed in several polls in recent years and in the non-binding referendum held in 2012. In the latter, 54 percent of voters said they were against continuing its current territorial status.But if popular opinion were to decide, independence is not the way to go.In the referendum, little over 5 percent of voters preferred full secession from the United States. A 2013 poll by the universities of Suffolk and Turabo placed that percentage a bit higher, at 14 percent. The general tendency, even with the island having been hit by a recession for a full decade now, is against independence. Indeed, Puerto Rico's Independence Party only won 2.5 percent of votes in the 2012 elections.“We have never really gotten the idea of independence under our skin,” said José Vargas Vidot, a pro-independence activist who leads the non-governmental organization Iniciativa Comunitaria in San Juan and is running as an independent for the Puerto Rican senate in November.“We know what it means on an intellectual level, but not emotionally,” he said.But another reason few Puerto Ricans believe independence would be a viable option is the fact that the island is heavily dependent on federal funds to survive. Puerto Rico receives over $20 billion in federal finds every year and more than a third of Puerto Ricans are on food stamps.“It's that dependence on the United States that makes Puerto Ricans terrified of the idea of independence,” René Vargas, the student activist, told FNL. “We can't really take any decision without referring to Washington, to Congress, so most people here prefer to maintain the current status.”Far more traction in recent years has gained the movement to gain full statehood. In the 2012 referendum, 61 percent of voters said they preferred become the 51st state, as opposed to the 5 percent wishing independence or the little over 33 percent wanting more autonomy in a free association with the United States.But some observers say that, even if the debt crisis pushes Puerto Ricans toward overthinking their relationship with the United States, change is unlikely to happen any time soon.“The independence movement is not very popular, and I don't see the political will in Congress to grant statehood to Puerto Rico,” Juan Agosto-Alicea, who served as Puerto Rico's Secretary of Treasury between 1985 and 1989, told Fox News Latino.Agosto-Alicea himself is more partial to the idea of an autonomous Puerto Rico in a sort of free association with the U.S., but believes now is not the time to change the status of the island.“We're completely dependent on the U.S., and any kind of change should come gradually,” he said. “We should design a plan that would gradually lower the dependence of our economy on the U.S, and maybe, in 15 or 20 years, when our economy would be comparable to that of the poorest U.S. state. We could negotiate more autonomy,” he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/as-crisis-deepens-puerto-ricos-statehood-status-increasingly-subject-of-debate,Fox,Conservative
168,Opinion: COFINA deal is huge blow to dwindling appeal of Puerto Rico’s bonds,Iván Rivera,2016-12-08,"For Puerto Ricans who place the rule of law and their own Constitution in high esteem, this is a perilous time indeed. As former president of an organization that supports the political party of Governor García-Padilla, I need to stand up for our Constitution.While lawmakers must address this crisis, they must do it in a manner that will put Puerto Rico in a position to succeed over the long term — not by voiding contracts and bending to the will of COFINA creditors.Two weeks ago, Representative Sean Duffy officially introduced the “Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability,” or PROMESA, which was largely drafted by, and will be marked up in, the House Committee on Natural Resources.As many feared it would, the bill allows the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico itself to declare bankruptcy. Significantly, if Puerto Rico itself can declare bankruptcy, then it can cast aside the protections and seniority with which it sold bonds to investors retroactively. In practical terms, this means tearing up the Puerto Rican Constitution.Curiously, however, one of the most vocal cheerleaders for this bill is actually a group of Wall Street hedge funds that owns debts issued under the “Puerto Rican Sales Tax Financing Corporation,” commonly referred to as COFINA.COFINA was a creation of Wall Street financial whizzes Goldman Sachs and counts large billion dollars hedge funds like Goldentree Asset Management, Whitebox Advisers and Baupost Group as bondholders.   It’s important to take a step back and ask why COFINA was created in the first place. In 2006, the island was in desperate need of money, but unable to issue debt because it had run up against its constitutional debt limit. In desperation, the island’s government created a sales tax revenue bond as a way for Puerto Rico to issue new bonds that would not count against the 15 percent limit on “full faith and credit” debt. Fast forward to late April 2016.During the Natural Resources Committee’s hearing on the legislation, a lawyer representing COFINA’s hedge funds claimed his clients are negotiating with the island to secure a deal whereby they would take a small cut to ensure that they are paid ahead of the island’s other creditors when a restructuring agreement is reached. The lawyer extolled the merits of this plan, which he claimed would give Puerto Rico billions in additional liquidity, and which, presumably, would be negotiated between the hedge funds and the Puerto Rican government in accordance with the PROMESA framework. So what exactly is their plan? First, they would accelerate payments to the COFINA creditors. Second, their plan would create a new debt structure that the island would be forced to use exclusively; it would prohibit the island from issuing new debts outside of this new structure. This would deal a huge blow to the already dwindling attractiveness of Puerto Rico’s various outstanding bonds, except those COFINA bonds that would be on an accelerated payment schedule. Once PROMESA goes into effect, COFINA’s hedge funds will likely also argue that their investments are exempt from the restructuring mechanism because of their dedicated tax revenue stream. This is an argument that they have maintained in attempts to position themselves as the island’s most sacrosanct tier of debt, despite the constitutionally-dubious nature of COFINA’s creation and the fact that other bonds enjoy more explicit protections. This argument, combined with their accelerated payment schedule, will allow a chosen few hedge funds to sell the bonds that they bought for pennies on the dollar at a very substantial profit. In other words, COFINA’s hedge funds win and all other bondholders, who account for 80 percent of the island’s debt, lose. What’s so sad about this situation is that COFINA was created with a dubious agenda in the first place, and Congress, specifically Speaker Ryan, believes that setting up a sweet deal for this group  at the expense of all other stakeholders, including local Puerto Rican bondholders  is the right path forward.   While lawmakers must address this crisis, they must do it in a manner that will put Puerto Rico in a position to succeed over the long term — not by voiding contracts and bending to the will of COFINA creditors. Only a solution that is equitable to all stakeholders and abides by the island’s constitutional framework can offer both relief and the promise of sustained growth into the future.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/opinion-cofina-deal-is-huge-blow-to-dwindling-appeal-of-puerto-ricos-bonds,Fox,Conservative
169,"Amid economic disrepair, doctors flee Puerto Rico leaving patients without care", Fox News    Fox News  Fox News,2016-12-03," SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  Wanda Serrano arrived at Puerto Rico's largest public hospital before dawn to take her 17-year-old son to an appointment. Six hours later, they were still in the packed waiting room hoping to see a doctor.They had gone to San Juan's Centro Medico to see one of the many kinds of specialists the teen needs for treatment of a genetic disease called tuberous sclerosis, which can cause tumors to grow on his brain, kidneys and other organs. But specialized medical expertise is increasingly difficult to find in the economically troubled U.S. island territory.Six hours in a waiting room is no longer the exception, but the norm. A pediatric neurologist recently told Serrano that her son, Cedrik, needed to wait 10 months for an appointment.""I live terrified every single day,"" Serrano said one recent morning as she clutched his medical records and peered anxiously down a fluorescent-lit hallway for a nurse or doctor. ""You feel powerless. You can't do anything except wait for that date to arrive.""Doctors have gradually left Puerto Rico during a decade-long recession that has gripped the island and driven more than 200,000 people to the U.S. mainland seeking better opportunities.Now, the steady departure of pediatricians, surgeons, orthopedists, neurologists and others has become a stampede as the economy shows no sign of improving and financial problems in the territorial health insurance program make it nearly impossible for doctors to stay in business.Up to 700 doctors are expected to leave Puerto Rico this year, double the number from two years ago, said Dr. Victor Ramos, president of the island's Association of Surgeons. The territory's number of doctors has dropped from 14,000 to 9,000 in the past decade, the majority leaving for higher salaries and lower living costs on the U.S. mainland.The island of 3.5 million people now has only two pediatric urologists, one orthopedist specializing in ankle and feet, one pediatric cardiologist, and a handful of geneticists and endocrinologists. It can take a year to see a specialist, Ramos said.""People are waiting much longer for appointments, including one that could be a matter of life or death because there is simply no room,"" he said.Dr. Hiram Luigi, an orthopedic surgeon, said he has to realign the bones of patients a couple of times each month because they did not see a specialist in time.""I have spent 30 years in orthopedics, and I have never seen something like this,"" Luigi said.The lack of specialists has adversely affected patients, whose health conditions often worsen before a doctor sees them.Many people like Serrano have moved to the U.S. specifically to get medical care. ""I'm searching for quality of life,"" she said.Puerto Rico's financial woes are largely to blame. The government is behind on insurance payments as it scrambles to make payments on debts that have ballooned in recent years to nearly $70 billion. Doctors not only struggle with delayed reimbursements for services but receive less money through the government's Medicare and Medicaid programs as well as private health insurance than they would for the same services on the U.S. mainland.Many specialists no longer accept patients with Medicaid, which covers roughly half of Puerto Rico's population. The great majority of patients like Serrano's son now seek specialists at Puerto Rico's largest public hospital, lining up as early as 1 a.m. daily for medical care.""It's truly the final stop for many people,"" said Edgar Colon, dean of the University of Puerto Rico's School of Medicine. ""We can't keep up.""The hospital is buckling under a surge of patients as it operates with a dwindling budget, unable to buy certain medical supplies like it used to when the government could still borrow money.Jorge Vidal, president-elect of Puerto Rico's Radiology Association, said he cannot perform some procedures because he can't obtain two types of specialized needles.""There's a very simple reason they haven't bought them,"" he said. ""They cost $300.""Such problems pushed pediatrician Dr. Hector Nieves to move to Florida in February 2015. In his new office, the answering machine offers same-day appointments.""I don't regret leaving,"" Nieves said. ""Puerto Rico's problems are much bigger than people think.""Those who have stayed say it will only get worse.More than 20 percent of the island population is 60 years and older, and that percentage is expected to spike as not only doctors but all types of Puerto Ricans leave for the U.S. mainland.Serrano and her son will move soon to Orlando to join her husband, who found a job there. She is optimistic about finding specialists to provide the checkups her son needs every six months.""I'm leaving in peace,"" she said.

170,Puerto Rico bill creating control board to restructure $70M debt clears first hurdle, Fox News    Fox News  Fox News,2016-12-01,"WASHINGTON (AP)   A bipartisan deal to help Puerto Rico manage its crippling finances cleared its first hurdle Wednesday with approval from a Republican-led House committee.The bill to create a financial control board and restructure some of the U.S. territory's $70 billion debt has support from House Republican and Democratic leaders, as well as the Obama administration. But some bondholders, unions and island officials have opposed it.The House Natural Resources Committee approved the legislation 29-10.""We have a constitutional, political and moral imperative to act,"" said committee chairman Rob Bishop, the Utah Republican who has led negotiations on the bill. The legislation now moves to the House floor.The legislation won support from Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, who said people on the island fear for their finances and their future.""Accepting a board is personally painful, but it is also the right and necessary thing to do,"" said Pierluisi, who is running for governor.The island's current governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has been less enthusiastic. He said after the vote that the bill contains important elements to address the island's insolvency issues, grow the economy and ensure continuity of essential services. But he also said the seven-member board would be too powerful and could undermine the territorial government.""Our democratic rights need to be equal to those of other U.S. citizens who live in the United States, and the board's provisions do not meet that obligation,"" Garcia said.Bishop introduced the bill May 18 after weeks of negotiations that involved House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. Pelosi has endorsed the legislation, and Lew called it a ""fair, but tough bipartisan compromise.""Ryan, R-Wis., has worked to unite his fractured caucus behind the bill, arguing that the legislation would avoid an eventual taxpayer bailout.The Senate hasn't yet acted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the chamber is waiting for the House to move first.Puerto Rico, which has struggled to overcome a lengthy recession, has missed several payments to creditors and faces a $2 billion installment on July 1. Two government agencies have been under a state of emergency, and the economic crisis has forced businesses to close, driven up the employment rate and sparked an exodus of hundreds of thousands of people to the U.S. mainland. Schools lack electricity and some hospitals have said they can't provide adequate drugs or care.But like U.S. states, Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy. The legislation would allow the control board to oversee negotiations with creditors and the courts over reducing some debt.It would also require the territory to create a fiscal plan. Among other requirements, the plan would have to provide ""adequate"" funds for public pensions, which the government has underfunded by more than $40 billion.During negotiations, the Obama administration pushed to ensure that pensions are protected in the bill, while creditors worried they would take a back seat to the pension obligations. Bishop says the control board is designed to ensure all are paid.While some bondholders have backed the legislation, others have lobbied forcefully against it.""If passed, this bill will serve as a landmark moment in American municipal finance — the moment when Congress made clear that it will not hesitate to rewrite rules and override contracts so that bondholders are forced to foot the bill for the pension systems that negligent governments have bled dry and refused outright to fund,"" the Main Street Bondholders Coalition said in a statement released before the committee vote.Republicans who voted against the bill echoed those concerns and said the legislation could set a precedent for financially ailing states. Rep. Tom McClintock of California, a Republican on the committee, offered an amendment that would have exempted some bonds from the bill.""If Congress is willing to undermine a commonwealth's constitutionally guaranteed bonds today, there is every reason to believe it would be willing to undermine state guarantees tomorrow,"" McClintock said.The amendment was rejected, 27-12.The legislation survived several other attempts to try and derail it, including additional amendments by Republicans that would have explicitly protected certain bondholders and allowed bondholder lawsuits to continue.Most Democrats on the committee supported the bill, though they tried to remove a provision that would allow the governor of Puerto Rico to cut the minimum wage temporarily for some younger workers. Unions have also lobbied against the legislation for that reason.Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said this week that the board would neglect the needs of ordinary Puerto Ricans.""We must stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the American citizens of Puerto Rico with the respect and dignity that they deserve,"" he said.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-bill-creating-control-board-to-restructure-70m-debt-clears-first-hurdle,Fox,Conservative
209,The solution for Puerto Rico’s enviable WBC shortstop pickle,Joel Sherman,2016-11-16,"When I saw Alex Cora last month during the NLCS, I asked him about a terrific dilemma he faced. The Cubs’ Javier Baez and Indians’ Francisco Lindor were breakout stars of the postseason and heading toward a World Series showdown. They also were not far from playing on the same team. But the Astros’ Carlos Correa was set to be on Team Puerto Rico for the WBC, as well. So who is going to play shortstop: “Good question,” said a laughing Cora, who is the GM for the Puerto Rican team. “Stay tuned.” He joked, “When Cleveland shifted I saw [Lindor] make a play at second base and I told him he looks like Robby Alomar.” Cora noted at the time that he had hoped his choice for the infield would be made more difficult and that Colorado’s Nolan Arenado would play third base, but he knew by then that the American team wanted and would get Arenado to play for the U.S. squad. Since then, Cora – the longtime major league infielder – was named the Astros’ bench coach, so he could decide to make his life easier by just having, say, Correa play short, Lindor second and Baez third. Another Houston star, George Springer, also is expected to play for Puerto Rico as is Carlos Beltran. One interesting name that Cora mentioned likely to play for his team is the Mets’ Seth Lugo, who Cora said has Puerto Rican heritage on his father’s side of the family.

""Statehood will provide equality to the people of Puerto Rico.""Rossello recently told The Associated Press that as governor he would draft a state constitution, hold elections to choose two senators and five representatives to Congress and send them to Washington to demand statehood, a strategy used by Tennessee to join the union in the 18th century.Rossello's win throws into question the future of the party led by Bernier, who has acknowledged that Puerto Rico's commonwealth status — on which his party was built — is no longer viable.""We fought a hard and intense battle,"" Bernier said as he conceded defeat. ""It's a very difficult moment for the history of this party.""Bernier was hurt by anger over the economy, a corruption scandal involving his Popular Democratic Party and the emergence of two independent candidates who appealed to an increasing number of voters.Gov.

210,Hedge funds begin to sue over Puerto Rico debt,Carleton English,2016-07-25,"Hedge funds are gathering forces to collect their claims on Puerto Rico’s debt. Since the beginning of the year, there have been at least seven lawsuits filed against Puerto Rico’s government by the island’s various creditors, according to a recent Bloomberg report. Of the lawsuits identified, two were filed within the last month by a consortium of hedge funds that includes Aurelius Capital Management, Autonomy Capital, and Monarch Alternative Capital. The hedge funds focused their claims on a portion of Puerto Rico’s $18.3 billion in outstanding general obligation and commonwealth-guaranteed bonds. Collectively, the bonds are secured by all available resources of Puerto Rico and the “good faith, credit, and taxing power” of the island. On July 1 President Obama signed the PROMESA bill, which allows Puerto Rico to restructure its $72 billion debt load. The hedge funds allege that within hours of being enacted, Puerto Rico purposely defaulted on the bonds in favor of “lower-priority obligations” which diverted “resources to politically preferred purposes.” This was “clearly illegal under both the [Puerto Rican] Constitution and PROMESA” as well as being “unnecessary,” say court documents.

That would affect the ability to issue flood warnings and as well as the monitoring of water quality, aquifer levels and drinking water supplies.The stations also are used for environmental research and provide data for water use, flood planning and climate change.""It's a serious problem,"" Rafael Rodriguez, director of the USGS Caribbean-Florida Water Science Center, said in a phone interview. ""The water quality network is being eliminated in its entirety.""Puerto Rico's Environmental Quality Board and 12 other local agencies are required by law to pay USGS 65 percent of the cost of operating the stations. However, the agencies have accumulated $2 million in debt in the past year, Rodriguez said.He said the USGS has offered local officials a payment plan and proposals to lower the agencies' yearly contributions, but officials have not responded. A spokesperson for the Environmental Quality Board could not be immediately reached for comment.More than 100 other stations would remain operational, but they are limited in scope and used exclusively by Puerto Rico's power agency and its water and sewer company, Rodriguez said.It is the second time this week that Puerto Rico's debt has affected services.

211,Everyone should cheer the rescue of Puerto Rico,Post Editorial Board,2016-06-09,"Congress is poised to pass the bipartisan bill to restructure Puerto Rico’s $72 billion debt — a sign that Washington can move in an emergency. The emergency measure has the backing of President Obama and congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. In other words, liberals and conservatives compromised to serve the needs of 3.6 million US citizens. PROMESA, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, may not be perfect, but it’s a rational response to the island’s crisis. It provides for debt restructuring — not a taxpayer bailout — to let Puerto Rico recover from its crisis. It does not grant Chapter 9 bankruptcy powers — which aren’t available to states, either. And it leaves the island’s elected governor and Legislature in charge of Puerto Rico’s budget-making process. Unless, that is, they fail to reduce the debt to a sustainable level. At that point, a new seven-member federal control board, with members largely appointed by Congress, can impose an alternate plan. That’s a bitter pill — but an acceptable response to the mismanagement that got Puerto Rico into this mess. New York City got stuck with its own control board after it nearly went bankrupt in the 1970s — and it worked. The Puerto Rican rescue also sets up a congressional task force to report on barriers to the island’s economic growth caused by federal laws and regulations. That could be a huge help: Congress’ decision decades ago to impose the federal minimum wage on Puerto Rico wound up devastating many of the island’s traditional industries. As House Speaker Paul Ryan said, “PROMESA is the best chance for creditors to get paid, for Puerto Rico to get on the right track and — most importantly — for American taxpayers to be protected.” By the way, mainlanders shouldn’t feel too smug about Puerto Rico’s woes: Not far down the line, this legislation may have to provide a template for federal rescues of states like New Jersey, Connecticut and Illinois.

213,Hedge funds want Puerto Rico to borrow more cash,Josh Kosman,2016-04-21,"Some hedge fund investors in Puerto Rico’s debt, staring at the possibility they will be forced to take a severe haircut as part of a reorganization of the territory, have recently floated a novel plan: Have the island’s government borrow even more money, The Post has learned. Several funds that  own Puerto Rico’s general obligation (GO) bonds are telling members of Congress they want to exchange their debt for newly issued bonds, sources close to the situation told The Post — even though Puerto Rico can’t pay its present $72 billion in debt. The proposal would result in the funds retaining more of their profits than they would if Congress allowed Puerto Rico access to a court-supervised reorganization — but is still a risk for House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is trying to craft a bill Republicans, Democrats and creditors can support. The clock is ticking. Puerto Rico is facing a May 1 debt payment it can’t afford to make. Ryan wants to present legislation to Congress next week, sources said. The GO bondholders want Congress to create a “control board” to sell $6 billion in bonds backed by an existing petroleum tax. The lenders would exchange some of their debt, now trading at 60 cents, for new bonds they believe would trade at more than 80 cents, one source said. What Puerto Rico would get from the deal is a lower interest rate, around 5 percent, compared with the 8.7 percent it pays now, and a later maturity, the source said. The control board would have the right to reduce most of the 13 different classes of debt but not the GO bonds. “A partial cram-down is a compromise,” said a source close to the GO bondholders. The Obama administration has been pushing for the right to impair all creditors, so Puerto Rico can reduce its debt and get more breathing room. That would never pass muster with the conservative Republican wing, so Ryan is in a tight space — pressing to see how far he can push a bill and not lose that conservative support.

215,Helping Puerto Rico may start a whole new wave of bailouts,Betsy McCaughey,2016-03-22,"If you have a retirement fund or pension, or you’re a taxpayer, get ready to have your pockets picked. The Obama administration wants Congress to enact a bankruptcy plan for Puerto Rico, forcing holders of Puerto Rican debt (including New York City pension funds) to settle for less than they’re owed. Puerto Rico is over $70 billion in debt and already defaulting. House Speaker Paul Ryan has promised action by March 31, and the Supreme Court took up the issue on Tuesday. In 1984, Congress amended federal bankruptcy law to prohibit Puerto Rico from enacting any law that would force creditors to accept less than what they’re owed. If Congress rewrites the rules now retroactively, it will jolt municipal-bond markets. Jittery lenders will demand higher interest from states and cities that need to borrow, whacking taxpayers who foot the bill. Bankruptcy’s not the answer. Congress needs to show Puerto Rico some tough love, by imposing a board to oversee the island’s finances, curb its profligate spending and cut its bloated government payroll. Puerto Rico’s pols have flunked civics. The island is mired in cronyism and corruption. Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) calls a control board a “colonial power grab.” Nonsense. A control board turned around New York City in the 1970s and the District of Columbia in the 1990s, without resorting to bankruptcy. Allowing the island to weasel out of its debts will encourage more irresponsibility. Last Christmas, Puerto Rico’s governor doled out $120 million in bonuses to employees, just before defaulting on millions in debt. Puerto Rico’s publicly owned utility is $9 billion in debt, but still provides free electricity to 78 municipalities, keeping local pols happy, and even powers an ice-skating rink in the tropical heat. Yet on Tuesday, the utility pleaded with the Supreme Court justices to be allowed to stiff its creditors. Predictably, the Obama administration supports allowing Puerto Rico to default, telling Paul Ryan a bankruptcy would “cost taxpayers nothing.” If you believe that, I have some Puerto Rican bonds to sell you. Even liberals like New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. blasted Obama’s proposal, saying it would hurt the value of the city’s pensions and “by extension the retirement security of New York City workers.” Ditto for retirees and investors nationwide. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) warns against Obama’s plan. Investors will realize that if Congress can erase Puerto Rico’s debt, “they can do that for California and Illinois and New York,” leading to a “rapid escalation of borrowing costs for states.” And their taxpayers. On the legal front, Puerto Rico’s lawless politicians didn’t wait for a congressional bailout. In 2014, the debt-mired island passed its own local bankruptcy law — now being challenged in the Supreme Court. Puerto Rico wanted to help its electric utility escape paying its debts in full. Trouble is, the US Constitution and federal law both prohibit that. The Constitution’s framers barred local governments from passing bankruptcy laws, reserving that power for Congress alone. After all, if local politicians could rewrite the rules and erase debts, who would ever loan money? Ignoring the Constitution, Puerto Rico passed its law anyway. What chutzpah. But the utility’s creditors challenged it in federal court, and have won each step along the way. It’s amazing that the Supreme Court is even hearing an appeal on this. Even worse, during oral arguments Tuesday, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor seemed sympathetic to this lawless act. With Justice Antonin Scalia deceased and Justice Samuel Alito recusing himself, the island has a shot at a 4-3 victory. It would be a defeat for the rule of law. In 2013, President Obama pushed Congress to avoid a national debt default, insisting “we’re not some banana republic . . . We don’t run out on our tab.” Why is that behavior suddenly acceptable for Puerto Rico?

216,Scalia’s death may hurt Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring plans,Josh Kosman,2016-03-18,"Antonin Scalia’s death makes it less likely that Puerto Rico gets the legal authority to restructure its own debt, two sources in the case told The Post. Up to now, most opinions held the opposite view — that the island territory’s chances of restructuring its $72 billion in loans improved when the respected justice, a strong believer in the sanctity of contracts, died on Feb. 13. But Scalia was an equal champion of Puerto Rico sovereignty, the two sources said, and could have teamed with Justice Sonia Sotomayor to push the court to allow Puerto Rico to file bankruptcy to reorganize its crippling debt load. “Scalia seemed to be very much in favor of Puerto Rico sovereignty,” a source said. “I think his notion of fundamental fairness was eclipsing federalism.” The justice’s questions in a Puerto Rico sovereignty case earlier this year led the source to believe Scalia was sympathetic to the territory’s view. A hearing before the Supreme Court on the debt restructuring is scheduled for March 22. The territory doesn’t have the money to repay its debt, and its 3.5 million citizens are feeling the squeeze. Just seven justices will hear the case, as Justice Samuel Alito, with investments in Puerto Rico, recused himself last year. To be sure, Puerto Rico’s chances of gaining the right to file bankruptcy are still high, some say, expecting the four liberal justices on the court — Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer — to vote in favor of Puerto Rico. A lower appellate court ruled against Puerto Rico. Many legal scholars have instead been quoted as believing Scalia’s death has improved Puerto Rico’s odds of getting the right to file bankruptcy. “Scalia has been a fairly aggressive defender of contractual rights over the years,” Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson told Reuters. Hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital has submitted briefs in the case against Puerto Rico. Other municipal bond investors, which include Oppenheimer and Franklin Templeton, want to be paid in full and are fighting Puerto Rico’s attempt to reduce its debt through the Recovery Act. The high court is expected to rule on the matter in June. Puerto Rico is in negotiations with the various creditor groups, but it appears unlikely any deal will be reached before the Supreme Court opinion, sources said.

217,Marco Rubio takes Puerto Rico primary,Marisa Schultz,2016-03-06,"WASHINGTON – Marco Rubio picked up ​a win in Puerto Rico Sunday, giving his faltering presidential campaign a much needed jolt of life. The Florida senator scooped up all of Puerto Rico’s 23 delegates because ​he ​easily garnered more than 50 percent of the vote on the Caribbean island. It’s just the second win for Rubio, after Minnesota. He’s struggled to pick delegates and victories in the shadow of Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, both of whom have both called on Rubio to end his GOP bid for the White House. With all precincts reporting, Rubio had 73.8 percent of the vote, followed by Trump (13.6 percent), Cruz (9 percent) and John Kasich (1.4 percent), CNN reports. Rubio’s next make-or-break test is his home state of Florida – with a strong contingent of Puerto Ricans — where he could pick all of its 99 delegates on March 15. Rubio spent Saturday night campaigning in San Juan where he delivered a stump speech in Spanish. Soon after the race was called, Rubio’s campaign started soliciting donations. “Rubio Blows Away Competition in Puerto Rico,” one fundraising email began. Rubio still trails badly in the delegate count. Trump has 384 delegates; Cruz has 300 and Rubio has 151 delegates. About 6,000 prisoners in Puerto Rico cast absentee ballots Friday, a significant number in the territory where 30,000 Republican voters were expected to turn out Sunday. Only Vermont and Maine also allow inmates to vote. ",https://nypost.com/2016/03/06/marco-rubio-takes-puerto-rico-primary/,New York Post,Conservative
218,John Paulson will encourage investments in Puerto Rico,Josh Kosman,2016-02-10,"Hedge fund mogul John Paulson is traveling to Puerto Rico on Thursday to speak at an investment conference. He’d better pack a sweater — he could face a chilly reception. Paulson, who has invested millions of dollars in buying up several luxury hotels on the cash-strapped island over the past several years, will play cheerleader for investing in the commonwealth by serving as the keynote speaker at the Puerto Rico Investment Summit at the Puerto Rico Convention Center. “He will be there talking about the value of investing in Puerto Rico,” a source familiar with the conference said. “He’s trying to attract capital to Puerto Rico.” While the temperature outside the convention hall is expected to rise into the 80s, Paulson might not get as warm a welcome from prospective investors — especially the hedge fund executives who are peeved at the moves proposed by Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla to restructure $70 billion in debt. The governor’s proposal calls for stiff haircuts on payouts on various bonds. On some sales-tax-backed bonds, he has proposed paying 54 cents on the dollar. Some of those bondholders on Wednesday countered his proposal by offering a plan that would pay them 100 cents. In light of the battle over how much bondholders will be paid, trying to sell other investors on pumping more money into the island’s assets is an uphill fight, sources said. “Why would someone invest in Puerto Rico when they are going to default on federally constituted debt?” one source said. Paulson does not own any of Puerto Rico’s debt, sources said. The billionaire is a big believer in investments in Puerto Rico. In September 2013, Paulson & Co. bought a controlling interest in the exclusive St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort as well as the Bahia Beach Resort & Golf Club. Paulson is building a home for himself on Bahia Beach, the master-planned community that he now owns — and that’s situated on 483 acres of pristine coconut palms . In March 2014, Paulson added to his Puerto Rican exposure by spending $260 million to buy two hotels: the Condado Vanderbilt and the La Concha Renaissance Hotel and Tower. And then this past July, Paulson spent $20 million to buy the San Juan Beach Hotel. In August 2014, he bought the 326,000-square-foot American International Plaza building in the Hato Rey financial district. His properties would benefit if more hedge funds invested in PR. Since making his name and a personal $3.7 billion by betting against the housing market, Paulson has struggled in some of his other gambits. The 60-year-old has made incorrect investments on energy, gold and Europe’s economy. His funds now have roughly $18 billion of assets under management, falling from $40 billion five years ago. Paulson declined to comment. ",https://nypost.com/2016/02/10/john-paulson-will-encourage-investments-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
219,Richard Ravitch under fire for signing on to help Puerto Rico,Josh Kosman,2016-02-05,"Richard Ravitch — the go-to guy for cash-strapped municipalities — is taking some heat for volunteering to help Puerto Rico recover from its debt crisis. Ravitch, who helped save New York in the 1970s and more recently Detroit from total financial ruin, is advising the troubled Caribbean island on a pro-bono basis. In December, he told a Senate committee that the teetering US territory should get congressional authority to declare bankruptcy. Puerto Rico doesn’t have the money to repay its $72 billion of debt. And unlike a US city, it can’t seek relief by filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection without congressional approval. Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor of New York, sits on the board of Build America Mutual (BAM), one of only three firms that insure municipal bonds — and the only one without exposure to Puerto Rico. The largest muni bond issuer, Assured Guaranty, is suggesting Ravitch is biased and bent on helping BAM. “Given his background and years of experience, and his position on the board of directors at BAM, it would be surprising if he were unaware that BAM would likely benefit competitively if Puerto Rico’s position on bankruptcy prevailed,” an Assured Guaranty spokesman said. Ravitch told The Post, “I don’t believe Build America will benefit” from a Puerto Rico bankruptcy. He said the island’s governor has asked for his opinion, and he has given free advice. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy could benefit BAM because it would make municipal bond issuance much more profitable. “Municipalities [if their credit ratings fell] would buy more insurance to lower their borrowing costs,” he said.

220,"City lawyers, consultants cash in on Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy","Isabel Vincent, Melissa Klein",2016-01-31,"New York lawyers, consultants and publicists stand to rake in more than $100 million in fees as Puerto Rico struggles to stay afloat. The commonwealth’s $72 billion debt crisis has been a boon for well-connected companies like MillCo Advisors, a financial-restructuring firm, which stands to gain as much as $52.4 million. Jim Millstein, who heads MillCo, is a former official of the US Treasury Department. Puerto Rico also has contracts with Manhattan law firms Cleary Gottlieb and Proskauer Rose that max out at $37 million and $6.6 million, respectively, according to government records and contracts reviewed by The Post. Another Manhattan law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, is nickel-and-diming ­Puerto Rico, charging for catering and 16 cents per page for photocopying, according to its contract, which shows it stands to make up to $4.6 million. Despite all the high-powered help, Puerto Rico defaulted on debt payments this month, the second time it has done so, and US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew this month said the commonwealth was “in the midst of an economic collapse.” Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla has said he will pay municipal workers over the commonwealth’s own constitutional obligation to pay its debt. “The fact that the Puerto Rican debt crisis resulted from years of over-spending, political cronyism and outright corruption goes a long way to explain why Puerto Rico’s political leaders have poured many millions of dollars into a small group of politically connected legal, lobbying and consulting firms,” said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, a Virginia watchdog. SKDKnickerbocker, the powerful Manhattan communications and public-affairs firm, was retained by Puerto Rico to handle public relations and marketing at a cost of up to $3.4 million, including $500,000 for advertising. Influential lobbyist Jennifer Cunningham is the point person in six of the seven Knickerbocker contracts with Puerto Rico, records show. Cunningham, pal to Gov. Cuomo and former wife of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, is a former honcho with SEIU Local 1199, the giant health-care-workers union based in Manhattan. Some of Puerto Rico’s contracts with Knickerbocker, like with other firms, were amended and the payment caps increased. The contract ­totals were confirmed by Puerto Rico’s Office of the Comptroller. Yet Knickerbocker VP Barbara Morgan, speaking also for MillCo, Cleary Gottlieb and the Puerto Rican government, insisted to The Post that the contract figures listed on the comptroller’s Web site were inaccurate. “The documents referenced do not reflect the payments made to these firms; they only represent the potential costs of the contracts,” said Morgan, former spokeswoman for Rep. Anthony Weiner’s mayoral race. Morgan issued a statement defending the hiring of the consultants. On Jan. 16, she said the statement came from Puerto Rico Secretary of State Víctor Suárez; and on Jan. 22, she attributed the same statement, with four words changed, to Grace Santana, chief of staff to the governor. The other firms refused to comment or refused to discuss payments. The commonwealth has been suffering from a sagging economy after a tax break expired and is facing massive debt.

174,"Puerto Rico's Debt Crisis: We can't reward fiscal failure with a bailout, bankruptcy",Peter Ferrara,2016-01-18,"Puerto Rico is an island of 3.5 million people that owes $73 billion in government debt. Last week, Puerto Rico started defaulting on at least part of that debt, missing $37 million in payments due, and indicating more missed payments to come.Not widely enough understood is why this is America’s problem. Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, governed under American law, including the Constitution, which applies there. Its people are American citizens, free to travel anywhere in the United States. Puerto Rico is to the U.S. what Greece is to the EU.The root of the problem is Puerto Rico’s economy, which no longer reflects the island’s name. Only 40 percent of the adult population is even in the workforce, with about a third working for the government, paid by the Island’s taxpayers. With 12.5% unemployment, the Island’s population is declining, down 5% in the last 5 years. Those leaving are the most productive professionals, taking their incomes and tax payments with them.Under U.S. law, cities and towns can file for bankruptcy, but states and territories cannot. Yet, special legislation enacted by Congress in 1984 denied bankruptcy for Puerto Rico’s municipal governments, agencies and bureaus, as well as for the entire Island’s government. Moreover, all of the Island’s government bonds are exempt from U.S. taxation. Counterproductively, these two factors made lending to Puerto Rico’s government at low interest rates intensely attractive for U.S. lenders.Conservatives and Republicans cannot support a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico. That would just reward fiscal profligacy and failure. Such a bailout would become a model for every liberal, overspending city in America to avoid overdue policy reforms and paying back its debt. The politics of the 2008 Wall Street bailouts were murder for Republicans, and they cannot go anywhere near that again.The Obama sdministration has proposed addressing the problem through emergency Congressional legislation creating a special “territorial bankruptcy regime,” which would protect the Island from lawsuits to collect its debts, which have already begun. But that is the opposite of the way out, making the problem worse rather than better.Puerto Rico’s debt is over three times greater than Detroit’s, so bankruptcy would be even more complex and expensive than that litigation, which dragged on for years and cost the city $178 million in professional fees. Worse, that litigation became an excuse for avoiding any of the policy and structural reforms necessary for Detroit’s economy to grow out of bankruptcy.Pension costs were the single largest line item in Detroit’s budget. But the bankruptcy litigation failed to reduce those costs at all, while cutting bond debts by 90%. City bureaucracies   avoided virtually all recommended cost efficiencies, including adjustments to infrastructure planning to reflect the two-thirds decline in Detroit’s population. The city’s 28 agencies continued virtually undisturbed.Moreover, Puerto Rico’s loans were made under the promise of no bankruptcy. Rewriting those rules after the fact would set another precedent for doing the same any time for any part of the entire $3.6 trillion U.S. municipal bond market. That would raise borrowing costs for all cities and towns across America.What is needed are structural reforms that would restore rapid economic growth to Puerto Rico’s economy. Instead of disrespecting the rule of law with after the fact bankruptcy, Puerto Rico can collaboratively enter renegotiations with lenders outside of bankruptcy, as it has already been doing. Instead of discouraging essential capital investment on the Island, that would encourage and promote such investment.To aid this, Congress can pass a package of pro-growth legislation for Puerto Rico. That would provide for immediate expensing for all capital investment on the Island, elimination of Jones Act requirements for use of U.S. flagged vessels for transport to the island, and suspension or reduction of the federal minimum wage law on the island, which substantially increases unemployment. That legislation should also suspend excessive EPA overregulation on the Island, which would require Island government authorities to borrow billions more in the next couple of years, for rebuilding compliance that would counterproductively raise energy costs on the Island sharply.Puerto Rico can also adopt complementary pro-growth reforms. The entire welfare system needs to be reformed around a work requirement, like the federal welfare reform of 1996, so the extensive welfare assistance will stop discouraging workforce participation. Business regulation needs to be reformed and streamlined to encourage more new business startups. Labor regulation needs to be reformed to encourage more flexibility in work force management. With economic growth on the Island revived, and more workers working, revenues would surge, while spending demand for public assistance will decline. That will enable the government to service its debt, under renegotiated terms.This is a Puerto Rico debt plan with real promise to work. If President Obama won’t cooperate in enacting it, he and his party will bear the political liability.      ",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/puerto-ricos-debt-crisis-we-cant-reward-fiscal-failure-with-a-bailout-bankruptcy,Fox,Conservative
175,Wave of public school closures in Puerto Rico highlights deepening economic crisis,,2015-12-12,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Francisco Oller Elementary School once bustled with kids, but now birds nest in classrooms strewn with leaves and glass from shattered fluorescent lights. Long-discarded homework assignments paper the ground. Graffiti covers the walls.Located in a city just outside San Juan, the school is among more than 150 shuttered in the last five years as a worsening economic crisis has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to move to the U.S. mainland over the past decade.Driven by a combination of budget cuts and declining enrollment, the loss of so many schools is having a profound impact on communities in the U.S. island territory, forcing many children to commute to new campuses and creating a blight in places already hard-hit by recession.The government says the situation could get much worse. It warned just days ago that by early 2016 it may run out of money to pay its bills, and over the next five years it may have to close nearly 600of the 1,460 public schools that once existed to save $249 million a year. Currently, there are 1,387 schools across the island.The trend ""speaks volumes about how we're losing population, about how we're not being efficient in building the island's future, about how we're losing opportunities to create citizens,"" said San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz. ""I'm extremely concerned this will increase the hopelessness and mistrust that the island has in itself and lead people to think that the only option to succeed and support their families is to leave the island.""Puerto Rico has seen school enrollment drop 42 percent in the past three decades, and an additional 22 percent drop is expected over the next five years, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, which signed a multimillion-dollar deal with the government to help restructure the island's education system. Much of the drop is the result of parents moving to the mainland U.S. in search of better opportunities, including many teachers being recruited from the island for their bilingual skills.Among the tens of thousands of people who left last year was 27-year-old Devis Gonzalez, who moved his family to Orlando, Florida, after finding a job as a truck driver.""The reason was plain and simple: work,"" he said. ""Like everyone else, we were looking for a better quality of life.""His young son attended a school in a rural area of Puerto Rico's central mountain range that teachers say is among dozens expected to close permanently this summer, raising concerns that some children might have to travel a half-hour by bus to the nearest school.Nina Craig, a biologist from Ontario, Canada, who lives in the north coastal municipality of Arecibo and whose son attends school there, said the countryside is being stripped of services.""I think it's inappropriate to be closing schools in the country just because they have a smaller population,"" said Craig, who owns a farm in Arecibo, her husband's hometown. ""We can't just all of us move to the city or all of us be commuting to the city.""The closures have also hit urban areas. The Francisco Oller school, named after a Puerto Rican impressionist painter, closed in 2010, reopened its doors for part of 2012 to receive children from another school that was being remodeled, then was abandoned for good. People in an adjacent working-class neighborhood complain that the empty school has been vandalized and is now being used as a shelter by drug addicts, a scene repeated around the island.Many criticize the government's handling of the closures, including Sen. Mari Tere Gonzalez, president of the Senate's education commission.She said officials did not take transportation logistics and special education needs into account. The Boston Consulting Group noted that 30 percent of Puerto Rico students receive specialized education, twice the average in the U.S. mainland.""We have to condemn the way in which it was done,"" Gonzalez said. ""Our duty is to make sure that the rights of students aren't being affected when it comes to services.""Education Secretary Rafael Roman did not respond to requests for an interview. He has said the exodus of nearly 45,000 Puerto Ricans a year and the island's low birth rate will keep driving down enrollment. The island has seen its population dwindle to 3.5 million people, with nearly 411,000 students attending public schools. Roman's department has not said which schools it will close next, angering parents and school officials who note that enrollment for the upcoming school year ended in March.""All of us parents are in limbo,"" said Rafael Feliciano, a former teachers union president who now leads a group fighting the closures. ""They are taking these measures behind our backs ... It's a disgrace.""In the meantime, the government is putting some of the closed schools up for sale on a real estate website. The listing for the Francisco Oller school says it would be a good location for commercial businesses, medical offices or even a new school.City officials say the asking price is $1.8 million.So far, there are no takers.___Danica Coto on Twitter: www.twitter.com/danicacoto",https://www.foxnews.com/world/wave-of-public-school-closures-in-puerto-rico-highlights-deepening-economic-crisis,Fox,Conservative
176,Haiti migrants braving sea in rickety boats add Puerto Rico as way station trying to reach US,,2015-12-08,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Haitians have fled their troubled country for years, attempting to reach the U.S. or other Caribbean islands by heading north across the open sea or trekking across the island of Hispaniola to scratch out a living in the Dominican Republic.But a newly popular route has caught officials in the Caribbean by surprise, one that is taking migrants to a piece of the U.S. much closer to home.Hundreds of Haitian migrants have made their way to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in recent months, finding that if they can make it there without getting arrested, it's relatively easy to fly on to U.S. cities such as Miami, Boston or New York without even having to show a passport.""As soon as you're in Puerto Rico, it's like you're in the United States,"" said Lolo Sterne, coordinator for Haiti's Office of Migration.There are no official statistics on how many Haitians have successfully made their way illegally to Puerto Rico, or how many have traveled on to the U.S. mainland. But the trend worries officials in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic, with both countries reporting a jump in arrests of Puerto Rico-bound Haitians.Migrants reportedly are paying smugglers $1,000-$1,500 for a trip to Puerto Rico, located less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the island of Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. At the same time, Dominican officials have detained more than 400 Haitians bound for Puerto Rico in the past four months, compared with just a handful annually in previous years, said Victor Pilier, the Dominican Republic's director of naval intelligence.""It's an excessive amount,"" said Pilier, who oversaw the capture of 78 Haitians headed to Puerto Rico in late April before sending them back home. ""It's unusual.""U.S. officials in the past six months captured 352 Haitian migrants who were bound for Puerto Rico or were found on or near the island. Coast Guard statistics show that between October 2010 and September 2011, only 13 such migrants were found, and at most five Puerto Rico-bound Haitians were arrested in the two years before that.""We're seeing another route they're trying to exploit,"" said Coast Guard Capt. Drew Pearson, who is based in Puerto Rico. ""We hadn't seen these numbers of Haitians in my tenure here.""The odds of reaching the U.S. mainland directly from Haiti have dropped as the U.S. Coast Guard beefs up patrols by Hamilton class cutters, or what Haitian migrants simply refer to as ""Amilton."" Along with trying to sail directly to the U.S. mainland, Haitians in the past attempted to get to the United States through long-established smuggling networks on islands including the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.""Miami is no longer easy to reach and that's why Haitians are looking for other places,"" said Walky Severian, a boat builder in western Haiti who himself has taken three voyages, including one in 2008 that ended up in Cuba because of stormy weather before he was deported.Pilier, the Dominican naval officer, said migrant smuggling to the U.S. territory has also become common because Dominican authorities have a harder time patrolling the nation's southeast coast, which is closer to Puerto Rico and where many smugglers have started launching from.""We have a stronger presence in the north,"" he said. ""The east is more vulnerable.""On top of that, a thriving underground economy in Puerto Rico that has long offered employment to Dominicans is now attracting Haitians.For Haitians hoping to get to the U.S. mainland, the island of 3.7 million people has a black market that supplies fake passports, driver's licenses and stolen Social Security numbers. In addition, the island's governor in early March endorsed a proposal to allow immigrants living illegally in the U.S. territory to apply for a provisional driver's license. Pilier said that proposal has in fact drawn many migrants to Puerto Rico.In March, U.S. federal officials rescued 71 Haitian migrants stranded on a cluster of islands just west of Puerto Rico, dehydrated and with bruises and scratches. The rescue came a week after 67 migrants from Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic were found in the same cluster of islands, including a Haitian woman who died.On the black-sand beach in the fishing village of Leogane west of the Haitian capital, groups of men build wooden migrant boats, sawing and hacking away with machetes and picks. The 30-foot-long boats, whose frames resemble the rib cage of a small dinosaur, are purchased by smugglers for around $12,000 and then taken to northern Haiti to find passengers. One boat builder said he has four or five regular customers who buy the crafts.Many Haitian farmers lost their crops during last year's hurricane season, causing food supplies to drop and prices to rise in a country of 10 million people that is still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake.The number of Haitians who don't have enough to eat to maintain a healthy diet has grown from 1.9 million at the end of 2009 to 6.7 million today, said Myrta Kaulard, the country's director for the United Nations' World Food Program.""Migration is a very important coping mechanism,"" she said.Nasere Severian, a 48-year-old boat builder, himself took three unsuccessful trips to Miami in the 1990s when political instability in Haiti drove out-migration to a peak of 37,618 in 1992, according to U.S. Coast Guard data.""Sometimes we build two or three boats a year,"" Severian said. ""At the same time we can go a year without getting a customer.""Then Severian offered this: ""If it were easier to reach Miami I would try to go there every day — even if that means I die.""In another major migration trend, Brazil also has become an increasingly common destination for Haitians since the 2010 quake. The South American nation initially opened its doors to Haitians seeking asylum, then later said it would issue 1,200 visas annually to allow them to work there for a five-year period. More than 4,000 Haitians have moved to Brazil, both legally and illegally, since the disaster.Etienne Brutus, a 26-year-old unemployed father of three, was among the 78 Haitian migrants caught leaving the Dominican Republic last month, en route to Puerto Rico.He spoke in Spanish to The Associated Press by telephone while sitting on a bus full of migrants traveling from the Dominican Republic's southeast coast to the capital of Santo Domingo for processing before being driven back to Haiti. Dominican authorities provided an AP reporter with the cell number of a naval officer, who then passed the phone to Brutus. But the signal was weak, making it impossible to obtain more than a few details about his situation.Brutus said that when he approached smugglers about leaving Haiti, they told him they weren't traveling north, and that their only destination was east to Puerto Rico. He agreed to make the trip, and crossed into the Dominican Republic for the sea voyage.""I don't have work, I don't have a room, I'm hungry,"" he said of his life in Haiti. ""If I can get to Puerto Rico, amen. If I can get a room, a job and papers, I'm leaving.""___AP writers Danica Coto reported from San Juan, and Trenton Daniel reported from Port-au-Prince and Leogane, Haiti.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/haiti-migrants-braving-sea-in-rickety-boats-add-puerto-rico-as-way-station-trying-to-reach-us,Fox,Conservative
221,Breaking down Miguel Cotto-Canelo Alvarez: a Puerto Rico-Mexico battle,George Willis,2015-11-20,"It was supposed to be a fight for the WBC middleweight championship and still is, sort of. But what really is at stake Saturday night in Las Vegas when Miguel Angel Cotto and Saul “Canelo” Alvarez meet in a scheduled 12-round HBO pay-per-view ($59.95) bout is the pride of two countries passionate about boxing. Cotto already has earned a place in his nation’s storied boxing legacy by becoming the first Puerto Rican to win a world title in four different weight classes. At age 35, he is padding a resume that is already worthy of Hall of Fame consideration. Cotto (40-4, 33 KOs) would be defending the WBC middleweight title he earned by beating Sergio Martinez in June 2014 at Madison Square Garden, but Cotto was stripped of that title this week for reportedly refusing to pay the $300,000 sanctioning fee. “I don’t need a belt to fight Canelo,” Cotto said. Alvarez, who paid the fee, will be awarded the belt if he wins. He’ll also earn the signature victory of a career that has made him a superstar in Mexico, but still needs validating to be considered among the pound-for-pound best. A third-round knockout of an out-of-shape and desperate James Kirkland last May in Houston looked impressive, but he also suffered a one-sided loss to Floyd Mayweather in September 2014 and was lucky to get a split decision victory over Erislandy Lara in July 2014. A victory over Cotto would erase any lingering doubts about just how good he is and uphold the honor of Mexico. “Obviously, it’s a fight with a lot of responsibility and I’m up for it,” Alvarez said. “I’m looking forward to it because I know it can go down in history as one of the great fights between Mexico and Puerto Rico. My career is far from over. I have many more fights to come, but this is one I’ve been craving and wanting so bad.” Cotto is hoping to continue his rebirth under trainer Freddie Roach. After consecutive losses to Mayweather and Austin Trout, Cotto teamed with Roach and is 3-0 with three straight stoppages. “Freddie brings his best to every day and every session,” Cotto said. “The least I can do is bring my best, too. I think the chemistry between us grows every day.” Roach said he isn’t impressed with Alvarez (45-1-1, 32 KOs). “Canelo’s defense is terrible,” Roach said. “He follows you wherever you go. He’s like a robot. If you use angles on him, he will be lost. He cannot make adjustments well.” Normally, Roach is quick to predict his fighter will win by stoppage. Not in this case. “We are going to box a lot in this fight,” Roach said. “We’re not just going out there looking for a knockout. I don’t want him doing that. I want him using his foot speed and his angles. He’s a more complete fighter now than ever.” While the bout is being billed as a middleweight showdown, the fighters agreed to a catch-weight at 155, which is only a pound over the 154-pound junior middleweight title. The WBC had designated the winner to face mandatory challenger Gennady Golovkin, who holds the WBO, IBF and IBO titles. But it’s doubtful either Alvarez or Cotto will be facing the rugged Golovkin anytime soon. Roach said he knows what he’d like to see next. “I would love for Miguel to win this fight by knockout, call out Mayweather and then end his career,” the Hall of Fame trainer said. “Miguel always tells me that if he had me in his corner when he fought Mayweather he would have knocked him out. He tells me that story all the time. I think Miguel could pull off the strategy I have to beat Mayweather. I think that would be a good fight for him. I think I could put Miguel in a very aggressive mode.” Cotto by decision. His experience and overall boxing skills will help him withstand Alvarez’s youth and aggression.

222,Little-known hedgie plays hardball with Puerto Rico’s debt,Michelle Celarier,2015-11-14,"As Puerto Rico careens toward a major default on its $70 billion debt load, one hedge fund mogul is emerging as a stumbling block to any deal with creditors. No, it’s not renowned “holdout” Paul Singer, who isn’t involved in the Island. The main hurdle for Puerto Rico is Mark Brodsky, a former bankruptcy lawyer who in 2004 left Singer’s Elliott Management after 10 years to strike out on his own. Brodsky’s firm, the $4.5 billion Aurelius Capital, is one of several hedge funds that own Puerto Rico’s general obligations bonds and are due an interest payment of $267 million on Dec. 1 — a debt Puerto Rico said it can’t pay. This week, Moody’s Investors Service said default is likely. While no official talks have been held, the island commonwealth has said it wants bondholders to take losses or exchange their debt for new bonds that pay a lower interest rate and carry a longer payout period. So far, Brodsky is less than bowled over by the idea, several sources said. “He’s digging in his heels and refusing to compromise,” said a person close to the informal discussions that have taken place among creditors. Word to Puerto Rico officials: Get ready for a protracted fight. When Brodsky teamed up with his ally Singer as investors in Argentine debt, it was Aurelius who was the most stubborn holdout — not Singer, who got most of the headlines, sources said. In September, Brodsky was at it again — trying to block a restructuring deal between Ukraine and its bondholders, according to individuals involved in the talks, who said Brodsky ended up cutting a side deal to get paid back 100 cents on the dollar. Over the next 16 days (and beyond), Aurelius is expected to be just as sharp a thorn in Puerto Rico’s side. Aurelius owns a big chunk of Puerto Rico’s $12 billion in general obligation debt — part of its overall debt load. The creditors have been meeting in recent weeks to try to find common ground on concessions they can agree on in upcoming negotiations with Puerto Rico. But Aurelius hasn’t been in the creditor meetings, sources said. In fact, Aurelius’ posture is one of the reasons the so-called Ad Hoc Group of Puerto Rican creditors — to which it belonged — recently broke up after many of the funds realized that lobbying for full payment wasn’t going to work, these sources told The Post. “It’s one thing to have a claim, and it’s another thing to expect to get that,” said one hedge fund manager regarding Aurelius’ take- no-prisoners attitude. In recent weeks, the Treasury Department has asked Congress to intervene by passing a bankruptcy law for Puerto Rico. Such a change is unlikely to happen — at least not before the commonwealth runs out of money, sources said. Unlike Singer’s $27 billion Elliott Management, which has also become a major activist player in the stock market, Aurelius is a much smaller fund that is solely focused on distressed debt. That may be one reason for Brodsky’s intransigence, investors say. He’s also having a bad year. Aurelius had lost 3 percent this year through October, according to investors. Brodsky did not return calls for comment. ",https://nypost.com/2015/11/14/little-known-hedgie-plays-hardball-with-puerto-ricos-debt/,New York Post,Conservative
223,Blame the progressive ‘vultures’ for Puerto Rico’s woes,Post Editorial Board,2015-11-09,"Demonize someone else for the disasters your ideas have caused — that’s the progressive “solution.” Case in point: Mayor de Blasio’s slam of “vulture hedge-funders” for fueling Puerto Rico’s debt woes. The commonwealth’s crisis is “being created by hedge-fund managers . . . trying to take advantage” of Puerto Ricans, de Blasio said Friday. He blasted lenders for “trying to make a profit” off the island’s “financial danger.” Uh, would you lend to Puerto Rico if you couldn’t make money on the deal? Progressives like City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have resorted to the same “vultures” slur. None will own up to Puerto Rico’s real problem: an economy that’s shrunk every year since 2007 — where just 40 percent of adults work or are seeking jobs, and more than a quarter of workers get government paychecks.
Nor to the pain imposed by the too-high minimum wage Congress long ago imposed on Puerto Rico. As a share of per-capita income, the federal minimum wage is nearly three times as high on the island as on the mainland. That leaves tourist businesses (a key part of the economy) lagging their Caribbean competitors. Nor will they ever note that Puerto Rico grew too dependent on now-lost federal subsidies. Or blame the island’s bloated government, which has used debt to finance its overspending (just what got Gotham in trouble in the ’70s). The real culprits, in short, are all progressive dreams: ever-higher minimum wages, government subsidies, fat-laden budgets. . . Instead, they target the “vulture” lenders whose money has (so far) helped Puerto Rico stave off financial doom.
That’s the progressive prescription for Puerto Rico: Slap the only folks offering any aid, ignore the real problems — and don’t care that you’re not really helping one bit. ",https://nypost.com/2015/11/09/blame-the-progressive-vultures-for-puerto-ricos-woes/,New York Post,Conservative

177,Lessons learned from traveling with baby on Puerto Rico trip,,2015-11-05,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  We were in paradise, surrounded by lush trees and waterfalls in El Yunque rainforest.But the pint-sized traveler on my husband's back was more concerned about our dwindling Goldfish supply than the marvels around us.""Look, Hunt, a waterfall!"" I pointed. He responded by touching his pinched fingertips together and saying, ""More, more, more.""I slipped him another cracker and repeated our mantra that this trip would be good for him.Seventeen months after my first son was born, my husband and I were itching to go abroad. We love travel and experiencing new cultures. And because we hope to instill that love in our offspring, we decided to bring him along.Some friends and family were perplexed. ""You know he won't remember it, right?"" they asked.Sure, we knew. But we also knew that what kids experience shapes their brains and futures, whether they remember those experiences or not.And we knew we'd miss the bugger like crazy if we left him behind.So we set some parameters. We wanted a spot that was affordable, wouldn't be a nightmare to fly to with a toddler, had plenty of kid-friendly attractions and would expose him to another language.Puerto Rico fit the bill.Our passports are colored with trips abroad, but we quickly realized we had to toss out all we thought we knew about traveling.We were no longer a (somewhat) low-maintenance duo, sharing two carry-ons and one checked bag. No, this was a four carry-on, two-checked bag endeavor, plus a gate-checked kid carrier.Necessities from previous trips — like laptops and pro photo gear — were nixed to make room for baby supplies like swim diapers. For photos and surfing the Web, we used our iPhones.As with parenting in general, we prepared well on some fronts, but flubbed others altogether.Things we did right:— We brought things to keep the tyke busy on the plane and beyond: books, crayons, paper and even annoying noisemakers we'd cursed relatives for giving us but which ultimately proved invaluable.— We researched San Juan well enough to know that a stroller would be a pain. We opted instead to bring a hiking-style child carrier. This made our jaunt through the rainforest easy and it was a great conversation-starter with locals. One woman literally stopped traffic to tell us how cool she thought it was.— We got a two-room suite. It cost $50 more a night and felt strange for me — my first trips abroad were hostel-hopping budget fests. But having two rooms let us keep Hunt on his normal sleep schedule, while letting us talk, read and more between his bedtime and ours.— We stuck with his nap schedule, too, by tackling one outing in the morning, then returning to the hotel for a noon break before going back out. That limited our itinerary, but we knew skipped naps would be a hell we preferred not to endure.— We did things that weren't kid-friendly like San Juan's historic forts and the Arecibo Observatory, just as we would have without him. We walked miles a day to see how people on the island live, and we shopped at a farmers market. When Hunt got impatient, one of us broke away with him and let the other finish the experience.Things we did wrong:— We broke our don't-disrupt-the-baby's-routine rule by booking a late flight on the way home, and, oh, did we pay for it. While we managed to mostly shield fellow travelers from our anguish, my husband ended up with a shiner from a tiny, flailing fist during one particularly potent tantrum.— We didn't ask the hotel about noisy scheduled events. Big mistake. We loved our hotel, but didn't love the bar-style thumping on our second night.— We occasionally expected our toddler not to be a toddler. We never overtly lost our cool when, say, Hunt threw himself on the ground for no apparent reason as we went to show him his first view of the ocean, but we did catch ourselves snapping at each other from the stress. What it taught us: Time-outs are good for adults, too.But once he reached that beach, his eyes widened, his jaw dropped and he was more ecstatic than I'd ever seen him. He rushed to the water's edge and stopped to let the waves lap his little feet, then reached willingly - for the first time ever - for my hand to guide him. I'd been studying Spanish for the trip, so when another little boy approached with toys, I was able to ask in Spanish if my son could play with him. The two played in the sand with no language barrier — toddlers don't need words to understand meaning.I don't know if the trip was as good for Hunt as I'd hoped. But one thing is certain: It was good for me.",https://www.foxnews.com/travel/lessons-learned-from-traveling-with-baby-on-puerto-rico-trip,Fox,Conservative

Wait, I can sense your hesitancy. Is it because of the quirkiness of the number? Because I refuse to sit here and listen to any hate speech about “51,” you rabid anti-semiprime-ite! ShutterstockOr … maybe it’s because you don’t think the Caribbean island’s star will fit in the already over-crowded bluey recess that is Old Glory’s canton. Well, we could always just hide it in one of the stripes. Better yet, just replace South Dakota’s star with it. No one will care. Done and done. Oh, I see. This is about money. Sure, Puerto Rico’s on the verge of filing for bankruptcy. But is there anything more American than being broke right now?

227,Critics call on top Treasury adviser to exit Puerto Rico talks,Michelle Celarier,2015-09-24,"Former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss, who became a key adviser to US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew after opponents fought his nomination to an official post, is running into more resistance advising on Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. A coalition of liberal activists sent a letter to Weiss on Thursday suggesting his Wall Street ties present a conflict of interest and he should recuse himself from the debt negotiations. Until last year, Weiss was head of investment banking at Lazard, which has a history of advising Puerto Rico on its municipal debt. That debt has now mushroomed to $73 billion, which the island’s governor said it can’t pay. Lazard also advised US hedge funds to snap up the debt and has invested in some of the hedge funds that did so, according to the activists, led by Hedge Clippers and Rootstrikers, which target the moneyed elite. Hedge funds including Blue Mountain, headed by former JPMorgan banker Andrew Feldstein, are battling Puerto Rico in the courts and fighting the commonwealth’s efforts to see US bankruptcy law extend to Puerto Rico. “Given Lazard’s ties to the Puerto Rican debt crisis, your recusal is necessary to preserve the appearance of neutrality in Treasury’s actions,” according to the letter. Coalition Letter to Antonio Weiss  Weiss withdrew his nomination as Treasury undersecretary earlier this year after liberal opponents, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said his years as a Wall Street dealmaker made him unsuitable for the job. Weiss’s $21 million golden parachute from Lazard and his involvement in the Burger-King Tim Horton tax inversion deal also fueled opposition to his nomination, according to the activists. Lew brought him aboard anyway but as a key adviser on domestic finance issues, including Puerto Rico’s debt woes. “It’s outrageous for him to lead the Treasury’s response to the crisis he helped manufacture,” said Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente.org, a Latino organization that is part of the coalition. A Treasury official declined to comment on the letter. But President Obama has backed Lew in stating publicly that Puerto Rico should be included in the US bankruptcy law. “By granting Puerto Rico access to an orderly bankruptcy regime as soon as possible, Congress can help put Puerto Rico — and the millions of US citizens who live there — on the best path to a sustained recovery,” the Treasury secretary said in a recent letter to Congress.

Practically, there’s a strong connection, financially, there’s a strong connection. “Your problems really are New York’s problems,” he added. The governor noted that health care accounts for 20 percent of the island’s economy and offered to send experts to Puerto Rico to show how New York has cut costs for Medicaid and Medicare. “Helping Puerto Rico resolve its current crisis is both morally and fiscally important for New York City,” said Puerto Rico-born Assemblyman Marcos Crespo (D-Bronx), who is part of the governor’s entourage.

229,"To save Puerto Rico from bankruptcy, face the facts",Jorge San Miguel,2015-08-31,"Amid the hype of Puerto Rico’s economic challenges, some lawmakers and special interests are lobbying for extreme measures, like Chapter 9 bankruptcy, to purportedly help the island’s recovery. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, for example, last week endorsed the idea, saying “it could help facilitate an orderly restructuring of their debt which is probably going to turn out to be necessary.” That’s a mistake. A bankruptcy by Chapter 9 or otherwise will permanently harm the island by damaging its credibility with investors and raising the cost of borrowing. Chapter 9 focuses solely on debt, not the policies and structural issues that Puerto Rico knows it must correct to improve public services and economic growth. Chapter 9 kicks the can, which is in part the cause of Puerto Rico’s challenges. Bankruptcy also guarantees years of very costly litigation, further credit instability and no public or private investment on the island. That’s exactly the opposite of what Puerto Rico needs and can afford. For any solution to be effective, it must help regain private investment and restore economic credibility. Fortunately, there are common-sense solutions at hand. For example, Puerto Rico can expand its Public Private Partnerships (known locally as P3). Since enacting its P3 legislation in 2009, Puerto Rico successfully completed transactions for toll roads, schools and an airport that collectively eliminated billions of dollars of debt and future spending. P3s offer the government the ability to privatize public assets. This eliminates the day-to-day costs of operation while improving local services and infrastructure. There remain significant opportunities for future P3s that could collectively eliminate up to a quarter of their debt. These include other roads, airports, seaports and utilities. Privatizing just the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority would eliminate $15 billion of government debt alone. Puerto Rico can also improve tax collection. The island’s sales-tax collection rate is roughly 56 percent, which is well below the average mainland rate of 83 percent. Even a modest improvement could produce annual revenues of half a billion dollars or more. The island must also cut the red tape strangling development. The World Bank Group ranks Puerto Rico 158th out of 189 economies in permitting and construction regulations. It takes six years to get all the permits necessary to start a large-scale development. And just getting a standard construction permit can take six months. Anyone can see there is room for improvement. Best of all, it can be achieved quickly via executive orders from the governor. The government can also reform how it buys goods and services. Right now it isn’t centralized, transparent or competitive, which means the government pays more than it should. In 2011, legislation was passed to modernize the process, but it was never implemented. It should be implemented immediately; even a small improvement could save over $1 billion annually. The point is, there are clear short-term steps that Puerto Rico can take with immediate long-term benefits. These alone are worth over $3 billion in new revenues and savings requiring no legislation, bailout, debt restructuring or Chapter 9. New Yorkers have a stake in Puerto Rico’s future and avoiding Chapter 9. City pension funds are invested there. City Comptroller Scott Stringer and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. recently said: “We cannot advocate for a change in law that could adversely affect the value of the pension holdings, and, by extension, the retirement security of New York City workers.” And no one has more at stake than those who live, work and pay taxes in Puerto Rico. Ours is not a crisis, but an opportunity to develop needed reforms to better serve our taxpayers, help our most vulnerable, ignite economic growth and meet the government’s obligations with “investors,” which include hardworking Puerto Ricans that have their life savings in local credit unions. It’s a question of will, not of ways. Puerto Rico has the wherewithal, we just need to get it done. Jorge San Miguel is a capital member of the law firm Ferraiuoli LLC in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he is chair of the firm’s Energy and Environmental Law Practice Groups.

230,Puerto Rico’s debt crisis might lead to US hedge fund tensions,Michelle Celarier,2015-07-27,"The first domino in Puerto Rico’s $72 billion debt drama could fall on Aug. 1. The island commonwealth doesn’t have the cash to make a a $58 million payment on Public Finance Corp. bonds due that day, the chief of staff for Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla warned Monday. Last month, Padilla said Puerto Rico’s debt is “not payable,”and the commonwealth has been in heated talks with powerful US investors about restructuring its obligations. But it appears that some debts are more payable than others, which could lead to tension between local bondholders and US hedge funds and mutual funds. “Puerto Rico is strategically choosing the PFC bonds for a default because they have almost no legal protection to force payment,” said Puerto Rican bond expert Cate Long.
“They want to start a bondholder war,” she added. On the other hand, powerful US investors, including at least 36 hedge funds and some big mutual funds, are likely to get paid. One group of US hedge funds owns bonds issued by the Government Development Bank, which make up 47 percent of the island’s debt. Victor Suarez, the governor’s chief of staff, said Puerto Rico will do “everything possible” to make a payment for the GDB, which is scheduled to make a $169.6 million interest payment on Aug. 1, according to Reuters.

231,How US wage laws helped sink Puerto Rico’s economy,Charles Lane,2015-07-11,"Greece is dominating the headlines, but between that financial catastrophe and the one facing Puerto Rico, the latter probably deserves more attention in the United States — at least more attention than it’s getting. The Puerto Rican predicament results in large part from policy mistakes by the federal government — with directly relevant lessons for the economic debate on the mainland. Take the minimum wage. Progressives around the country are campaigning to raise it to $15 an hour — more than double the current $7.25 minimum and even higher than the $10.10 supported by President Obama. Advocates confidently assert that this huge increase in the price of labor could be imposed with no significant job-killing impact, or at least that any such consequences would be outweighed by reductions in income inequality. Puerto Rico’s economic ruin, however, is partly a story of the damage an ill-considered minimum-wage hike can do. Prior to 1974, Congress held Puerto Rico’s minimum wage below that of the mainland, a sensible policy given the commonwealth’s lower level of economic development and labor productivity. Then, with the best of intentions, lawmakers ordered Puerto Rico to equalize its rate with the federal figure; this was phased in by 1983, and the Puerto Rican minimum wage has moved in lock-step with the federal minimum ever since. The results were sharply disruptive, according to a 1992 National Bureau of Economic Research analysis. They included “substantially reduced employment on the island” and mass migration of suddenly unemployable lower-skilled workers to the US mainland. Puerto Rico did post a short-term increase in real earnings, but the causal factor was the out-migration, which shrank the labor supply. Without the exodus, the authors noted, “it would have been virtually impossible to impose the US-level minimum on the island.” Today, a full-time job at the minimum wage of $7.25 pays 77 percent of Puerto Rico’s per capita income, compared with 28 percent in the United States. High prices for low-skilled labor kill employers’ incentive to invest and create jobs, especially in the labor-intensive tourism sector, which faces stiff competition from the hotels and resorts of lower-wage Caribbean islands. A 2012 World Bank study found that the minimum wage, relative to the value added per worker, is nearly twice as high in Puerto Rico as it is in the Bahamas and Jamaica. In short, the minimum wage is a major reason for what a newly published report by two former and one current International Monetary Fund economists calls “the single most telling statistic in Puerto Rico”: Only 40 percent of the adult population on the island is employed or looking for a job — versus a US labor force participation rate of 63 percent. Of course, many Puerto Ricans work for less than the minimum — in the black-market economy, which is untaxed. In other words, the minimum wage also helps explain Puerto Rico’s lack of revenue with which to service its debt. Puerto Rico’s dysfunctional labor market is not only due to the relatively high minimum wage. Also killing the demand for, and supply of, labor are the island’s onerous overtime, paid-vacation and job-security regulations. And even at the minimum wage, full-time work in Puerto Rico pays less than the combined package of welfare, Medicaid and food stamp benefits for which a family of three might qualify. Taken together, these factors result in “massive underutilization of labor, foregone output and waning competitiveness,” the IMF economists’ report concludes. If progressives have their way, however, US rules on overtime, sick leave and the rest would become more like Puerto Rico’s. A $15 per hour minimum wage, if adopted nationwide, would mean that full-time work at the minimum wage would pay roughly 65 percent of 2014 US annual per capita income — more than double the current ratio and only 12 percentage points lower than in Puerto Rico. The point is not that the minimum wage should be abolished or the labor market immune to incremental regulation. Indeed, the US economy is much more productive than Puerto Rico’s, so it could probably absorb modest, gradual minimum wage increases. Still, the island’s experience with the minimum wage and other labor-market regulations is an instructive tale, the clear moral of which is to proceed with caution.

178,Washington’s Role in Puerto Rico’s Mess,Nicole Kaeding,2015-07-02,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced this week that the small island territory would be unable to repay its $70 billion in outstanding debt. The commonwealth is in its tenth year of a depression and is losing its tax base as thousands of residents relocate to the mainland for better economic opportunities.The Puerto Rican government, which has spent wildly, is principally at fault for the crisis. But Washington, D.C. deserves a large portion of the blame for Puerto Rico’s mess.Flawed policies from Washington have aided Puerto Rico’s descent into fiscal insolvency in a number of ways. Washington inflated the island’s transportation costs, destroyed the island’s labor market with an abnormally-high minimum wage and lavish entitlement programs, and pushed flawed tax policy that created an economic bubble.Islands have higher-than-normal transportation costs due to their remote locations, but a pre-New Deal era law drives up the cost even more for Puerto Rico. The Jones Act decrees that goods being shipped between U.S. ports must be on U.S. chartered ships with a U.S. crew. That means goods coming from the mainland can’t come on the most cost-competitive vessel. They must go with one of four U.S. shippers operating that route. The limited competition increases costs. Puerto Rico’s shipping costs are twice those of its island neighbors, making items more expensive to purchase on the island. It also limits Puerto Rico’s ability to export its products to the mainland.The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour applies on the island. The minimum wage’s effects are well-known, but it has disproportionate influence in Puerto Rico. The island’s median income is only 40 percent of the mainland. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Rico residents earn $8.50 an hour or less, compared to 3 percent on the mainland. So the minimum wage greater impact in Puerto Rico. It would be like if the mainland had a $19 an hour minimum wage. The high minimum wage raises the cost of employment and prices many employers out of the market, causing unemployment to rise and thus tax revenue to dry up.  The minimum wage is a partly why the island’s unemployment rate is almost three times that of the mainland.The minimum wage is coupled with lavish entitlement benefits. A household of three in Puerto Rico can earn $1,700 a month in benefits from Medicaid, food stamps, utility subsidies, and aid for dependent children, compared to $1,150 a month in take-home benefits from the minimum wage. Individuals are better off not working, and many chose that option. Only 40 percent of Puerto Rico residents are employed or looking for work, compared to 63 percent on the mainland.Finally, Washington fueled the Puerto Rico bubble with inconsistent tax policy. Per Congress, Puerto Rican municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxation—like other states—but they are also exempt from state and local taxes too. Triple tax exempt bonds are a great investment. That attracted buyers to the bond market, allowing Puerto Rico to issue billions and billions in debt cheaply, and postpone spending restraint.In 1976 Congress allowed U.S. corporations with subsidiaries in U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, to avoid federal taxation on dividend payments to the parent company. In essence, U.S. firms could relocate large portions of their business to Puerto Rico to avoid federal taxation. As expected, many firms took advantage and the island’s economy grew rapidly, but nothing lasts forever. In the mid-1990’s, Congress and President Clinton phased out this provision over a ten year period. Firms closed up shop on the island and moved. Puerto Rico’s 10 year depression began in 2006, the first year after tax preference ended.Puerto Rico’s inability to limit spending, reform its protectionist labor laws, and institute broad pro-growth tax reform all contribute to its precarious debt situation. But it isn’t alone. Bad policies from Washington have made the pain much worse.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/washingtons-role-in-puerto-ricos-mess,Fox,Conservative
232,Puerto Rico’s bonds take a dive day after debt revelations,Kevin Dugan,2015-06-29,"Wall Street’s masters of the universe are at the mercy of a tropical island 1,600 miles away. Puerto Rico’s bonds plummeted on Monday after the commonwealth’s governor said that its $72 billion in debts were “not payable” — bringing to light the few options that investors have to collect on the money they lent to the US territory. During the last eight years, Puerto Rico has binged on debt in order to pay for infrastructure projects — everything from the expansion of commuter trains to convention centers — that ran over-budget and were under-attended and poorly managed, said Robert Donahue, a managing director at Municipal Market Analytics, which does research on public debt. But in some cases, Puerto Rico “was using [its] mortgage to pay for groceries,” Donahue said. The territory’s $3.5 billion bond offering last year, which dropped 11.4 percent on Monday, to 68.75 cents on the dollar, was used to pay off money it owed to its government development bank, bond data show. Short of a loan from the federal government — an unlikely situation, experts say — Puerto Rico will call the shots in restructuring its debt. “Puerto Rico is now in charge and has taken control of the situation,” Donahue said. “They hold the money, and the creditors are dependent on them paying them back, so the tables have been turned,” he added. Those owed include Bond King Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine and the Oppenheimer Rochester Fund, led by Wall Street veteran Dan Loughran.

234,Surfing with famed chef Eric Ripert in Puerto Rico,"Paula Froelich, Yahoo Travel",2015-04-29,"About two months ago — right in the middle of Snowmageddon 2015 — my pal Eric Ripert called me up and said, “We are filming an episode of my show [Avec Eric] in Puerto Rico — want to come learn how to surf with me?” I took one look out the window and about half a nanosecond later said, “HELL YEAH!” In hindsight, I don’t know why I thought surfing was such a great idea. 1. I get seasick at the drop of a rudder. 2. I have a healthy respect for the ocean and all living things within it. [Read: I am petrified of sharks. So what if there hasn’t been a fatal attack there since 1924.]  3. I’ve never been known for my balance. But I’ve always liked the idea of surfing. It just looks so cool — you know? My friends do it and say it’s like meditating on the water — and I love meditating … you just sit there! I’m GREAT at sitting! So off I went. I met Eric at Rincon Beach — the surf capital of Puerto Rico — and our instructor, Jen, from the Rincon Surf School all duded up in my new wetsuit (which of course I bought, as I knew I was going to be SO GOOD at this I’d need this wetsuit forever). “I cannot swim very well,” Eric said. He was already starting to sweat. “I am nervous.” “It’ll be fine,” I said. So confident. So cool. So…wrong. A storm was blowing in — so even getting the 12-foot surfboard to the water was challenging…and then there were the 6-foot swells. An hour later, Eric and I were clutching the sand on shore for dear life — he with a minor back injury, me with bits of rocks embedded in my shoulder and heaving my lunch out on the sand. (Remember my seasickness issue?) And at that moment, it dawned on me: I will never be that cool surfer girl. And I will have to be OK with that. Sigh.

235,"North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Texas tickets win Powerball",Associated Press,2015-02-12,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Tickets in North Carolina, Puerto Rico and Texas have matched all six numbers to split a $564.1 million Powerball jackpot, lottery officials said Thursday. Sue Dooley, senior drawing manager and production coordinator for the Multi-State Lottery Association, said the Puerto Rico ticket was the first Powerball jackpot winner ever sold outside the continental United States. Puerto Rico joined Powerball less than a year ago. Besides 44 states and Washington, DC, the game is also played in the Virgin Islands, but there has never been a jackpot winner there, Dooley said. The Texas Lottery posted on Twitter early Thursday that one of the winning tickets was sold at Appletree Food Mart in Princeton, Texas. There was no immediate information on the cities or stores that produced the winners in North Carolina or Puerto Rico. It had been nearly a year since a Powerball prize reached the giant number people have come to expect recently. That was last February, when someone won $425.3 million. Wednesday’s jackpot was the third-largest in Powerball history and the fifth-largest U.S. lottery prize. The last time a Powerball jackpot climbed so high was May 2013, when a Florida ticket won a $590.5 million prize. Should the winners select the lump-sum option, each would get a one-third share of $381,138,450.16 before taxes. The other option is an annuity, under which the lottery would make payments 30 times over 29 years. The largest payout in US history was to three ticketholders in the Mega Millions game, the other national lottery drawing. That was a $656 million prize won in March 2012 by players in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland. In 2012, state officials who run Powerball and Mega Millions changed ticket prices and lowered the odds of winning jackpots in hopes the moves would increase the number of huge prizes and draw more players. The new rules worked, causing jackpots to repeatedly climb to record levels. More than half of the top 10 US jackpots have been reached in the past couple of years. The winning numbers in Wednesday’s drawing were: 11, 13, 25, 39, 54 and the Powerball 19. The jackpot now goes back to $40 million for the next drawing on Saturday.

236,Puerto Rico considers fining parents of obese children,Associated Press,2015-02-10,"Legislators in Puerto Rico are debating a bill that would fine parents of obese children up to $800 if the kids don’t lose weight. The bill aims to improve children’s well-being and help parents make healthier choices, Sen. Gilberto Rodriguez said in a statement issued Monday. Public hearings for the bill are scheduled to begin Friday. If approved, public school teachers would flag potential obesity cases and refer them to a counselor or social worker, depending on the severity of the case. Health department officials would then meet with the parents and determine whether the obesity is a result of bad eating habits or a medical condition. They also would create a diet-and-exercise program combined with monthly visits to ensure it’s being followed. After six months, officials would evaluate the child again, with parents possibly facing between $500 and $800 in fines if the situation does not improve within another six months to a year. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines childhood obesity as having a body mass index above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex. Several doctors including the president of Puerto Rico’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics have spoken out against the measure, saying it is unfair. More than 28 percent of children in Puerto Rico are considered obese, compared with some 18 percent in the US mainland.

179,Puerto Rico aims to become fully bilingual by 2022,,2014-11-20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  The governor of Puerto Rico is trying to do what more than a century of American citizenship has failed to accomplish: make Puerto Ricans fluent in English.Gov. Luis Fortuno, who has been mentioned as a possible Republican vice-presidential candidate, has proposed an ambitious, and what critics call far-fetched, plan to require all public schools to teach all courses in English instead of Spanish.The U.S. territory has had a long and contentious relationship with the English language, and many Puerto Ricans are skeptical about embracing it, fearing they will lose a key part of their identity and find themselves a step closer to statehood, a status that only about half of islanders have backed in recent polls.The governor wants Puerto Rico to become the 51st U.S. state. But he says his plan is about economic necessity, not politics.""Bilingualism opens doors and provides opportunity to our children so they can shine and become successful in a labor market that is increasingly competitive and globalized,"" he said.Only 12 of the island's 1,472 schools offer an all-English curriculum of the sort envisioned by Fortuno, while 35 other schools offer some courses in English, such as math and physical education, said Education Secretary Edwin Moreno.""The main idea is to have a Puerto Rican who can communicate in Spanish as well as English,"" said Moreno, who acknowledged that he himself has an imperfect command of English.Moreno is overseeing an initial $15 million project to install a bilingual curriculum in 31 schools starting in August and to reinforce the English-Spanish curriculum already in place in the 35 other schools. Plans for adding the rest are still hazy, but the governor says he wants all public school students to be bilingual within 10 years.Under the governor's plan, schools would continue to offer Spanish grammar and literature classes.Aida Diaz, president of the Puerto Rico Teachers Association, said that while she supports bilingual education, the notion of teaching all courses in English is extreme.""This is wrong,"" she said. ""This leads us to substitute our own language for a secondary one. It should not be that way.""All public schools are currently required to teach English from kindergarten through high school, and 9,000 teachers are devoted to that. But about 96 percent of the island's 3.9 million people speak Spanish at home, and some 2.8 million Puerto Ricans do not consider themselves fluent in English, according to the U.S. Census.That puts Puerto Rican children — and fellow U.S. citizens on the American mainland, as well — behind many Europeans in second-language skills.According to a 2006 European Community study, 56 percent of Europeans say they can hold a conversation in more than one language. About 90 percent in the Netherlands and Germany say they can do so. Only about a quarter of mainland Americans can do it, some studies indicate.Former Education Secretary Gloria Baquero said the biggest problem in Puerto Rico is the lack of good English teachers.""Their accent as well as their command of the language is not the best,"" she said. ""They know the grammar, but the spoken language is not their strong point. So we have a lot of English teachers who end up speaking Spanish in class because the children don't understand them.""One solution is to prepare teachers through immersion or exchange programs in the U.S., something that has been done intermittently, she said.Baquero said she and other educators support Fortuno's plan but warn it will be hard to implement: ""Many people resent the imposition of language and associate any attempt to improve their English with political motives.""Fortuno's proposal comes just months before voters face a two-part referendum in November to help decide the island's political status.The first part of the referendum will ask if voters want a change in status or prefer to remain a U.S. commonwealth. The second part will ask voters to choose from three options: statehood, independence or something in between called sovereign free association.GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has suggested that English be the official language for all U.S. states but has said there should be no language precondition on Puerto Rican statehood.English actually dominated Puerto Rican public education during the first half of the 20th century. From 1900 to 1948, all high school subjects were taught in English, until the island's first democratically elected governor, Luis Munoz Marin, ended the practice.""The learning of English was associated with a very real thrust by the U.S. government to Americanize Puerto Rico,"" said Carlos Chardon, an anthropologist and former education secretary. ""A great majority of persons associated English with statehood.""In 1991, Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon went further by declaring Spanish the island's sole official language. The law was repealed a couple of years later by Gov. Pedro Rosello, whose first official act was to make both English and Spanish the official languages, a law that stands to this day, even if only a few places have street signs in English.Puerto Ricans, however, remain reluctant to learn English, said Jaime Morales, a public school teacher in the northern town of Toa Baja who is fluent in English.""They are not interested,"" he said. ""Because honestly, it's hard to learn the language.""Morales said he supports the idea of a bilingual curriculum but doubts it will become a reality unless teachers are properly trained, parents get involved and the education system improves.""The main problem here is that you have a community that does not have good command of Spanish,"" he said. ""If they are deficient in Spanish, how do you pretend they are going to become fluent in a second language?""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-aims-to-become-fully-bilingual-by-2022,Fox,Conservative
237,Hundreds of dogs saved from massacre on Puerto Rico,Gary Buiso,2014-08-24,"When Stephen McGarva and wife Pamela decided to move to Puerto Rico because of her job, he jumped at the chance to ­explore the sun-soaked islands. On their first week in the lush resort community in Humacao in October 2005, McGarva — an artist, extreme-sports addict and professional free spirit — went exploring remote Playa Lucia beach for a killer wind gust. “I noticed what I thought was a pile of coconut husks,” he told The Post. “When I got closer, I said, ‘Oh, my God, it’s a dog.’ ” The pathetic pooch — a husky with one ocean-blue eye — was a clump of skin and bones, resembling more than anything a child’s crude sketch of a dog. ­McGarva then noticed gashes on the creature’s sunburned hide. “Yet despite it all, he was still wagging his tail,” said McGarva, 48, whose life was changed the moment he committed himself to running to the grocery store to buy food for the suffering dog. “When I came back, I saw a bunch of noses sticking out of the jungle. There were 16 other dogs in the same condition. I said, ‘OK, I didn’t buy enough food.’ ” These were the abused strays who lived in fear on the cursed shoreline locals called Dead Dog Beach, where McGarva would for the next two years rescue hundreds of dogs — and bury over 1,000 more. “It was a dumping ground for unwanted pets,” McGarva said, adding that the culture there was more accepting of dumping dogs once they become too big, too expensive or less cute. Once ditched, they faced threats from many fronts, explained McGarva, the author of “The Rescue at Dead Dog Beach,” which comes out Tuesday.  “They’d get rid of any unwanted animal that was going to be an eyesore,” McGarva said. Other locals simply took pleasure in abusing the dogs. “Some people would use the dogs as target practice for paintball,” he recalled. “I found dogs with welts, broken ribs and splattered with paint.” Others ran over the dogs, poisoned them, hung them up to die in a boathouse or hacked them up with machetes. It was an expensive cause. McGarva initially shelled out about $1,000 a month on food and medications, “exponentially higher” as he tended to a pack of about 60-100 dogs at any one time. “I felt almost like a creepy cult leader,” he joked. But the more McGarva did for the dogs, the more he became a target. “I was the long-haired gringo helping the dogs,” he said. He was followed, his home burglarized, and he was shot at — they missed, but they hit the dog he was carrying. “I had come to terms with ­dying this way,” he said. “I went back home, and I did not tell my wife about it.” And when he was approached by men with machetes, it was his dogs who came to the rescue. “I ran for my car and they followed, but the dogs cut them off,” McGarva said. “All I remember were the sounds of people yelling and yelping. And when I turned around, I saw three of my biggest dogs dead on the ground.” Eventually, he went to the mayor’s office to sound the alarm, but he received a chilling message: “In Puerto Rico, you cross the wrong people, you go for a long boat ride and you may not come back,” McGarva recalled. With the local government slow to do anything to help the dogs’ plight, McGarva eventually arranged for about 270 to be flown from the island for adoption. “I just didn’t want the dogs to die in vain,” he said. Volunteers continue his efforts in Puerto Rico, and McGarva, who continues his work with ­animal-rescue groups, now lives in Massachusetts and is raising his own pack — two kids and a border collie named Briana, one of the island dogs he helped give a new lease on life.

238,Puerto Rico looks to be yielding to hedge-fund pressure,Michelle Celarier,2014-02-18,"Puerto Rico looks ready to cave to hedge-fund demands that it waive sovereign immunity to get a new $3.5 billion financing done, officials indicated in a webcast Tuesday. The deal will allow Puerto Rico to stave off default on its $70 billion debt. The willingness to forgo sovereign immunity has been a touchy point in negotiations — what one investor called a “slippery slope” for the Commonwealth. Puerto Rico, whose muni debt was recently downgraded to junk status, plans to repay and refinance outstanding debt with the proceeds of the new financing. The $3.5 billion will only last for about two years. It is expected to carry an interest rate north of 10 percent. Puerto Rico’s muni investors include notable hedge funds like Dan Loeb’s Third Point, Fir Tree and Arrowgrass Capital Partners. Third Point, whose Puerto Rican muni bonds were one of its top five losing positions last year, said it isn’t negotiating with the government on the new deal. But hedge fund Stone Lion Capital Partners put it bluntly — asking on the webcast with Puerto Rican officials if they would agree to a New York venue [should it be hauled into court in the event of a default] and a waiver of sovereign immunity. “We’re open to including provisions that are in the best interests of the Commonwealth,” replied one Puerto Rican official, saying it is “currently inclined to accept” those terms. Waiving sovereign immunity will put Puerto Rico in a perilous situation, said Hans Humes, CEO of hedge fund Greylock Capital and a veteran of sovereign restructurings. Humes said an additional annual interest payment of $350 million for Puerto Rico, on top of what it is now unable to pay, is a “substantial amount for a non-growth economy. Hedge funds are setting it up for default.” ",https://nypost.com/2014/02/18/puerto-rico-looks-to-be-yielding-to-hedge-fund-pressure/,New York Post,Conservative

242,"Puerto Rico ousts governor, backs US statehood",Post Staff Report,2012-11-07,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Ricans have endorsed U.S. statehood for the Caribbean island but also ousted the pro-statehood governor in a close election. Gov. Luis Fortuno conceded defeat Wednesday to his main challenger after concluding there were not enough outstanding ballots to close the gap with his main challenger, Alejandro Garcia Padilla. The margin in Tuesday’s vote was less than 1 percent. “Now it’s time for us to come together as one people. The campaign is over,” Fortuno said in a news conference. Fortuno, as a member of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, said he was pleased that 61 percent of voters endorsed becoming a U.S. state, though critics said the two-part ballot was confusing to many and would not be enough to persuade the Congress to accept Puerto Rico into the union. Fortuno, who is also a Republican, was a supporter of U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and campaigned for him in Florida. Garcia is part of the Popular Democratic Party, which wants Puerto Rico to remain semi-autonomous U.S. commonwealth. The two-part referendum asked whether the island wanted to change its 114-year relationship with the United States. Nearly 54 percent, or 922,374 people, sought to change it, while 46 percent, or 786,749 people, favored the status quo. Ninety-six percent of 1,643 precincts were reporting as of early Wednesday. The second question asked voters to choose from three options, with statehood by far the favorite, garnering 61 percent. Sovereign free association, which would have allowed for more autonomy, received 33 percent, while independence got 5 percent. President Barack Obama earlier expressed support for the referendum and pledged to respect the will of the people in the event of a clear majority. Fortuno and Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, the island’s representative in Congress, said the results of the referendum will be delivered to the Obama administration and the leadership in Congress with the hope that they will back the bid for statehood. “The ball is now in Congress’ court and Congress will have to react to this result,” Pierluisi, a member of the pro-statehood party who was re-elected Tuesday. “This is a clear result that says ‘no’ to the current status.” The island is currently a U.S. territory whose inhabitants are U.S. citizens but are prohibited from voting in presidential elections. Its resident commissioner in the U.S. House also has limited voting powers. Garcia celebrated his victory with supporters at party headquarters. “I can assure you we have rescued Puerto Rico,” Garcia said. “This is a lesson to those who think that the well-being of Puerto Ricans should be subjected to ideologies.” ",https://nypost.com/2012/11/07/puerto-rico-ousts-governor-backs-us-statehood/,New York Post,Conservative

So Fortuno’s fortunes on Election Day will be a barometer for such dynamic reformers as New Jersey’s Chris Christie, Ohio’s John Kasich and New Mexico’s Susana Martinez. Fortuno took office in 2009, and moved rapidly to slash government spending (while boosting government efficiency) and cut taxes. And his work has paid off in strong economic growth. Two months after his swearing in, Fortuno slashed government outlays by over $2 billion from a budget of $13 billion — including a 10 percent cut in his own salary. He trimmed thousands of redundant workers from the government payroll, including a 30 percent cut in political appointees. These cuts reduced Puerto Rico’s budget deficit by 90 percent; next year, the commonwealth will have a balanced budget for the first time in years. And this January, Fortuno implemented Puerto Rico’s largest tax cuts in history. He cut taxes by 50 percent for individuals; for corporations, the top rate dropped from 41 percent to 30 percent and will fall to 25 percent in 2014. Businesses that create jobs in Puerto Rico will pay a rate as low as 4 percent, with their dividends receiving tax-exempt status. Rather than govern cautiously in order to remain popular in a difficult political climate, Fortuno spent his political capital implementing a reformist agenda. Which of course meant major pushback in the form of protests from government unions. It was a similar scene to the one that played out in Wisconsin. And like Scott Walker, Fortuno’s results will speak for themselves. Between April 2010 and March 2011, all three of Moody’s, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s raised Puerto Rico’s credit rating. From a high of 16.4 percent, unemployment in Puerto Rico has fallen every month since Gov. Fortuno’s tax-cut package. The current rate of 13.6 percent is still high, but the decrease is more than double the US decline in unemployment over the same period. Now that Fortuno’s tax-relief package is taking effect, the economic outlook is bright: Indicators in retail sales, auto sales, home sales and cement sales are in positive territory. August was the ninth consecutive month of positive year-over-year growth, a trend Puerto Rico hadn’t seen since March 2006. The current fiscal year will be the first in which Puerto Rico’s economy sees positive economic growth in six years. In fact, all 17 states that elected a Republican governor in 2010 have had drops in unemployment. These states are creating jobs at a rate 50 percent higher than the nationwide rate. By contrast, New York unemployment has risen from 8 percent to 8.9 percent since March 2011. According to the most recent polls, Gov. Fortuno trails his challenger by 2 points, while Gov. Cuomo’s approval rating is at 67 percent. When governors play it safe, their approval ratings may soar — but their states will founder. When governors lead, their poll numbers may take a hit — but those they govern are the better for it. Still, Nov. 6 will be a big test in Puerto Rico: Can the politics of fiscal discipline and economic growth be political winners, or will the safe politics of the status quo prevail? David Laska is a spokesman for the New York Republican State Committee. ",https://nypost.com/2012/10/30/puerto-rico-tea-time/,New York Post,Conservative
244,Knicks’ Melo visits Puerto Rico to unveil charity efforts,Post Staff Report,2012-09-13,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Carmelo Anthony is in Puerto Rico to unveil remodeled basketball courts at a public housing complex and play a bit of softball with celebrity friends. It is the third time the New York Knicks star has visited the U.S. territory in as many years to rebuild basketball courts through his charitable foundation. “There’s plenty of kids down there who need role models,” he said during a press conference Thursday. “I grew up in a situation like that. … It was survival of the fittest.” The two newly remodeled courts, located in the northern city of Bayamon, are used by the island’s top minor league players and have produced players now part of the island’s Superior League, said Sports and Recreation Secretary Henry Neumann. “It is an emblematic court,” he said. About 350 children currently use the two courts, which are within the Magnolia Gardens public housing complex. They will be unveiled on Sunday. Last year, Anthony and his foundation restored a basketball court in the northern coastal town of Luquillo, and in 2010, they refurbished a popular court in La Perla, a famous seaside slum in historic Old San Juan. He will also host a free-admission celebrity softball game Saturday with other athletes, including Knicks teammates Amare Stoudemire and Raymond Felton, former Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams, and NBA players Marcus Camby and J.J. Barea. Anthony said he was looking forward to bonding with the Knicks’ new and younger players and dismissed criticism that he and Stoudemire aren’t working well together. “We sit in the locker room (and) laugh about all the comments,” he said. The five-time All Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist said the Knicks also are mourning the departure of point guard Jeremy Lin, who joined the Houston Rockets in July. “I know it was kind of hard for the Knicks to let him go,” Anthony said. “(The Houston Rockets) played the free agents’ market to a ‘T.’” Anthony, whose father was Puerto Rican, said he expects to refurbish more of the island’s courts in the future.

Police say the body of Bronx resident Kenah Huggins was found Sunday in a river in El Yunque, the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest system. Huggins was apparently taking photographs in the mountain park on Saturday and was swept away by a rushing river after she lost her footing. El Yunque is located in northeastern Puerto Rico and receives up to 1 million visitors a year. After Huggins’ death, Puerto Rico’s tourism agency issued a statement exhorting visitors to be careful around rivers, lakes and bodies of water swollen by the heavy rains left behind by Tropical Storm Isaac.

246,Florida on alert after Hurricane Irene slams into Puerto Rico,Post Staff Report,2011-08-22,"MIAMI — As Hurricane Irene pummeled Puerto Rico, South Florida emergency officials directed staff to halt routine operations and switch strictly to storm mode Monday. “Hurricane preparations are pretty much the order of the day,” said Mike Geier, Palm Beach County radiological emergency preparedness planner. “We go through a pretty extensive checklist. It’s probably three pages long.” The U.S. National Hurricane Center’s current forecast has Irene hitting southern Florida as a hurricane by Thursday. The storm, which marks the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season, could also clip Georgia and the Carolinas. By Monday morning, Hurricane Irene was moving west-northwest away from Puerto Rico at roughly 14 mph (22 kph) with maximum sustained winds near 75 mph (120 kph). Irene’s center was about 55 miles (90 kilometers) west-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Forecasters said the main impediment to the storm’s progress over the next couple of days will come if it hits land. If Irene passes over Hispaniola’s mountains or over parts of eastern Cuba, the storm could weaken more than currently expected. “However, if the system ends up moving to the north of both of those land masses it could strengthen more than expected,” forecaster Richard Pasch wrote. Broward County emergency officials had already begun preparations Monday morning. Fifteen emergency management staffers were asked to report to work to monitor the storm. Emergency management director Chuck Lanza said staff will soon begin calling roughly 1,000 special needs residents, including elderly and disabled residents, to assess what kind of help they’ll need if Irene hits South Florida. Those residents could be transported to shelters Wednesday or Thursday depending on the storm’s progress. Irene pummeled Puerto Rico overnight, flooding the streets and leaving more than a million without power. There were no immediate reports of any deaths.

248,Mets at home in Puerto Rico,Mike Puma,2010-06-28,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The Marlins will get the gate receipts and last at-bat, but there is no mistaking who the home team will be for the next three nights at Hiram Bithorn Stadium. “Puerto Ricans are pretty much Mets fans,” said Angel Pagan, a Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, native. Give the Marlins credit for trying something different, moving a series in an effort to increase fan support as they prepare to unveil a new downtown Miami ballpark in 2012. METS-TWINS BOX SCORE REPORT: LEE AVAILABLE NOW But the Mets, with a roster that includes Puerto Rico natives Pagan, Alex Cora, Pedro Feliciano and Jesus Feliciano, are the indirect benefactors. It will be MLB’s first return to Puerto Rico since 2004, when the Expos played 22 home games on the island to gauge fan interest for a possible franchise relocation. The Expos, who ultimately moved to Washington and became the Nationals, also played 22 home games at Bithorn Stadium in 2003. “It didn’t feel like a regular major league city,” said Jason Bay, who played for the Pirates in a series here against the Expos in 2004. “When we were there, a police officer with a machine gun was escorting us on and off the bus into the stadium. “It was a different feel to it — not better or worse. You just knew you weren’t in Atlanta for another three-game series. I think it’s kind of cool.” Cora, who has twice represented Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic, said it will be the ultimate thrill wearing a Mets uniform for the next three nights. “It’s something you dream about,” Cora said. “When the Expos played there, I always looked at the schedule and never got a shot to do it. I hoped to be back with the Mets, so I’d have a shot to do it.” Carlos Beltran is among those not expected in uniform for this series. Though Beltran, a Manati, Puerto Rico, native, has told friends he badly wants to play these games, the Mets have no plans to end his minor-league rehab assignment after only four days and thrust his surgically-repaired right knee onto the artificial turf at Bithorn Stadium. Pagan remains questionable to play tonight after missing the last four games with muscle spasms in his right side, but just being here will be special to him. And he’s hoping the series produces much more than three possible victories for the Mets. “The baseball [in Puerto Rico] is slowing down — the kids are not thinking about baseball anymore,” Pagan said. “Now that major league players are coming to play again in town, baseball is going to be up again. The kids are going to see us as an example, and they are going to want to play again and keep following us.” mpuma@nypost.com ",https://nypost.com/2010/06/28/mets-at-home-in-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative

250,Puerto Rico fuel fire health risk,Associated Press,2009-10-25,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Thousands of people living on the outskirts of a burning fuel-storage site in Puerto Rico were urged to relocate today to avoid toxic smoke still billowing from the fire. More than 1,500 people were evacuated after Friday’s earthshaking explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. in the suburb of Bayamon, just west of the capital of San Juan. Only a few people were slightly injured by the blast, which broke windows, tore doors off their hinges and shook the ground. But authorities are now concerned about those downwind of the fire, with breezes pushing smoke toward more populated neighborhoods. Authorities urged residents — especially those with respiratory problems — who live near the site to temporarily move elsewhere until the fire is extinguished and the smoke brought under control. “To those people with respiratory problems, our recommendation is that you not wait,” Gov. Luis Fortuno said. Several people have sought medical help for respiratory distress, and one firefighter was treated Saturday for exposure to high temperatures, Fortuno said. Those who were evacuated and an additional 530 people who sought shelter away from home have not returned. Fortuno said a large stadium has been prepared to accommodate some 30,000 people who live in the area if necessary. Crews were monitoring the situation and anticipated more evacuations if weather worsened. “The smoke is extremely toxic,” said Jose Bartolomei, a state epidemiologist who monitors asthma. “An asthmatic patient will definitely hyper-react to this.” Adding to the danger is the presence of invisible gases such as carbon monoxide and sulfur, said Luis Antonio Ocasio, spokesman for the island’s Environmental Quality Board. Local officials, along with a New Jersey crew from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are monitoring the air with handheld devices and probing whether any fuel spilled into the nearby ocean, he said. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation. Fifteen of 40 fuel tanks caught fire, and five were still burning Saturday afternoon, Fortuno said. He has declared a state of emergency for five municipalities, including San Juan and Bayamon, but said initial estimated damages of $6.4 million are not sufficient to receive federal funds. Gulf spokesman Eric Guzman said Saturday that the company has hired an independent crew to help quell the fire and that it is cooperating with authorities. He said he did not know how much fuel is stored in the tanks. AP-ES-10-24-09 1756EDT  ",https://nypost.com/2009/10/25/puerto-rico-fuel-fire-health-risk/,New York Post,Conservative

252,Red Bulls draw Puerto Rico Islanders,Brian Lewis,2009-02-10,"Photo from Red Bulls The Red Bulls’ played their third preseason scrimmage today at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, and came away with a scoreless tie against CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinalist Puerto Rico Islanders. And while I’m sure he would’ve rather won 4-0, one glance at the lineups Juan Carlos Osorio has used should show he’s just trying to get a good look at all his trialists and doesn’t care much about results. But he said after they’ve all had three 45-minute chances to show their stuff, he pretty much has his mind made up about each of them. Midfielder Jorge Rojas has left after being called up for Venezuela’s friendly on Wednesday, but winger Dane Richards did not get his visa, so he won’t be flying to London for Jamaica’s game. The Red Bulls face Toronto at 3 p.m. on Friday; let’s see if the lineup for that one is any more telling. They return to New York the next day. There’s running commentary on Red Bulls Reader, and here’s video of Osorio afterwards. As far as the Islanders, ex-Metro Kevin Mesa is on the team, as is keeper Bill Gaudette, who trained with the club. But Red Bull trialist Lionel St. Preux, a 23-year-old Haitian National Team striker, actually had a cup of coffee with the Islanders last year, but they didn’t have a spot in their midfield for him. BTW, those that know his game say he plays better as an attacking midfielder. This is the Red Bulls’ first-half lineup: —————–St. Preux—————– Kandji——————————–Mbuta ————–Roth——-Zimmerman——— —————–Gutierrez—————— Saintil——–Palguta—–Mendes——-Parratt ——————Cepero——————- And this is the second half lineup: ——————-Wolyniec——————— Perez Bernal——————————Colaluca ————-Hall———Mashriqi————— ———————Leigh——————— Borman——Kljestan———Mirsky———Leitch ———————Cepero———————- Yes, that’s Borman at left back. Considering Perez Bernal is 5-foot-1, that’s like a pair of Oompa-Loompas scampering around on the left flank. Granted, you won’t likely see either of them starting over there. I’m curious to see who this left-back that Osorio is pursuing turns out to be. As far as right backs, I’m curious to see if they offer Costa Rican Carlos Johnson a deal, or how young Scot Tom Parratt is working out. (Our friends over at The Offside point out that the ex-Inverness man was better known in UK circles for his fine female. After taking a look, I can see why).

253,Red Bulls thin at striker as Megaloudis joins Puerto Rico,Brian Lewis,2008-06-14,"By BRIAN LEWIS Think the Red Bull forwad corps for tonight’s pivotal game at D.C. was depleted before, with Juan Pablo Angel injured and Jozy Altidore transferred? Now Chris Megaloudis is out, choosing to play for Puerto Rican in its World Cup qualifier vs. Honduras. That leaves John Wolyniec as the almost-certain starter alone in a 4-5-1, with recovering Oscar Echeverry _ who hasn’t seen the field since Game 2 of the season _ as the only backup. Their strike force is thinner than Keira Knightley. Red Bulls strikeforce thinner than Keira Knightley âI think he has shown enough. He has two good feet, quick, I think I am prepared to use him when the time allows for it and the time is right I think he will contribute,” coach Juan Carlos Osorio had said Thursday. “We need Chris this week. Hopefully he will be available for us.â He won’t be, having left at practice yesterday while the rest of the team hopped an Amtrak. Puerto Rico lost 4-0 in the first leg of its aggregate series, meaning this second leg holds about as much suspense as the average Lifetime movie. But the reality is the Red Bulls could’ve faced FIFA sanctions had they not let him go; as if they don’t habve enough troubles with eight games in 27 days and both Designated Players Angel and Claudio Reyna out with herniated discs. That leaves Wolyniec playing alone in a 4-5-1 formation that could at times be a 4-3-3 with Dane Richards and Danleigh Borman on the wings. But the youngsters can’t leave him stranded there. “Hopefully we will be able to provide (Wolyniec) with better service. When Juan has done that job he has also found it very difficult to play because the service comes from the flanks, from the two midfielders that give him support,” Osorio said. “If we can feed the ball to him and he can get a hold of the ball then he will do a great job for us.â ",https://nypost.com/2008/06/14/red-bulls-thin-at-striker-as-megaloudis-joins-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative

There were more screams when last year’s grand marshals, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez, made surprise appearances on separate floats before uniting for a kiss. Gov. Spitzer and Puerto Rican Gov. Anibal Acevedo-Vila joined Bloomberg at the head of the parade. “I think the most impressive thing is that people love to be living here and be part of New York and be New Yorkers. At the same time, they’re very proud of their heritage, of where they come from,” Bloomberg said. The parade featured bands and uniformed city workers dancing to salsa booming from floats. One of the floats was sponsored by The New York Post. It featured a performance by reggaetón super-duo Wisin y Yandel. Police sources said 173 people were arrested for unlawful assembly for wearing the black-and-yellow colors of the Latin Kings gang or flashing gang signs.

I will be doing my job like always. But what will be different will be the Puerto Rican Day parade [Sunday]. I will be more open to the public. Who was your favorite boxer or idol growing up? I never really had an idol in boxing. I just got into it because the rest of my family was into the sport. My brothers, just following them… We just had the regular brother fights at home. Any burden carrying the Puerto Rican flag and being the figure-head for Puerto Rican boxing? I go in there to do my job. I don’t get involved with any extra pressure. I just focus on my job. What is the true Breakfast of Champions? It all depends on my workouts. Nothing too heavy. Today I had fruits and cereal. Why did you choose Daddy Yankee to do your entrance music? Because Daddy Yankee is such a hard worker. I decided to take advantage of both of us being in the same city for the same two weeks for the Puerto Rican Parade. What is your favorite boxing movie: I watch every single kind of movie, not just boxing and not just sports. Because boxing is my profession and I see it seven days a week, whenever I am out of [work mode], I try to not be involved with boxing. What is your take on the Mets not allowing you to take a photo with your buddy Carlos Beltrán during batting practice? The politics are not in my hands. From my part and Carlos Beltrán’s side, you can be sure we have the best willingness to do this. Boxers or briefs? None. No underwear. What’s your favorite song on your iPod:?

Williams,2004-09-21,"Puerto Rico is a tiny, rectangular-shaped island that is part of the archipelago of the Antilles. An archipelago is an expanse of water with many small islands. The archipelago of the Antilles stretches more than 1,500 miles from Florida to Venezuela in South America and is divided in two parts. The Greater Antilles contains, among others, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. These are the largest islands. The Lesser Antilles has, among others, Barbados, Martinique, Trinidad and the Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico’s coast is about 360 miles long. The capital is San Juan. The smaller islands of Mona, Vieques and Culebra are part of Puerto Rico. The island has a diverse terrain. It’s mostly mountains – 60 percent. But there is also rainforest, beaches, caves, rivers and even a desert. Puerto Rico is a warm and humid place. The tropical climate of around 80 degrees makes it an ideal vacation spot, especially during a cold New York winter. Among the flora, or plant life, you’ll find are mangroves, ferns orchids and mahogany trees. As for the fauna, or wildlife, even though the island is mostly mountains, you don’t have to worry about mountain lions. There are no large wild mammals. Migrating birds take a break on their way to other places. The common creature and endearing symbol of the island is an inch-long frog called the coqui. The coqui is hard to see, but easy to hear. The frog was named for the ever-present two-toned “ko-kee” song that the males sing. The elusive coqui, unlike other frogs, are not great swimmers and spend most of their time on land. The distinctive little amphibian can be found only on the island of Puerto Rico. The indigenous or native people of Puerto Rico are the Tainos and Arawaks. The beginning of the end for them came in 1493, with the arrival of Christopher Columbus. By 1511, nearly all of the Tainos and Arawaks were gone, felled by genocide, disease and the effects of being forced to work all day in the hot weather. After African slaves were imported onto the island, sugar cane became the main cash crop. Puerto Rican food may seem similar to Spanish and Mexican cuisine but it is, in fact, a unique blend of Spanish, African, Taino and American influence. Essential seasonings include coriander, wild oregano and achiote. The Arawaks and Tainos lived on a diet of corn, tropical fruit and seafood. After Columbus arrived, beef, pork, rice and olive oil were added. After slaves were imported from Africa, cultivated crops like okra, taro and sugar cane were added. Puerto Rico came under United States sovereignty by the Treaty of Paris, signed on Dec. 10, 1898, terminating the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917. Puerto Rico was established as a commonwealth in 1952, which allows the country to make its own laws, but U.S. federal law is the last word. More than 1 million Puerto Ricans now call New York their home. “Nuyorican” is a unique term that combines New York and Puerto Rican. It refers to members and the culture of the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York. New York’s largest Puerto Rican population is in The Bronx – 48 percent. But other large communities live in Brooklyn, East Harlem and the Lower East Side as well as Queens and Staten Island. Influences of Puerto Rican culture can be found all over the city in food, fashion and music. It’s an ingredient that makes New York’s melting pot one tasty stew.

257,GOLDEN DREAMS – PUERTO RICO-BORN MARITZA CORREIA TRIES TO SWIM ALL THE WAY TO OLYMPIC VICTORY,Andrew Marchand,2004-08-11,"IN Olympian Maritza Correia’s room in Athens, Ga., she has the Puerto Rican flag on one wall, the Guyana flag on another and the United States on another. In Athens Greece, Correia will become the first black female swimmer in United States Olympic history, but she will represent even more. Her parents are from Guyana. She was born and lived the first eight years of her life in San Juan, Puerto Rico. And she became one of the best swimmers in the U.S. growing up near Tampa in Valrico, Fla. “I usually say I am Hispanic because I was born in Puerto Rico,” the 23-year-old Correia said from Greece. “I say I am South American because my parents are Guyanese. My family is mainly black so we just say we are black.” Correia – who moved to the States after her father, a mechanical engineer, was transferred in 1989 – will compete in the 4 x 100 freestyle relay. Before making the United States team, Correia considered representing Puerto Rico, but rules stipulate that a swimmer must skip one year between representing different countries.

258,METS HOPING PUERTO RICO TRIP WON’T BE DEJA VU,Mark Hale,2004-04-09,"MET NOTES ATLANTA – Last year, the Mets went into Puerto Rico and played four games against the Expos. It didn’t exactly go well. The Mets dropped all four games on the trip, the latter two heartbreakers. In the third game, Armando Benitez blew the save in the ninth before Jose Vidro homered off Mike Stanton to win it in the 10th. The next day, the game was tied in the bottom of the eighth before the Met pen allowed two runs to lose again. So when the Mets visit San Juan for a three-game set tonight, they’re hoping for a better outcome. And although the situation last season was bizarre – Hiram Bithorn Stadium had unusually small dimensions, the turf was spongy, etc. – the Mets know that different atmosphere or not, they need to play better this time. “It’s a baseball game,” Art Howe said. “You’re playing against another major league club. Both teams are playing in the same atmosphere. They outplayed us [last year].” One thing to watch this year is the dimensions at Hiram Bithorn have been changed to resemble the ones at Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, so the games might have less offense. * Before last night’s game, the Braves honored Hank Aaron for the 30th anniversary of his historic 715th homer off Al Downing. Howe, then 27 years old, remembered seeing it. “I was watching it on TV like the rest of the world,” he said. “I knew when he hit it, it was gone. He said he wasn’t sure. I was. That was some moment.” * Cleveland claimed Mets reliever Jason Anderson off waivers. The Mets had acquired Anderson in the Armando Benitez deal . . . Karim Garcia started in right and, with RHP John Thomson on the hill, batted second. * The pitching matchups vs. the Expos: tonight, Tyler Yates vs. RHP Zach Day; tomorrow, Al Leiter vs. RHP John Patterson; Sunday, Tom Glavine (1-0, 3.00) vs. RHP Livan Hernandez (0-0, 3.00).

259,AYUSO GETS SHOT AT NBA – SPURS INK PUERTO RICO STAR,Fred Kerber,2003-08-28,"SAN JUAN – From Puerto Rico to The Bronx to Roswell, N.M., to USC to the NBA. With places such as Greece, Italy and Grand Rapids thrown in along the way. Yup, it has been a long, strange trip for Elias Larry Ayuso, the starting off-guard for Puerto Rico’s national team and a former college teammate of Net Brian Scalabrine. Ayuso, 26, who left Puerto Rico at age 7 for The Bronx before being adopted by a couple in New Mexico, yesterday agreed to a partially guaranteed contract with the San Antonio Spurs. And with all he has gone through and is about to embark on, he had to laugh at the first question he heard. “That’s the first question everybody asks, ‘What’s up with Roswell?’ Honest, I’ve never seen any UFOs. There might be some out there,” said the 6-foot-3 Ayuso, who was Scalabrine’s teammate for two years at USC after spending time at Morris High and St. Raymond’s in The Bronx and then leading New Mexico high school scoring as a senior for Roswell High in ’94-95. Ayuso caught the eye of San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, who is assisting Larry Brown with Team USA here in the Olympic qualifying event. “They watched me play in New York,” Ayuso said, referring to the scrimmages and exhibition game Puerto Rico played against the Americans two weeks ago. “I talked to Coach Popovich and he liked the way I played and my aggressiveness. They said I’m a guy who can help them. “I’m just very excited about the chance,” added Ayuso, who made some news here last week when he threw a punch at one of the Mexican players outside the arena after a game. “To play in the NBA, it’s something I always dreamed of. I’m proud because of all the work I’ve done and especially [that it is with] the champions of the NBA.” Ayuso, who scored 37 points to beat Turkey at the World Championships in 2002 and had a tryout with the Lakers that same year, left The Bronx as a teen-ager. And it was the best thing that ever happened to him, he said. He joined a program called SAFE – Student Athletes For Education, and he was transplanted to New Mexico, where he met a caring couple, Dick and Diane Taylor, who adopted him. “With SAFE, they were giving students chances where the atmosphere was wholesome and they went to school in New Mexico,” Ayuso explained. “I joined the program, and that’s where I met Dick and Diane Taylor and they gave me the resources and the opportunity to get where I am now.” Diane Taylor has worked tirelessly to promote Ayuso and try to help him get a shot with his basketball career by serving as his liaison with teams. This past year, he was the MVP with Ionikos in the Greek league. He also played in Italy and the CBA. After leading the state of New Mexico in scoring he went on to USC, where he played with Scalabrine. Ayuso said he visited with the Net forward – who recently re-signed with New Jersey – when he was in New York. “I was able to visit with him when I was there,” Ayuso said. “I’m happy for him and I’m excited to see him doing well.” ",https://nypost.com/2003/08/28/ayuso-gets-shot-at-nba-spurs-ink-puerto-rico-star/,New York Post,Conservative
260,"BARRETT, CANADA STUN PUERTO RICO",Fred Kerber,2003-08-22,"TEAM USA NOTEBOOK SAN JUAN – Former St. John’s star Rowan Barrett made it sound as simple as he made it look for Canada last night. “Run to the spot, be open, catch the ball, shoot it,” said Barrett, referring to playing with Dallas star Steve Nash. Barrett scored 32 points, hitting 12 of 20 shots, including 4-of-7 on 3-pointers, and Nash had 17 points, nine rebounds and seven assists as Canada upset home-team Puerto Rico, 89-79, in the Olympic qualifying tournament. “I was so focused I never noticed we were down 14 [in the first half]. They were just making great plays,” said Barrett, 30, who played for St. John’s in 1996 when his teammates included Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton and who has just signed to play in France. * The Nets’ Trio Grande here has made history. For the first time in the history of the nine USA Basketball senior men’s teams that have featured NBA stars, there are three players from the same club. That distinction came when Kenyon Martin replaced Karl Malone and joined Jason Kidd and Richard Jefferson. “The USA Nets,” said Kidd. “It’s a great honor to have three guys, Kenyon, R.J. and myself participating. It’s an honor but we have to respect the NBA season. We have to put it together. It doesn’t mean we’re going 82-0.” “Go Nets,” deadpanned Jefferson. In other Nets news, the team yesterday re-signed restricted free agent Brian Scalabrine to a two-year deal worth around $1.5 million. * Argentina and Brazil took out their frustrations of day-one defeats with blowout victories in the Olympic qualifying tournament here. Argentina, victim of a stunning upset by Mexico, completely dominated Uruguay, building a 15-point lead by halftime en route to a 91-60 devastation. Brazil, manhandled by the U.S. Wednesday, got 18 points and seven rebounds from Guilherme Giovannoni in 20 minutes during a 100-74 romp past the Virgin Islands. * Vince Carter is enjoying his reunion with cousin and former Raptor teammate Tracy McGrady. “We get to bring back old times,” Carter said. “We still have a kinship. Believe it or not we’re able to work together. It’s like we’re able to pick up where we left off.” Carter claimed he and Jefferson revisited their sneaker commercial – during layup drills. “We just go out there and have a little fun, it’s like the commercial, have some fun and let people see what we can do.” ",https://nypost.com/2003/08/22/barrett-canada-stun-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
261,APPLE SET FOR PUERTO RICO PARADE,Philip Messing,2002-06-09,"The Puerto Rican Day Parade – a rite that traditionally marks the beginning of summer in the Big Apple – kicks off today with several hundred thousand jubilant participants expected to join the festivities. New York’s Finest are expected to keep a watchful eye upon the revelry, which will start with parade formations amassing at 9 a.m. between West 44th and West 48th streets, from Vanderbilt Avenue to Sixth Avenue; and from West 43rd Street to West 44th Street, on Fifth Avenue. At 11 a.m., parade marchers will head uptown on Fifth Avenue, ending at West 86th Street. ",https://nypost.com/2002/06/09/apple-set-for-puerto-rico-parade/,New York Post,Conservative
262,PRIDE ON PARADE IN SALUTE TO PUERTO RICO,Maria Alvarez,2000-06-11,"Today’s Puerto Rican Day parade will be a mix of politics, music and pride – all focused on shutting down the U.S. naval base on Vieques, which has been a practice bombing target for 60 years. Two million people are expected to attend today’s parade, which kicks off at noon and heads north on Fifth Avenue from 44th Street to 86th Street. Ruben Berrios, president of the Puerto Rican Independent party, will be one of the parade’s leaders. Berrios faces six months in jail for occupying the military target range on Vieques halting bombing practices for more than a year. His one-man protest turned into a national Puerto Rican movement that united all political parties, labor unions and religious groups. “I embrace the people of New York. I feel very much at home here with you,” said Berrios, who was the guest speaker at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s action rally in Harlem yesterday. Berrios, who goes on trial Monday in a U.S. Circuit Court in Puerto Rico and is in the middle of a campaign for governor in Puerto Rico, said, “If this imperial court in Puerto Rico, which imposes itself on Puerto Ricans, should choose to send me to jail, I will go with a clear conscious. “We have the same struggle. We know what is slavery and what is colonialism,” said Berrios, whose Latin American rhetoric against Yankee imperialism brought the mostly black audience to their feet chanting Berrios name, “Ruben, Ruben, Ruben.” Congressman Jose Serrano said Berrios represents the “conscious of Puerto Rico.” He said today’s parade will be about music and pride, “but it will also bring Puerto Rican issues to the forefront.” The parade is dedicated to Pedro Albizu Campos, founder of the Puerto Rican Independent party. Campos, a nationalist leader, fought for independence and served 25 years in U.S. prisons. Also marching in today’s parade will be Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to walk behind a banner asking for the immediate shutdown of the naval base – a plan that has not been endorsed by her husband. Other politicos expected to march are Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio and Mayor Giuliani. ",https://nypost.com/2000/06/11/pride-on-parade-in-salute-to-puerto-rico/,New York Post,Conservative
263,PUERTO RICO: U.S. RENEGED ON VIEQUES ISLAND DEAL,Brian Blomquist,1999-12-04,"President Clinton yesterday ordered the Navy to halt all live bombing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques — but local Gov. Pedro Rossello blasted the move as “unacceptable.” Rossello’s rejection of Clinton’s decision stunned White House aides, who said they thought the governor was prepared to agree to Clinton’s offer of $40 million for economic development on Vieques and a promise to kick out the Navy in five years. But sources close to Rossello claim Clinton reneged on a promise to include land in the deal. “Personally, I feel deceived with the position that’s been taken, because it doesn’t faithfully reflect what we’ve been discussing with the president,” an angry Rossello said yesterday. Clinton and Rossello have been talking for weeks about how to handle the volatile situation. Sources close to Rossello said Clinton promised that the United States would immediately give Puerto Rico the eastern part of the island, which is now held by the military. The sources said Rossello also was told Puerto Rico would get the Navy-occupied western part of the island on Dec. 31, 2000, with an arrangement to lease it back to the Navy for training. Sources said Rossello was furious that the president’s final offer, based on the recommendation of Defense Secretary Bill Cohen, didn’t contain any of those provisions. In New York, Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund Executive Director Juan Figueroa said the Puerto Rican community will not be satisfied until the Navy withdraws completely from the island. “The White House wants to do the right thing,” Figueroa said. “But the Navy is digging in their heels. They don’t want to leave.” Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley, asked about whether the president reneged on a land offer, responded, “The president talked to Gov. Rossello. I don’t know what the content of those conversations were.” The Navy has used Vieques to train its Atlantic Fleet battle groups since World War II. Exercises have included live artillery and bombs, amphibious landings and war games. ",https://nypost.com/1999/12/04/puerto-rico-u-s-reneged-on-vieques-island-deal/,New York Post,Conservative
264,TRINIDAD GETS HIS OSCAR:PRIDE OF PUERTO RICO HANDS DE LA HOYA HIS FIRST CAREER LOSS,Kevin Kernan,1999-09-19,"LAS VEGAS – A furious charge finally stripped away the Golden Boy’s crown – and a questionable ruling by the judges. Felix “Tito” Trinidad won a stunning majority decision over Oscar De La Hoya last night to win the welterweight title at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. It was a controversial decision with judge Glen Hamada scoring the fight even at 114-114. Jerry Roth had Trinidad ahead, 115-113 and Bob Logist scored it 115-114 for Trinidad. The Post scored the fight 115-113 for De La Hoya. De La Hoya appeared to want to show the world he wanted to box and did not come with the idea of winning a fight. He was more interested in being Oscar De La Ali and slowed his assault the last three rounds, costing him the fight.. Trinidad suffered a bloody nose and swollen left eye, but battled to the end. Trinidad came on strong in the last three rounds to take the fight. De La Hoya appeared to be putting on a clinic and then allowed Trinidad to take control. According to CompuBox, De La Hoya landed 263 of 648 punches while Trinidad connected on 166 of 462 punches. De La Hoya landed 120 of 217 power punches and Trinidad scored on 124 of 318 power shots.. In the end, Trinidad stood on the ropes in his corner with his right glove over his heart, pumping his hand furiously as if to say, “I have more heart than Oscar.” “My tactic was to take his confidence away,” De La Hoya said, “but we can go to dinner now if we want. I know I won. He’s a great fighter, very strong, I hurt inside emotionally. Hopefully we can do it again. I thought I had the fight easily. I wanted to demonstrate a boxing show, but I guess it didn’t work. I’m very sorry. I’ll be back. Some people didn’t appreciate my lesson.” “I always said from the very beginning I was the No. 1 welterweight,” Trinidad crowed, “and I proved it tonight. In the last four rounds all he did was run. I will give him a rematch, but that’s between Don King, Bob Arum and the TV people to figure out.” Another windfall profit for the fighters, too. De La Hoya will make between $21 million and $28 million. Trinidad bagged between $10-14 million. There will be a rematch. Both 26-year-old welterweights went into the fight undefeated. Trinidad was 35-0 with 30 knockouts. De La Hoya was 31-0 with 25 KOs. Trinidad had knocked out 11 of the last 12 fighters he has faced. Tito entered the ring wearing an oversized straw hat and a headband that read Trinidad. He came in weighing 156 while De La Hoya, who made his entrance wearing a striking blue velvet robe came into the ring at 152 pounds. Trinidad forgot his mouthpiece, delaying the start of the fight. Bobby Nunoz, one of his handlers, furiously checked his pockets, and then the corner went into a slight panic, looking for the mouthpiece. It finally arrived and the fighters were ready to go. The first round De La Hoya measured Trinidad and did not throw a punch until halfway through. The round appeared even with De La Hoya taking six of the next seven rounds. Oscar stole the second round at the end landing a 1-2 combo, drawing a spot of blood from Trinidad’s left nostril. Soon it was drops of blood all over Trinidad’s white trunks. Trinidad could not deal with De La Hoya’s movement, just as De La Hoya predicted. De La Hoya continued the assault in the third. Trinidad landed his strongest blow in the fourth, a right counter and also got a good left hook to take his first round on the Post’s card. Trinidad now pushed De La Hoya and was the aggressor but again Oscar came with a three-punch strike that nearly closed left eye of Trinidad. At that point his father Joel was happy with his son, smiling broadly at ringside. De La Hoya continued to box beautifully and Trinidad’s only damage came after the bell in the seventh when he caught him with a left. De La Hoya was fuming and called him in the next round and continued to out-box Trinidad. De La Hoya was successful on a number of combinations, while Trinidad did not land a combo the entire fight. Trinidad again threw a late punch at the end of the round that missed De La Hoya. The De La Hoya clinic continued and in the 10th he stood and boxed, allowing Trinidad to take the round. De La Hoya tired at this point and Trinidad gave it his best in the 11th and the 12th. Before the fight yesterday morning Hector Camacho was spotted in the Sports Book of the Mandalay Bay. Asked who would win, Camacho thought long and hard before delivering this most telling comment, “All I know is they both hit hard.” Camacho is one of three men to have fought both of the Millennium Men, losing both fights on a decision. Oba Carr and Pernell Whitaker are the others. It turns out that Trinidad punched the hardest. “For the longest time I have believed that I am the best in the world,” Trinidad said going into the fight. “Finally, I have my chance.” And he made the most of it. He will now be considered in the class of Puerto Rico’s greatest sports heroes, including the one and only Roberto Clemente. “To mention my son and Clemente is a great tribute,” said his father trainer Don Felix.
