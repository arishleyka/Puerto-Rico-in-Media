0,Biden in Puerto Rico: 'We're going to make sure you get every single dollar promised',Maegan Vazquez and Allie Malloy,10/3/22," President Joe Biden , first lady Jill Biden, and Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell are visiting Ponce, Puerto Rico, on Monday -- weeks after  Hurricane Fiona  ravaged the US territory. In Puerto Rico, Biden received a briefing on the storm and met with individuals who have been impacted. He also announced $60 million in funding from the  bipartisan infrastructure law  to shore up levees and flood walls, and to create a new flood warning system to help residents better prepare for future storms. ""We have to ensure that when the next hurricane strikes, Puerto Rico is ready,"" Biden said during his remarks at the Port of Ponce.  Biden hailed the people of Puerto Rico for their resilience and promised that as long as he's president, the federal government is not leaving until ""every single thing we can do is done.""   Hurricane Fiona, Biden said, has been an ""all too familiar nightmare"" for Puerto Ricans who survived Hurricane Maria in 2017. ""Through these disasters so many people have been displaced from their homes, lost their jobs and savings or suffered injuries -- often unseen but many times seen -- but somehow, the people of Puerto Rico keep getting back up with resilience and determination,"" he remarked. ""You deserve every bit of help your country can give you. That's what I'm determined to do and that's what I promise you,"" the President continued. ""After Maria, Congress approved billions of dollars to Puerto Rico, much of it not having gotten here initially. We're going to make sure you get every single dollar promised.""  The Ponce region experienced  significant storm damage  and power had been restored for  86% of residents  there as of Sunday evening. Biden also participated in a pull-aside meeting with families and community leaders impacted by the storm.  Biden's trip to Puerto Rico  comes five years to the day  that then-President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria, where he was snapped tossing paper towels into a crowd gathered at a chapel where emergency supplies were being distributed. Trump repeatedly praised the federal response to the storm, but in the wake of a series of deadly hurricanes in 2017, FEMA issued a report saying it was underprepared and could have better anticipated the severity of the damage. Throughout his travels on Monday, Biden expressed how his administration was aiming to do better than previous federal response efforts on the island.  On Monday morning, Biden suggested that the island has not been well taken care of following previous storms, telling reporters: ""I'm heading to Puerto Rico because they haven't been taken very good care of. We've been trying like hell to catch up from the last hurricane. I want to see the state of affairs today and make sure we push everything we can.""  During his speech at the Port of Ponce, the President also told Puerto Ricans, ""You have had to bear so much and more than need be and you haven't gotten the help in a timely way."" And Criswell, who accompanied Biden on the trip, acknowledged the challenges the federal government has faced in gaining the trust of Puerto Ricans after the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria in 2017. She said aboard Air Force One en route to Puerto Rico that ""there may have been some issues in the previous administration"" and that the people of Puerto Rico ""finally feel like this administration cares for them."" Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Puerto Rico on September 21, a White House fact sheet said, and over 1,000 federal response workers were on the ground providing support with over 450 members of the Puerto Rico National Guard activated. The Biden administration also  approved a Jones Act waiver  last week, opening up the potential for additional diesel to be shipped to Puerto Rico, following intense pressure on the White House.  The Jones Act  requires all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans, but the Department of Homeland Security may grant a waiver when those vessels are not available to meet national defense requirements. Biden has ""been in regular contact"" with Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, the White House has said. The President will also travel to Florida this Wednesday, where he will survey damage from  Hurricane Ian . This story and headline have been updated with additional updates.

0,Biden Promises Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief Where Trump Fell Short,Lydia O'Connor,10/3/22,"President Joe Biden arrived in Puerto Rico on Monday to survey the damage from Hurricane Fiona and announce more than $60 million in additional funding to help the U.S. territory prepare for future storms, which are only expected to become stronger and more frequent with climate change.  “Somehow the people of Puerto Rico keep getting back up with resilience and determination,” Biden said in Ponce, which was pummeled by more than 30 inches of rain when the storm hit in mid-September. “We’re going to make sure you get every single dollar promised.”Hurricane Fiona knocked out 100% of the power on Puerto Rico and brought the island its worst flooding since the devastating Hurricane Maria in 2017. While most people have regained power, more than 137,000 others are still in the dark, and 66,000 are still without water.The $60 million in additional funding Biden announced Monday will be put toward shoring up levees, strengthening flood walls and creating a new flood warning system.“We know that the climate crisis and more extreme weather are going to continue to hit this island and hit the United States overall, and as we rebuild, we have to ensure that we build it to last,” the president said. “We are not leaving here, as long as I’m president ― and I mean this sincerely ― until every single thing we can do is done,” Biden vowed.It was one of several apparent nods to the way his predecessor, Donald Trump, fumbled relief for Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, repeatedly downplaying the death toll and denying any of his administration’s shortcomings. In one of the more bizarre moments from his time in office, Trump chucked rolls of paper towels at a crowd in San Juan, Puerto Rico’s capital city, while millions of people went without power. “I’m heading to Puerto Rico because they haven’t been taken very good care of,” Biden told reporters as he left the White House for Ponce. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi also alluded to those issues before Biden took the mic in Ponce.  “In short, my asks to you, Mr. President, are straightforward: We want to be treated in the same way as our fellow Americans in the states in times of need,” he said. Pierluisi asked Biden to extend the Hurricane Fiona disaster declaration for another 180 days to cover the cost of debris removal and other recovery efforts ― which Biden said he is “confident” can be done. Damage in Puerto Rico from Fiona is currently estimated at $3 billion, but officials expect that figure to rise as assessments continue. The catastrophic rains and flooding killed at least 21 people, set off more than 100 landslides around the island and destroyed major roads and bridges.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
1,"At least 25 deaths in Puerto Rico may be linked to Hurricane Fiona, island health department says",Ray Sanchez,9/30/22," Less than two weeks after Hurricane Fiona barreled through Puerto Rico, the island's health department says at least 25 deaths may be linked to the storm.  Fiona  hit the US territory as a Category 1 storm on September 18, dropping record rainfall, unleashing mudslides, flooding neighborhoods and leaving most of the island without power or water. It made landfall almost exactly five years after Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, delivered a blow from which the island has never fully recovered.  On Friday -- as Floridians assessed the destruction left by  Hurricane Ian  and the storm made landfall in   South Carolina as a Category 1 -- more than 230,000 customers in Puerto Rico were still without electricity, according to the   PowerOutage.US  website. More than 800,000 customers were without power last weekend.  Nearly 80,000 customers -- about 6% -- of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority were without water on Friday, according to the  government's emergency portal system website. Puerto Rico's Health Department said Friday that up to 11 deaths were confirmed as attributable to the storm. At least 14 other cases were still being investigated. One of the confirmed deaths came as a direct result of Fiona, and 10 others were indirectly related.  The deaths involved 18 people over 65 years of age, according to the  department website.   The fatalities included a 58-year-old man who was swept away by La Plata River behind his home in Comerío, and a 70-year-old man who died in a fire after attempting to fill his generator with gasoline in Arecibo, according to officials. Fiona was the first hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since September 20, 2017, when Maria left thousands dead and triggered a blackout that lasted months for many of the island's more than 3 million residents. Puerto Rico's government, after initially saying only 64 people died as a result of Maria, later placed the  death toll at nearly 3,000  -- making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in US history.  President Joe Biden,  speaking at FEMA headquarters Thursday,  said his administration has not forgotten the victims of Fiona in Puerto Rico. ""While we're seeing the devastating images in Florida, I want to be clear, to the people of Puerto Rico: We're not gone away,"" said Biden, who added that he intends to visit Florida and Puerto Rico.  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday approved a  federal waiver  opening up the potential for additional diesel to be shipped to Puerto Rico.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-deaths/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiV_t_v08j6AhWbQzABHVR4DbgQFnoECAQQAg&usg=AOvVaw2s9Hv8p8j3NMzmH9IFU8Vc,CNN,Liberal
2,DHS approves Jones Act waiver to ensure diesel for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona,Geneva Sands and Maegan Vazquez,9/28/22," Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday approved a federal waiver opening up the potential for additional diesel to be shipped to Puerto Rico following the devastation of Hurricane Fiona last week.  The announcement of the Jones Act waiver approval comes after the Biden administration  faced increasing pressure  to approve it to allow a British Petroleum ship loaded with diesel to enter one of Puerto Rico's ports. The Jones Act -- also known as  the Merchant Marine Act of 1920  -- requires all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans. But those ships are far more expensive to buy and operate than foreign ones, making just about everything in Puerto Rico more expensive. DHS may grant a waiver when American vessels are not available to meet national defense requirements.  On Tuesday, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said DHS was ""actively"" working on the approval process, but emphasized that the request needed to meet legal requirements put in place by Congress. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi had asked the DHS secretary to personally intervene in the matter, and eight members of Congress, led by New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Velazquez, issued a letter to Mayorkas calling for a temporary waiver. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah also called on the federal government to issue a waiver. Mayorkas said in a Wednesday statement that DHS would approve a ""temporary and targeted"" waiver. ""In response to urgent and immediate needs of the Puerto Rican people in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona, I have approved a temporary and targeted Jones Act waiver to ensure that the people of Puerto Rican have sufficient diesel to run generators needed for electricity and the functioning critical facilities as they recover from Hurricane Fiona,"" the secretary said. Puerto Rico has before received a disaster-related Jones Act waiver when then-President Donald Trump issued a waiver after Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/politics/puerto-rico-jones-act-diesel-hurricane-fiona-dhs/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiV_t_v08j6AhWbQzABHVR4DbgQFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw0zoGUhB_JBC24hkSb4gaRF,CNN,Liberal
1,Puerto Rico Still Reeling From Hurricane Fiona As Hurricane Ian Bears Down On Florida,Nick Visser,9/27/22,"Around a third of Puerto Ricans are still without power more than a week after Hurricane Fiona struck the island, with the U.S. now bracing as a separate storm heads to Florida.The island’s power operator, Luma Energy, said about 33% of homes and businesses, or about 490,000 customers, were without electricity as of 8 a.m. Tuesday morning. Thousands of others remain without access to running water, and officials have warned that the initial recovery effort could take weeks.Those figures are down from the nearly 1.5 million Puerto Ricans who didn’t have power Saturday, but they still present a major hurdle nine days after the storm hit the island. At least three people have died, although Puerto Rico’s governor said as many as 16 deaths may be linked to the storm.President Joe Biden has faced mounting pressure to issue a federal waiver so that a BP ship carrying diesel can access a port on the island to help alleviate the power crisis. The White House, however, says its hands are tied by a provision known as the Jones Act that imposes federal shipping restrictions.Fiona battered the U.S. territory with 85 mph winds earlier this month, knocking out power to the entire island and bringing back memories of 2017’s Hurricane Maria. That storm struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 behemoth, causing widespread damage and killing more than 3,000 people.After Maria, the government allocated billions of dollars in relief funding to update the island’s patchwork power grid, but much of that money hasn’t been spent. Lawmakers have renewed calls to update Puerto Rico’s electricity system, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer last week said an “ongoing conflict” had hamstrung efforts to do so. “Instead of making it a resilient grid, a locally based grid, they’re busy fighting with each other,” Schumer said, referencing the privately held Luma Energy and the government-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.The island’s ongoing recovery comes amid the new threat of Hurricane Ian, a monstrous Category 3 storm taking aim at Florida. Ian swept over Cuba on Monday night, and it is prompting tens of thousands to evacuate Florida’s Gulf Coast before an expected landfall Wednesday night.Biden has pledged full federal support for those in Ian’s path, saying the Federal Emergency Management Agency and his administration are “on alert and in action.”“We’ll be with you every step of the way,” the president told Americans on Tuesday. “We’re not going away.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
3,"Misery, yet again, for Puerto Ricans still recovering from Maria",Ray Sanchez,9/24/22," At the end of Valencia Street in this southeastern coastal town, Carmen Baez was proud that neighbors were using her washing machine valves to collect fresh water.  The valves, sprouting like flowers from the ground, were all that was left of her small house near the edge of the Guamaní River, which overflowed and swallowed her yellow, cabin-like home, other houses on the block, her stepfather's vintage Toyota and four of her eight beloved cats. A friend hid her house keys after Baez evacuated to her mother's home on higher ground, she said, preventing her from returning to fetch the cats during the storm. ""People are coming from different places,"" said Baez, 50, standing under a sweltering sun. ""We let them know so they can come and get water.""  That she could help others provided some comfort days after  Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico  as a Category 1 storm on Sunday, dropping record rainfall, unleashing landslides and mudslides, flooding neighborhoods and leaving most of the island without power or water. Fiona arrived almost exactly five years after  Hurricane Maria,  a Category 4 storm, delivered a blow from which the island has never fully recovered. It has left many Puerto Ricans marveling anew at the kindness of neighbors, revisiting the age-old debate about leaving the US territory for the mainland and questioning their confidence in the island's political leadership.  ""I'm debating what to do,"" said Baez, who has previously lived in New York and Connecticut. ""I had a home. It wasn't a mansion but it was my home. Now I have nothing. Am I going to get help?""   Flooding even more widespread than Hurricane Maria Fiona made landfall in southwestern Puerto Rico last Sunday afternoon. It was the first hurricane to touch down here since September 20, 2017, when Maria left thousands dead and triggered a blackout that lasted months for many of the island's more than 3 million residents.  Puerto Rico's government, after initially saying only 64 people died as a result of Maria, later placed the  death toll at nearly 3,000  -- making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in US history.  At least two deaths  have so far been attributed to Fiona.    Hurricane Fiona pelted all of Puerto Rico with heavy rain -- more than 30 inches in some areas in the south and the central mountain region -- and caused flooding that was more widespread than the historic 2017 storm. Parts of the island had more rain than during Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico with winds topping 160 mph. The day after Fiona made landfall, there were more than 2,000 people staying in shelters across the island, according to Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. Many have since returned home or are temporarily staying with relatives.   At least 1,000 Puerto Ricans were rescued by emergency crews, the National Guard reported.  Fiona's unrelenting rain and widespread flash flooding that turned streets into muddy streams washed away bridges and tore open roads that had been repaired after Maria. It overflowed rivers and streams, and caused pumps to fail after the power went out, leaving thousands of homes without water and functioning sewer systems. On Saturday, 847,447 customers -- about 53% of all households and businesses -- of the island's power company,  LUMA Energy , still had no power. Some 1,062,192 customers, or 80% of all users, now have running water. There were still 265,548 customers -- about 20% of all households and businesses  -- of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority without water on Saturday, according to the government's  emergency portal system website.    'Call 911 ... We are in danger' On Thursday afternoon in the southern coastal town of Salinas, Jacqueline Rivera and husband Luis Vasquez cleaned out the small, one-bedroom beach house where they have lived since the pandemic. Their clothing and other belongings were strewn about the muddy ground outside the wood-paneled home, about 11 miles west of Guayama.  ""This was the quietest, most peaceful place,"" she said, ""until Sunday.""   Their neighborhood, Villa Esperanza, which sits between the beach and the Nigua River, is dotted with fallen trees, pieces of aluminum siding and boats washed away from their trailers. The blue-and-white house next door collapsed into a crater in the cracked, mud-filled ground in a community of cabins and trailers used mostly on weekends.      On Sunday evening, after Fiona made landfall, Rivera and Vasquez were forced to leave their elevated house when flood waters started to pour over the concrete wall surrounding the property. They moved, with their three Chihuahuas, to their 20-foot boat, which was raised, hitched to a trailer and tethered by rope to a concrete wall in the rear yard. It was about 7:30 p.m. ""Then we see a boat floating down the street like someone was driving it,"" said Rivera, a 54-year-old nurse. ""Right down the middle of the road,"" said Vasquez, 60, who works as a plumber.  ""Then a trailer with a small porch floated down as if someone was lifting it up with their arms,"" she said. ""That was followed by a neighbor's new boat, then a jet ski floated down. That's when I heard an explosion and the house across the street sank into the ground.""    They prayed as the water started rising around their boat. Rivera said somehow her cellphone still worked. She called friends and coworkers.     ""Please call 911. Please call the National Guard,"" she implored. ""Put this on Facebook. We need prayers. We are in danger. If the rope connecting the boat to the wall broke, we would not be here. This was not the river anymore. It was like a raging brown sea with waves that surrounded us.""  Their prayers were answered about 2 a.m. Monday. A National Guard truck came down an adjoining street after the flood waters had receded. They managed to get to the truck safely.   Storms hit, people leave. Will it happen again? In the immediate aftermath of Maria, an  estimated 130,000 people  -- almost 4% of the population -- left the island, according to US Census Bureau data from 2018. The data reflected a population change between July 1, 2017, before the storm, and the same date the following year. The population of the US territory has long been falling. Amid a debt crisis and other problems, more than 530,000 people have left Puerto Rico since 2010, the agency said in 2018. It remains to be seen how Fiona's aftermath, along with mounting economic and political upheaval, will affect migration to the mainland. Puerto Ricans are American citizens who can move freely to US states.  Rivera and Vazquez have grown children who live in Florida and North Carolina. She said she is more open to migrating than her husband but admitted it would be hard to leave.  ""We have to fight for what little we have,"" Rivera said.  Blue tarps from Maria's aftermath linger In an impoverished neighborhood in the northern coastal town of Loiza, about 18 miles west of the capital of San Juan, Ramona Jimenez, 73, looked out from her front porch with her three grandchildren -- ages 3, 8 and 12. The neighborhood flooded after Fiona and since Monday, waste water from the sewage system bubbled out of underground pipes onto the dirt street, forming smelly pools of dark water. She said she keeps the windows closed, even on the scorching days that followed Sunday's storm.    ""Puerto Rico is stuck in the past,"" she said. ""Nothing changes.""  Jimenez got a new roof installed by a nonprofit in February but around her home several houses were still covered with blue tarps made of waterproof material that were intended to stay up until  permanent repairs could be made to rooftops. Five years after Maria, more than 3,000 homes still have blue tarps, according to local press reports.       ""This is a marginalized community, like so many across the island, and no one cares what happens to us,"" said activist Sonia Martinez, who had been distributing donated food to families in Loiza.  Another community activist, Modesta Irizarry, 53, on Friday distributed bags of food and water to the mostly elderly residents of her community. Two other women, sisters Tatiana and Maria Pacheco, drove from the town of Trujillo Alto with a pickup truck full of donations and food items they had raised money to buy. ""Since Hurricane Maria, people have been losing faith in the government,"" said Maria Pacheco, 31, who owns a gym. ""So we want to deliver these donations straight to the people who need them.""  Maria Pacheco said she doesn't want to leave the island, though many friends have headed to the mainland in recent years.  ""I could make more money elsewhere but I'm from here,"" she said. ""You may be better off economically but not emotionally because you're always going to miss Puerto Rico."" She added, ""We can't change ... geographically but we can change politically. It's sad but I don't see a short-term solution. I'll stay as long as I can. I want my children to be born here."" Irizarry teared up at one point as she was preparing the bags to be distributed to about 50 families. ""We want to send a message that our people are important and that we matter,"" she said. ""We will not be forgotten.""  Their first stop with the bags of food was the home of Ana Luz Pica, 77, who had cooked meals for volunteers after Hurricane Maria. Pica thanked them.  ""This is a blessing,"" Pica said.  On a nearby beach in Loiza, fisherman Jorge Calderon, 54, was giving away bags of fresh fish, shrimp and crabs that he had netted in the days after the storm. In exchange, residents have brought him breakfast and lunch.  ""Some people speak badly about Loiza but there are many good people here,"" said Calderon, whose brother Ivan, a former Major League Baseball outfielder, was fatally shot in Puerto Rico in 2003.  Neisha Caraquillo, 29, sat on the beach with her two young children, ages 4 and 7, and an empty plastic bag in her hand, waiting for Calderon's next catch.   ""There's enough here for all of us,"" he said.  Starting again -- maybe somewhere new Back in Guayama, on the southern coast, Baez, whose home was swept away in floodwaters on Sunday, has returned to her block every day to feed and play with the three kittens who managed to escape and reach an adjoining house during the storm.  The mother of the kittens had also survived but Baez hasn't seen her since Monday.     Baez called out the names of the kittens -- Jacob, Jeffrey and Batman -- and they emerged from the bushes of a neighbor's house that remained standing.  She said she plays with the kittens and reminisces about the days she sold clothing and food out of her home. She had recently saved up enough money to purchase a new stove and washing machine that were swept away with her home.  Baez has a daughter who lives in Hartford, Connecticut. Her daughter plans to visit next month, and Baez said she will make a decision about whether to leave the island.   ""I was getting my things, little by little, and now I have to start over,"" she said. ""That is life here.""

4,Many across Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic still have no power or running water as Hurricane Fiona churns toward Bermuda,Aya Elamroussi and Alaa Elassar,9/22/22," More than a million people in  Puerto Rico  and the Dominican Republic are without power or running water again Thursday as crews work to repair critical utilities disabled by Hurricane Fiona, which is now a Category 4 monster heading toward Bermuda. The first major hurricane of this year's Atlantic season has killed at least five people across the Caribbean: one in Guadeloupe, two in Puerto Rico and two in the Dominican Republic. TRACKING FIONA ""This was something incredible that we've never seen before,"" Ramona Santana in Higüey, Dominican Republic, told CNN en Español. ""We're in the streets with nothing, no food, no shoes, clothes, just what's on your back. ... We don't have anything. We have God, and the hope help will come."" Now packing sustained winds of 130 mph, the center of Fiona is due to pass just west of Bermuda early Friday, with conditions starting to deteriorate Thursday, said CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford. The island nation is under a hurricane warning; Americans are warned not to travel there, and relatives of US government personnel may leave, the State Department said. ""The National Hurricane Center is certain that Bermuda will experience tropical-storm-force winds,"" Shackelford said. ""Once Fiona passes by Bermuda, the storm is forecast to impact Nova Scotia by Saturday afternoon."" In the Canadian province, residents should prepare for tropical storm-like or even hurricane-like conditions starting as early as Friday evening by securing outdoor items, trimming trees, charging cell phones and creating an emergency kit, said Jason Mew, director of the emergency management office. Shelters will be open for those experiencing homelessness and anyone else in need, he said. The Canadian Hurricane Centre has issued a hurricane watch for Nova Scotia from Hubbards to Brule, Prince Edward Island, Isle-de-la-Madeleine, and the coast of Newfoundland from Parson's Pond to Port aux Basques. Hurricane Fiona ""could be Canada's version of Sandy,"" Canadian forecasters warned, comparing the size and intensity as well as the combination of a hurricane and a more winter-like storm such as a nor'easter. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for several coastlines in Atlantic Canada, including from west of Brule to Cap Madeleine, Quebec, and Anticosti Island. Residents in Atlantic Canada need to be prepared for a long period of utility outages and structural damage to buildings, according to Environment Canada, Canada's national weather service. ""Fiona will be historic for Atlantic Canada,"" said Brian Tang, atmospheric science professor at the University of Albany. Meanwhile,  a developing storm  poised to be named Hermine could become a monstrous threat to the US Gulf Coast by next week, forecast models showed. In Puerto Rico, where Fiona delivered flooding rains and an islandwide blackout as it made landfall Sunday, more than 450,000 people lacked or had intermittent water service, according to the government's  emergency portal system . As of Thursday, 495,000 customers, about 38%, have electricity in Puerto Rico, according to LUMA Energy, which operates the island's power grid. About 890,000 customers, or 67% of all users, now have running water, according to Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Executive President Doriel Pagán Crespo. In the Dominican Republic, where Fiona moved onto land early Monday, 725,246 customers remain without running water and more than 210,000 homes and businesses were dark Wednesday, said Maj. Gen. Juan Méndez García, director of the country's emergency operations center. More than 2,260 homes were destroyed, and some communities were cut off from aid, he said. Electricity problems dog Puerto Rico As Fiona hit the Dominican Republic in the middle of the night, Iverice Viera rushed in waist-deep floodwater to wake up her neighbors in Higüey, she said. She's now trying to dry out her belongings. ""The rooms are empty. I had to throw away a lot. There's no electricity or water to wash anything,"" Viera told CNN en Español. Puerto Rico, in the meantime, was making some progress on the relief front. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration Wednesday for the US territory, FEMA said. The move allows residents to access grants for temporary housing and home repairs as well as low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses. ""This ensures that our people will have access to additional help from FEMA to recover from the damage caused by this event,"" Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said in a  tweet . But crews have faced setbacks in restoring power. Equipment problems have temporarily knocked lines believed to have been repaired back offline, Josué Colón, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, said Wednesday. Fiona hit almost exactly five years after  Hurricane Maria  plunged the island into an extended blackout. Across the island, more than 800 people were housed in dozens of shelters Wednesday, according to Puerto Rico's housing secretary, William Rodriguez. New York City's mayor has deployed staff from city agencies to Puerto Rico to help officials surveying damage. ""The team will include representatives from New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM), New York City Department of Buildings, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and the New York City Department of Design and Construction,"" according to a news release from the mayor's office. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced Thursday his authorization of aid and recovery efforts for Puerto Rico, including the deployment of 74 New Jersey State Troopers and a civilian medical doctor. Fiona also menaced parts of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday, and many areas of the British territory were still without power Wednesday, namely on Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos, said Anya Williams, acting governor of the islands. Officials there were relieved no one was killed in the storm, they said as they began visiting islands and making repairs. CNN's Melissa Alonso, Jessica Hasbun, Jorge Venegas, Amy Simonson, Chris Boyette and Jamiel Lynch contributed to his report.

2,Biden: U.S Won't Walk Away From Storm-Struck Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,9/22/22,"SAN SALVADOR, Puerto Rico (AP) — President Joe Biden said Thursday the full force of the federal government is ready to help Puerto Rico recover from the devastation of Hurricane Fiona, while Bermuda and Canada’s Atlantic provinces prepared for a major blast from the Category 4 storm.Speaking at a briefing with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials in New York, Biden said, “We’re all in this together.”Biden noted that hundreds of FEMA and other federal officials are already on the ground in Puerto Rico, where Fiona caused an island-wide blackout.More than 60% of power customers remained without energy on Thursday, and a third of customers were without water — and local officials admitted they could not say when service would be fully restored.Biden said his message to the people of Puerto Rico who are still hurting from Hurricane Maria five years ago is: “We’re with you. We’re not going to walk away.”That seemed to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who was widely accused of an inadequate response to Maria, which left some Puerto Ricans without power for 11 months.The hurricane was expected to still be at Category 4 force overnight when it passed close to Bermuda, where authorities opened shelters and announced schools and offices would be closed Friday.Fiona’s outer bands were already reaching the British territory Thursday afternoon.It was expected to still be a large and dangerously potent storm when it reached Canada’s Atlantic provinces, likely late Friday, as a post-tropical cyclone.“It’s going to be a storm that everyone remembers when it is all said and done,” said Bob Robichaud, warning preparedness meteorologist for the Canadian Hurricane Centre.Hundreds of people in Puerto Rico remained cut off by road four days after the hurricane ripped into the U.S. territory, and frustration was mounting for people like Nancy Galarza, who tried to signal for help from work crews she spotted in the distance.“Everyone goes over there,” she said pointing toward crews at the bottom of the mountain who were helping others also cut off by the storm. “No one comes here to see us. I am worried for all the elderly people in this community.”At least five landslides cover the narrow road to her community in the steep mountains around the northern town of Caguas. The only way to reach the settlement is to climb over thick mounds of mud, rock and debris left by Fiona, whose floodwaters shook the the foundations of nearby homes with earthquake-like force.“The rocks sounded like thunder,” recalled Vanessa Flores, a 47-year-old school janitor. “I’ve never in my life heard that. It was horrible.”At least one elderly woman who relies on oxygen was evacuated on Thursday by city officials who were working under a pelting rain to clear paths to the San Salvador community.Ramiro Figueroa, 63, said his bedridden 97-year-old bedridden father refused to leave home despite insistence from rescue crews. Their road was blocked by mud, rocks, trees and his sister’s pickup, which was washed down the hill during the storm.National Guard troops and others brought water, cereal, canned peaches and two bottles of apple juice.“That has helped me enormously,” Figueroa said as he scanned the devastated landscape, where a river had changed its course and tore up the community.At least eight of 11 communities in Caguas are completely isolated, said Luis González, municipal inspector of recovery and reconstruction. It’s one of at least six municipalities where crews have yet to reach some areas. People there often depend on help from neighbors, as they did following Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in 2017 that killed nearly 3,000 people.Miguel Veguilla said that in Maria’s aftermath he used picks and shovels to clear debris. But Fiona was different, unleashing huge landslides.“I cannot throw those rocks over my shoulder,” he said.Like hundreds of thousands in Puerto Rico, Veguilla has no water or electricity service, but said there is a natural water source nearby.Danciel Rivera, 31, arrived in rural Caguas with a church group and tried to bring a little cheer by dressing as a clown.“That’s very important in these moments,” he said, noting that people had never fully recovered from Hurricane Maria. “A lot of PTSD has reared its head these days.”His huge clown shoes squelched through the mud as he greeted people, whose faces lit up as they smiled at him.Puerto Rico’s government said some 62% of 1.47 million customers remained without power Thursday. A third of customers, or more than 400,000, did not yet have water service.“Too many homes and businesses are still without power” Biden said in New York, adding that additional utility crews were set to travel to the island to help restore power in the coming days.The executive director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Energy Authority, Josué Colón, told a news conference that areas less affected by Fiona should have electricity by Friday morning. But officials declined to say when power would be restored to the hardest-hit places and said they were working first to get energy to hospitals and other key infrastructure.Neither local nor federal government officials had provided an overall estimate of damage from the storm, which dropped up to 30 inches of rain in some areas.The U.S. center said Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) late Thursday afternoon. It was centered about 280 miles (455 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda, heading north-northeast at 20 mph (31 kph).Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 70 miles (110 kilometers) from the center and tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 205 miles (335 kilometers).Bermuda Premier David Burt sent a tweet urging residents to “take care of yourself and your family. Let’s all remember to check on as well as look out for your seniors, family and neighbors. Stay safe.”The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane watch extensive coastal expanses of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island.Hurricanes in Canada are somewhat rare, in part because once the storms reach colder waters, they lose their main source of energy. and become extratropical. Those cyclones still can have hurricane-strength winds, but now have a cold instead of a warm core and no visible eye. Their shape can be different too. They lose their symmetric form and can more resemble a comma.Fiona so far has been blamed for at least five deaths — two in Puerto Rico, two in the Dominican Republic and one in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe.Fiona also hit the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday, but officials there reported relatively light damage and no deaths.___Associated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington, Seth Borenstein in New York, Rob Gillies in Toronto and Maricarmen Rivera Sánchez in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.",[],HuffPost,Liberal

Jenniffer González  has been the resident commissioner since January 3, 2017. The commissioner serves in the US House of Representatives, but has no vote, except in committees. Gonzalez is the  first woman  to hold this position. It is made up of 78 municipalities. Over 40% of the population lives in poverty,  according to the Census Bureau. Puerto Ricans have voted in six referendums on the issue of statehood , in 1967, 1993, 1998, 2012, 2017 and  2020 . The 2012 referendum was the first time the popular vote swung in statehood's favor.

She says the botched recovery effort led to preventable deaths.  August 29, 2018 -   Trump says the federal government's response to the disaster was ""fantastic.""  He says problems with the island's aging infrastructure created challenges for rescue workers. September 4, 2018 -  The  US Government Accountability Office releases a report  revealing that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was so overwhelmed with other storms by the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico that more than half of the workers it was deploying to disasters were known to be unqualified for the jobs they were doing in the field.

3,"Jennifer Lopez, Lin-Manuel Miranda And Others Call For Puerto Rico Aid After Hurricane Fiona",Marco Margaritoff,9/21/22,"When Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico on Sunday, it caused disastrous landslides and knocked out the power grid, leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity or water. As the hurricane moves on to batter the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean nations, celebrities with ties to the region are calling for immediate aid.“It is vitally important that we do what we can to help our families in Puerto Rico, and now the Dominican Republic,” Jennifer Lopez tweeted Tuesday. “I’m teaming up with the @hispanic_federation in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.”“These Hispanic Federation member organizations are on the ground assessing what the real needs of the people on the islands are,” added Lopez, who linked to the organization’s website. “Please support however you can.” Fiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on Monday night, and threatened to grow into a Category 4 storm Wednesday as it hit the Turks and Caicos Islands. Lopez, a Bronx-born New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, has long made efforts to support the neglected U.S. territory. The singer and actor donated $1 million to relief efforts after Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, hit the island in 2017, killing nearly 3,000 people. Puerto Rico was still recovering from Maria when Fiona hit. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration Sunday that ordered the federal government to provide the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which is an unincorporated territory of the U.S., with desperately needed assistance. Writer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico, called for more action to help the territory.“Much of Puerto Rico is without power due to Hurricane Fiona, which slammed into the island Sunday, dumping more than two feet of rain on some locations, causing mudslides and destroying homes,” Miranda wrote Tuesday in an op-ed in The Washington Post.Miranda’s piece concluded that both Hurricane Maria and Fiona reminded the world that Puerto Rico needed to solve its energy crisis. In 2021, the territory’s power utilities were taken over by a private company, Luma Energy, which said it was only equipped to handle Category 2 storms.Miranda also linked to the Hispanic Federation in a since-expired Instagram story.“Our kids call 3 places home: NY, [Puerto Rico] on their dad’s side, and [Dominican Republic] on their mom’s side,” Miranda wrote on Instagram Tuesday, per Parade. “Two of those places need our help right now.”Other celebrities, including actor Zoe Saldana and singers Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony urged people via social media to help out as well, according to Today.“My people from Puerto Rico, we are known for being strong and for our faith, and this will not be the exception!” Anthony wrote in the caption of an Instagram post. “My prayers are with you.”Martin, who lives in Puerto Rico, sent some encouragement to fellow residents.“Puerto Rico, once again we’re facing another hard blow from Mother Nature but, as we’ve done before, we are going to rise up with more strength and courage,” Martin said in Spanish in an Instagram video. “I know that together we’ll make our island shine like always.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
6,White House surges aid to hurricane-hit Puerto Rico on a haunting five-year anniversary,Stephen Collinson,9/20/22," Exactly five years after  Hurricane Maria  devastated Puerto Rico, yet  another catastrophic storm  is testing the federal government's capacity to mount a rapid response on an island exposed by its rudimentary infrastructure and vulnerability to climate change. The Biden White House is mobilizing a surge of assistance after  Hurricane Fiona  triggered lashing rains, severe floods, mudslides and blackouts. The echoes of 2017, when Maria caused more than a couple thousand deaths and left tens of billions of dollars in damage, are haunting local residents who are still trying to rebuild. Some whose homes were flooded out may face the prospect of starting again. ""It has been catastrophic rain that just won't stop,"" Robert Little, the Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinating officer on the island, told CNN's Erin Burnett, as the government's relief effort began to accelerate. ""The FEMA team has been leaning forward ever since we got the call to get down here."" The effort is building on an improved federal presence on the island since Maria, when the Trump administration was heavily criticized for a haphazard response and cheerleading for itself despite a tragedy that unfolded for months afterward as technicians struggled to restore the electrical grid. Although they often seem ignored in Washington, Puerto Ricans are US citizens living on a US island territory and are entitled to the federal government's assistance. Detailed damage assessments from this storm were still being compiled early Tuesday, but some residents said terrible flooding and mudslides were reminiscent of the devastation wrought by Maria.  The latest hurricane's arrival was especially cruel since many Puerto Ricans have had a rough time since 2017, struggling through grim chapters of storms, earthquakes, the pandemic and political turmoil. ""This is devastation over devastation,"" Carmen Yulín Cruz, the former mayor of San Juan, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro Pierluisi told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night that while most of the damage five years ago was caused by raging winds, the problem this time is the volume of rainfall. But while the power grid was repaired after Maria, it hasn't actually been improved, he said. Still Pierluisi added: ""We are much better prepared now than Puerto Rico was five years ago when we got hit by the Hurricane Maria. Just to give you an example, FEMA now has four warehouses located throughout Puerto Rico as opposed to one."" 'We are just halfway back' Millions of residents lost power as Fiona swept in. And after crossing the Dominican Republic, where it left a million customers without running water, it is now a Category Two hurricane expected to pass near Turks and Caicos Tuesday. At least two people in Puerto Rico died as a result of Fiona, a spokesman for Pierluisi told CNN. One was a 58-year-old man who was swept away by a river. Another man died when his generator caught fire as he tried to fill it with gasoline. Conditions are challenging because many medical centers were running on emergency power. Downed trees and power lines made it tough for patients to reach hospitals. The National Guard and emergency responders rescued about 1,000 people overnight into Monday as rain pelted the island. As  President Joe Biden  flew back from London and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, he called Pierluisi from Air Force One to vow strong support. He said 300 federal employees were already at work and that the number of support personnel would increase substantially as damage assessments were completed. The President promised that the federal team would stay as long as it took ""on the job to get it done,"" especially since many families were still rebuilding after the nightmare following Maria, a deadly Category Five storm that left many residents without power for months. Biden has directed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to travel to Puerto Rico Tuesday to meet local officials and citizens and assess urgent needs, the White House said. One man, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, bemoaned the impact of a storm that mercilessly undermined the rebuilding work of many Puerto Ricans. ""We are not all the way back; we are just halfway back. A lot of people, more than Maria, have lost their houses ... now because of the flooding,"" Gonzalez told CNN's Leyla Santiago. Emergency aid and political risks   The primary impulse from the White House and government emergency management agencies is always to alleviate casualties and loss of life from a storm. Then the clear-up and the rebuilding begins.  Every hurricane brings potential political pitfalls for presidential administrations. A delayed response or signs of indifference or misdirected aid can cause days of unflattering news coverage with the potential to stall political momentum, like that currently being enjoyed by Biden.   Ever since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast in 2005, and exposed a disastrous disconnect between the George W. Bush administration and local authorities, White House teams have been alert to the potential of a political backlash from poor handling of natural disasters. And they go out of their way to stress cooperation with local authorities. Or at least most of them do. Another hurricane hitting Puerto Rico has revived memories of ex-President Donald Trump's response to Maria,  when a video of him tossing paper towels  at an aid distribution center came to epitomize an often indifferent relief effort. The former President, however, awarded himself an A-plus for his response, despite the fact that more than  2,900 people , according to the Puerto Rican government, were later revealed to have died from the impact of the storm. Trump also reacted to criticism by lashing out at the media and local officials -- in a preview of how he would prioritize his political aspirations over sound disaster management during the coronavirus pandemic. Yulín Cruz, who frequently clashed heatedly with Trump in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, said that the people of Puerto Rico were collectively suffering post-traumatic stress disorder after successive disasters but that a strong federal government response could help alleviate their trauma. ""The federal government has a great opportunity here, (and) President Biden to show the world how things are done when they are done right,"" she said. After the immediate relief effort, Washington is likely to be called upon to offer more long-term aid to Puerto Rico residents for yet another rebuilding effort. But former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said that the lesson of previous natural disasters was that returning things to how they were would not work. ""The insanity of going back and putting it back the way it was isn't working,"" Fugate told CNN on Monday.  ""We've got to really focus on making the investments of where we're going to rebuild, how we're going to rebuild. Because the climate has changed -- how we've been rebuilding and developing hasn't caught up yet,"" he added. Although 2022 has been a relatively benign hurricane season so far, such storms feed on warm ocean water and moist air, and scientists say that the climate crisis is making them more powerful. The proportion of high-intensity hurricanes has increased due to warmer global temperatures, according to a UN climate report released last month. Scientists have also found that the storms are more likely to stall and lead to devastating rainfall and they last longer after making landfall.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/politics/white-house-hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-analysis/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiV_t_v08j6AhWbQzABHVR4DbgQFnoECAMQAg&usg=AOvVaw1WGOa87WU4E--aLo3qVtZs,CNN,Liberal
4,Puerto Rico Faces Long Recovery After Hurricane Fiona Causes Widespread Damage,Nick Visser,9/19/22,"Puerto Ricans were reeling after a powerful hurricane left more than 30 inches of rain in some places, causing widespread flooding, power outages and destruction akin to the devastating Hurricane Maria five years ago.Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said Monday that Hurricane Fiona had left “catastrophic” damage after battering urban areas with 80 mph winds this weekend. The storm knocked out power to the entire island by Sunday, and more than 750,000 people were without running water earlier Monday morning because water pumps lacked electric power.At least two people died during the storm, and more than 1,000 people were rescued across the island. Large areas were cut off to rescue crews by heavy flooding and debris, and thousands of people were in shelters Monday as rescue efforts continued.Puerto Rican officials said one man died trying to work a generator and another was swept away by floodwaters. There were reports of other fatalities, although the full extent of deaths and injuries won’t be reported until rescue crews are able to sift through damaged areas. The storm prompted a state of emergency in the Dominican Republic later Monday, and one fatality was reported there. But even though the fierce winds had left Puerto Rico, officials warned residents to stay cautious and remain indoors, pointing to severe flooding and ongoing evacuation efforts.The destruction resurfaces memories of Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm five years ago. Maria was the deadliest storm to sweep across the island, causing more than 3,000 deaths, leaving lasting damage and creating fierce tension between the territory and former President Donald Trump.Officials planned to modernize the Puerto Rican electric grid after Maria using federal funds, but the effort has been slow and power is still largely supplied via a patchwork system of old equipment. Billions of dollars in relief funding for recovery after that hurricane hasn’t been spent, and what has been allocated has largely gone to cleanup efforts rather than permanent works that could improve roads or utilities, The New York Times reported.Fiona was classified as a Category 1 hurricane but still caused widespread damage, underscoring the island’s vulnerability to fierce storms that experts say will only become more frequent due to climate change.President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration on Monday, ordering that federal resources be marshaled to help the island recover. The action allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster response and direct federal funding to the region.Biden also assured Pierluisi that the government would “substantially” increase the numbers of rescue workers beyond the 300 currently there.Power had been restored to about 100,000 people in some areas by Monday, but many parts of the U.S. territory — home to 3 million — were still without electricity, and officials warned it could be days before the lights came back on across the island.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
8,Hurricane Fiona causing 'catastrophic' flooding in Puerto Rico as the territory remains without power,"Dakin Andone, Haley Brink and Melissa Alonso",9/19/22," Hurricane Fiona made landfall along the extreme southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, near Punta Tocon, at 3:20 p.m. ET Sunday with winds of 85 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane is already causing catastrophic flooding as it moves just west of Puerto Rico and heads for the Dominican Republic, the center said in a 5 p.m. update. GET LIVE UPDATES The hurricane center is forecasting 12-18 inches of rainfall with a local maximum of 30 inches, particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico. Nearby in the norther and eastern parts of the Dominican Republic, 4-8 inches of rainfall is expected, with a local maximum of 12 inches possible along the northeast coast. ""These rains will produce life-threatening and catastrophic flash and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain,"" the hurricane center said. A flash flood emergency was issued for Sector San Felipe and Mosquito in Salinas County Sunday night as heavy rainfall pounded the region, where 10-15 inches of rain have already fallen, and another 2-4 inches are possible, according to the National Weather Service. The heavy rainfall in Salinas County has already led to multiple swift water rescues, and the Weather Service is urging people to ""move to higher ground now. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order."" All of Puerto Rico lost power earlier Sunday,  according to PowerOutage.us , as the Category 1 storm approached the islands. Many rivers on the eastern side of the territory are in moderate to major flood stage. One river in the southeast has risen over 12 feet in less than seven hours and is now over 25 feet, breaking the previous record of 24.79 feet set in 2017 during Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Fiona is the third of the  2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season  and forecast to become a major hurricane -- a storm of Category 3 or higher -- in about 48 hours, east of the Bahamas. Tropical storm conditions are expected to reach portions of the Dominican Republic within the next few hours and then in the Turks and Caicos Islands and portions of the southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday. The government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos and for the Southeastern Bahamas, including the Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Cay, the Inaguas, Mayaguana and the Ragged Islands. The storm's impacts have already been felt: At least one death has been reported in Basse-Terre in the French territory of Guadeloupe,  according to the vice president  of the territory's environmental agency, who said the capital had been devastated by flooding. Puerto Rico without power as hurricane lashes the islands Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi confirmed the territory-wide outage in a tweet, noting the entire electric system was out of service and officials have activated the proper protocols to work to restore power. The Authority of Electric Energy and LUMA Energy, which operates Puerto Rico's power grid, continue to work on the islandwide power outage affecting nearly 1.5 million customers, according to Pierluisi. The blackout -- which followed hours of progressively worsening power outages -- comes five years after Puerto Rico's power grid was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, leaving many residents without electricity for months. But officials have stressed it won't be like last time: Not long before the lights went out, Abner Gomez, head of public safety and crisis management at LUMA Energy, said utility authorities plan to repair and restore electricity with the help of local government agencies. ""This is not Maria, this hurricane will not be Maria,"" Gomez said. President Joe Biden on Sunday morning approved an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico, freeing up federal resources, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for emergency response and disaster relief efforts. There are more than 300 FEMA responders on the ground working ""hand and glove"" with the Commonwealth and their emergency management structure, Anne Bink, FEMA's Assistant Administrator for Response and Recovery, told CNN Sunday. ""Our heart goes out to the residents that are again going through another catastrophic event five years later,"" Bink said, noting Fiona has hit close to Hurricane Maria's five-year anniversary. Bink said FEMA's response is dual focused, including emergency generation and power missions for critical facilities and ensuring command and control structure is in place for things like search and rescue, emergency power generations and long-term needs once the island moves into recovery. Fiona's winds are expected to increase along the immediate coastline, while conditions are forecast to deteriorate throughout Sunday afternoon and evening, according to the National Weather Service's office in San Juan. Already, authorities have responded to one landslide: Emergency officials responded Saturday evening to a landslide around 8 p.m. ET at an apartment complex in Guaynabo,  according to fire and public safety officials . There were no initial reports of injuries. Around 120 shelters with 25,000 cots have been opened for those in need, the governor said. Classes Monday have been canceled and government workers -- save emergency workers -- should stay home, too. A hurricane warning -- indicating hurricane conditions are expected -- was issued for Puerto Rico, including the islands of Vieques and Culebra, and later expanded to include the eastern Dominican Republic from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo. The Dominican Republic's northern coast, from Cabo Frances Viejo west to Puerto Plata, were under a hurricane watch Sunday morning, meaning hurricane conditions are possible in the next 48 hours.

7,At least 2 dead in Puerto Rico after 'unbelievable' Hurricane Fiona,"Elizabeth Wolfe, Holly Yan and Melissa Alonso",9/19/22," At least two people have died in Puerto Rico because of  Hurricane Fiona , Gov. Pedro Pierluisi told CNN, as rescuers scrambled to save flooding victims.  A 58-year-old man died after being swept away by La Plata River behind his home in Comerío, and a man in his 30s died after attempting to fill his generator with gasoline while it was on, setting it on fire, according to Press Secretary Sheila Angleró-Mojica. The storm wiped out power to most of the island before crashing into the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Ricans who remember the wrath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 say Fiona might be more destructive. ""It's unbelievable,"" said Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a business owner in San Juan. ""A lot of people -- more than (during) Maria -- lost their houses now ... lost everything in their houses because of the flooding,"" Gonzalez told CNN's Leyla Santiago. ""Maria was tough winds. But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house. Gov. Pierluisi also told CNN Monday that damage on the island is mostly rain-related. By midday Monday, about 1,000 people in Puerto Rico had been rescued by emergency crews, said Maj. Gen. José Reyes, adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard.  The ""catastrophic rain that won't stop"" is ""the biggest challenge"" for responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency Coordingating Officer Robert Little told CNN's Erin Burnett Monday evening.  ""The first responders, the local responders, the responders of the government of Puerto Rico, are not able to get out and help those that needed or access the damage like they would like to do,"" he added. Intense rain was expected to produce more mudslides and catastrophic flooding through Monday night. One hundred first responders from New York will head to the US territory to help as soon as weather allows, Pierluisi said, adding that the governors of New Jersey and California have also pledged to send help.  Fiona made landfall Monday morning in the Dominican Republic after crossing onto land a day earlier in southwestern Puerto Rico. Still, Puerto Rico remains almost entirely under flash flood or flood warnings -- nearly five years to the day after  Hurricane Maria devastated  the territory. One area north of the city of Ponce reported over 2 feet of rain in 24 hours.  Rescues were underway Monday in the western Puerto Rican municipalities of Mayaguez and Hormigueros, officials said. The Guanajibo River in Hormigueros surpassed its previous record height set during Maria. Meanwhile, southern Puerto Rico can expect another 4 to 8 inches of rain or more early this week -- meaning Fiona will leave the island deluged with 12 to 30 inches of rain, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.  ""These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,"" the center said.  At least one death was reported in the  heavily-damaged city of Basse-Terre , the capitol of the French territory of Guadeloupe, the vice president of the territory's environmental agency said. Fiona could become a major hurricane by Wednesday, with  winds reaching 111 mph . That would make Fiona the first major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.  Massive power outages cripple Puerto Rico Just 115,000 out of 1.4 million customers on the island currently have power, Pierluisi said Monday evening. The entire island was in the dark early Monday,  PowerOutage.us  reported.  And it could be days before power is restored, the main power utility in Puerto Rico said Sunday, as daily high temperatures after Monday are forecast to reach the mid-80s to 90s. Several transmission line outages contributing to the blackout, LUMA Energy said. Power will be restored ""gradually,"" Pierluisi said in a Facebook post. Only 35% of customers are getting water services because water filtration plants are being impacted by the river flooding and excess rain, the governor said. By late Monday morning, a bit of good news from island's capital: The power system came back up for hospitals in San Juan's medical complex, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Dr. Carlos Mellado López said. The complex is the island's most important and stretches across 227 acres, according to the Health Administration of Puerto Rico. ""The power system at all the hospitals in the Medical Center Complex has been restored,"" Mellado tweeted Sunday night. ""Our patients are safe and receiving the medical care they need."" Fiona's latest path Intense rainfall will continue producing mudslides, landslides and catastrophic flooding across Puerto Rico through Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.  The hurricane slammed the Dominican Republic community of Boca de Yuma early Monday, whipping maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm knocked 59 aqueducts out of service, leaving more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic without running water, according to Jose Luis German Mejia, an emergency management official. At least 54 homes have been reported damaged so far, said Juan Manuel Mendez, the country's emergency management director of operations. Emergency officials have transported 789 people to safety, Mendez said at a storm briefing Monday. More than 500 people are housed in 29 shelters, he said.  Ten electric circuits are offline currently, but officials did not have an exact number of how many customers were without power.  ""This is still an emergency event,"" and the storm is still affecting the country, said Mejia.  Life-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding is forecast for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic through early Tuesday, the hurricane center said. Fiona could also dump 10 inches of rain in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to the center. GET LIVE UPDATES As Fiona moves away from the Dominican Republic's northern coast, it's expected to intensify as it moves north over warm water. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and Fiona is expected to impact the eastern Turks and Caicos on Tuesday morning.  A hurricane warning is in effect for Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening.  ""Fiona will continue turning northward and then northeastward this week, nearing Bermuda on Friday as a major hurricane,"" CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.  Yet another widespread calamity Power outages have become a familiar crisis for many who live in Puerto Rico. Just five months ago, residents suffered  another islandwide blackout  after a fire broke out in a power plant. Some parts of the island still bear the scars of Maria, which  inflicted catastrophic infrastructure damage ; it took almost a year for power to be restored across the island. Samuel Rivera and his mother Lourdes Rodriguez lived without power for about a year after Maria, Rivera told CNN. On Sunday morning, they lost power once again, conjuring up similar fears to those they had five years ago. They were also concerned a nearby river might overflow and trees surrounding their home could be felled by the powerful winds, they said.  Rushing waters easily  wiped away a bridge , carrying its structure downstream, one video of the dangerous flooding shows. Elsewhere in the city of Arecibo, quickly moving waters overtook large construction vehicles and entire trees as rain fell in sheets, another video by Samuel De Jesús shows. Many rivers on the eastern side of the island were at moderate to major flood stages Sunday afternoon, including one southeastern river which rose over 12 feet in less than seven hours. US President Joe Biden early Sunday approved an emergency declaration to provide federal assistance to disaster relief efforts. More than 300 FEMA emergency workers were on the ground to respond to the crisis, said Anne Bink, FEMA's associate administrator for Response and Recovery. ""Our heart goes out to the residents that again are going through another catastrophic event five years later,"" Bink said, nodding to Maria. This time, she said, FEMA plans to implement lessons learned from the 2017 crisis. ""We were much more prepared. We have four warehouses now strategically located throughout the island, which includes commodities, exponentially larger supplies than in the past,"" Bink said. ""We're proactively there -- and well ahead of any storm hitting -- to make sure that we are coordinating. And all of the planning efforts we undertake during those blue skies days can be brought to bear when the rain falls."" Biden told Gov. Pierluisi in a Tuesday call that he would ""ensure that the Federal team remains on the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week,"" a readout of the call said.

5,Hurricane Fiona Makes Landfall In Powerless Puerto Rico,Dánica Coto,9/18/22,"HAVANA (AP) — Hurricane Fiona struck Puerto Rico’s southwest coast on Sunday as it unleashed landslides, knocked the power grid out and ripped up asphalt from roads and flung the pieces around.Hundreds of people were evacuated or rescued across the island as floodwaters rose swiftly. Rushing rivers of brown water enveloped cars, first floors and even an airport runway in the island’s southern region.Forecasters said the storm threatened to dump “historic” levels of rain on Sunday and Monday, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in eastern and southern Puerto Rico.“The damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi.The storm washed away a bridge in the central mountain town of Utuado that police say was installed by the National Guard after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017. Large landslides also were reported, with water rushing down big slabs of broken asphalt and into gullies.Fiona was centered 45 miles (75 kilometers) south-southeast of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) on Sunday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It was moving to the west-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).Fiona struck on the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which hit Puerto Rico 33 years ago as a Category 3 storm.The storm’s clouds covered the entire island and tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 140 miles (220 kilometers) from Fiona’s center.U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in the U.S. territory as the eye of the storm approached the island’s southwest corner.Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution, said bad weather, including winds of 80 mph, had disrupted transmission lines, leading to “a blackout on all the island.”“Current weather conditions are extremely dangerous and are hindering our capacity to evaluate the complete situation,” it said, adding that it could take several days to fully restore power.Health centers were running on generators — and some of those had failed. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said crews rushed to repair generators at the Comprehensive Cancer Center, where several patients had to be evacuated.Fiona hit just two days before the anniversary of Hurricane Maria, a devastating Category 4 storm that struck on Sept. 20, 2017, destroying the island’s power grid and causing nearly 3,000 deaths.More than 3,000 homes still have only a blue tarp as a roof, and infrastructure remains weak, including the power grid. Outages remain common, and reconstruction started only recently.“I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” said Danny Hernández, who works in the capital of San Juan but planned to weather the storm with his parents and family in the western town of Mayaguez.He said the atmosphere was gloomy at the supermarket as he and others stocked up before the storm hit.“After Maria, we all experienced scarcity to some extent,” he said.The storm was forecast to pummel cities and towns along Puerto Rico’s southern coast that have not yet fully recovered from a string of strong earthquakes starting in late 2019.More than 1,000 people with some 80 pets had sought shelter across the island by Sunday night, the majority of them in the southern coast.Ada Vivian Román, a 21-year-old photography student, said the storm knocked down trees and fences in her hometown of Toa Alta.“I’m actually very anxious because it’s a really slow-moving hurricane and time does not move,” she said. “You look at the clock and it’s still the same hour.”She said she is also worried about whether the public transportation she relies on to get to her job at a public relations agency will be operating by the time she has to go back to the office.“But I know that I’m privileged compared with other families who are practically losing their homes because they are under water,” she said.In the southwest town of El Combate, hotel co-owner Tomás Rivera said he was prepared but worried about the “enormous” amount of rain he expected. He noted that a nearby wildlife refuge was eerily quiet before the storm hit.“There are thousands of birds here, and they are nowhere to be seen,” he said. “Even the birds have realized what is coming, and they’re preparing.”Rivera said his employees brought bedridden family members to the hotel, where he has stocked up on diesel, gasoline, food, water and ice, given how slowly the government responded after Hurricane Maria.“What we’ve done is prepared ourselves to depend as little as possible on the central government,” he said.Puerto Rico’s governor, Pierluisi, activated the National Guard as the Atlantic hurricane season’s sixth named storm approached.“What worries me most is the rain,” said forecaster Ernesto Morales with the National Weather Service in San Juan.Fiona was predicted to drop 12 to 16 inches (30 to 41 centimeters) of rain over eastern and southern Puerto Rico, with as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) in isolated spots. Morales noted that Hurricane Maria in 2017 had unleashed 40 inches (102 centimeters).Fiona was forecast to swipe the Dominican Republic on Monday and then northern Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands with the threat of heavy rain. It could threaten the far southern end of the Bahamas on Tuesday.A hurricane warning was posted for the Dominican Republic’s eastern coast from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo.Fiona previously battered the eastern Caribbean, killing one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe when floods washed his home away, officials said. The storm also damaged roads, uprooted trees and destroyed at least one bridge.St. Kitts and Nevis also reported flooding and downed trees, but announced its international airport would reopen on Sunday afternoon.In the eastern Pacific, Tropical Storm Madeline was forecast to cause heavy rains and flooding across parts of southwestern Mexico. The storm was centered about 160 miles (260 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo Corrientes on Sunday night, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph).",[],HuffPost,Liberal
9,Hurricane warning issued for Puerto Rico ahead of Tropical Storm Fiona,"Jason Hanna, Haley Brink and Christina Maxouris",9/17/22," Tropical Storm Fiona was beginning to whip the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico Saturday and may strike the latter as a hurricane Sunday, posing threats of flooding and mudslides forecasters say could be ""life-threatening."" A hurricane warning is in effect   for Puerto Rico, reflecting forecasters' belief it will strengthen to a hurricane -- with sustained winds of at least 74 mph -- by the time it's near or over the island Sunday afternoon. Hurricane watches, meanwhile, are in effect for the US Virgin Islands as well as parts of the Dominican Republic, the National Hurricane Center said.  Fiona, having pelted Guadeloupe and other northeastern Caribbean islands with heavy rain and winds Friday and early Saturday, was centered over the Caribbean about 75 miles south of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands as of 8 p.m. ET Saturday, the hurricane center  said . Parts of the Leeward Islands had seen ""very heavy rains and flooding,"" the hurricane center said Saturday, adding one station in the mountains in southwestern Guadeloupe had recently measured 19.85 inches of rainfall in 24 hours. And a station at Teagues Bay, St. Croix, reported a wind gust of 45 mph, the center said Saturday night. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph Saturday night, short of the 74 mph threshold for a  Category 1 hurricane , though strengthening is expected as the weekend progresses. Outer bands already were hitting the Virgin Islands and parts of Puerto Rico  since  Saturday afternoon, causing some showers and storms. Tropical storm conditions will continue across parts of the Leeward Islands and were beginning to reach the US and British Virgin Islands, from where they will spread westward, across Puerto Rico Saturday evening and into the night and then to parts of the Dominican Republic late Sunday, the hurricane center said. More than 19,000 homes and businesses were without power in Puerto Rico around 8:30 p.m. ET, according to  PowerOutage.us . The storm is expected to begin trekking in a northwestward motion Sunday through Tuesday, the hurricane center said. ""On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will move south of the U.S. Virgin Islands this evening, approach Puerto Rico tonight, and move across Puerto Rico by Sunday afternoon,"" it said. ""Fiona will then (move) offshore of the Dominican Republic on Monday and near or to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday."" Fiona is expected to become a hurricane before it reaches Puerto Rico's southern coast on Sunday, the hurricane center  added . And it will likely get stronger as it moves over the southwestern Atlantic Monday and Tuesday, the center added. One of Fiona's biggest threats is the rain it's expected to dump, especially   on Puerto Rico: generally 12-16 inches, with 20 inches in isolated areas there. ""These rains are likely to produce life-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly in portions of Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic,"" the hurricane center said. Hurricane conditions were expected on Puerto Rico on Sunday -- and are possible on the US Virgin Islands on Saturday night, the hurricane center said. Fiona became a tropical storm over the Atlantic on Wednesday before entering the eastern Caribbean on Friday. Expectations of heavy rain  Here is how much rain is expected in certain locations over the next few days, according to the hurricane center: • Leeward Islands, including Guadeloupe, and the northern Windward Islands : 2-4 inches on top of what they've already received.  • British and US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico : 4-6 inches, with isolated areas of 10 inches possible. • Puerto Rico : 12-16 inches, with isolated areas of 20 inches possible. • Dominican Republic : 4-8 inches, with isolated areas of 12 inches possible, particularly on the far eastern coast. • Haiti : 1-3 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches. • Turks and Caicos : 4-6 inches. A  flood watch  is in effect through Monday afternoon for the US Virgin Islands and parts of Puerto Rico, the National Weather Service said. Storm surges  -- ocean water pushed onto land -- of 1 to 3 feet also are possible for Puerto Rico's southern coast. Surges of 1 to 2 feet are possible for the US Virgin Islands, the hurricane center said. This is the first time in more than three years Puerto Rico has been issued a hurricane watch or warning. The last time was in August 2019, when Hurricane Dorian  passed the island  as a  Category 1  storm.  A few tropical storms have passed the island since then, but Dorian was the last storm at hurricane strength to pass within 50 miles, CNN meteorologists said.  Hurricane Maria  devastated Puerto Rico nearly five years ago  -- making landfall as a Category 4 storm on September 20, 2017, killing several thousand people and tearing apart an antiquated power grid, leaving more than one million people without electricity or running water for months.

6,Puerto Rico Braces For Landslides And Severe Flooding As Tropical Storm Fiona Approaches,DÁNICA COTO,9/17/22,"HAVANA (AP) — Tropical Storm Fiona threatened to dump up to 16 inches (41 centimeters) of rain in parts of Puerto Rico on Saturday as forecasters placed the U.S. territory under a hurricane watch and people braced for potential landslides, severe flooding and power outages.The storm was located 145 miles (230 kilometers) southeast of St. Croix Saturday morning with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). It was moving west at 13 mph (20 kph) on a path forecast to pass near Puerto Rico. Forecasters warned Fiona could be near hurricane strength when it passes through Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.Fiona is expected to swipe past the Dominican Republic on Sunday as a potential hurricane and Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Monday and Tuesday with the threat of extreme rain.Forecaster issued a hurricane watch for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Engaño westward to Cabo Caucedo and for the northern coast from Cabo Engaño westward to Puerto Plata.In Puerto Rico, authorities opened shelters and closed public beaches, theaters and museums as they urged people to remain indoors.“It’s time to activate your emergency plan and contact and help your relatives, especially elderly adults who live alone,” said Dr. Gloria Amador, who runs a nonprofit health organization in central Puerto Rico.At least one cruise ship visit and several flights to the island were canceled, while authorities in the eastern Caribbean islands canceled school and prohibited people from practicing aquatic sports as Fiona battered the region.In the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, authorities said they recorded wind gusts of up to 74 mph (120 kph), which would be considered a Category 1 hurricane. They also said 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain fell in three hours in the Gros Morne area.Fiona, which is the Atlantic hurricane season’s sixth named storm, was predicted to bring 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in eastern and southern Puerto Rico, with as much as 16 inches (41 centimeters) in isolated spots. Rains of 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) were forecast for the Dominican Republic, with up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) in places. Life-threatening surf also was possible from Fiona’s winds, forecasters said.Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lester in the eastern Pacific was on a projected path that could bring landfall near the Acapulco area on Mexico’s southwestern coast Saturday night.Lester was expected to remain a tropical storm until hitting the Mexican coast. Forecasters warned of potential dangers from heavy rains.The storm had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) late Friday. It was centered 110 miles (180 kilometers) southeast of Acapulco and moving moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).A tropical storm warning was up from Puerto Escondido to Zihuatanejo. The hurricane center said Lester could drop from 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain on the coasts of upper Guerrero state and Michoacan state, with isolated areas getting 12 inches (30 centimeters).",[],HuffPost,Liberal
10,"A Bad Bunny rant, an ex-governor in handcuffs and Puerto Rico still reels nearly five years after Hurricane Maria",Ray Sanchez,8/13/22," A week before former governor of Puerto Rico  Wanda Vázquez  was arrested by the FBI on bribery charges, pop superstar Bad Bunny riled up a throng of concertgoers in San Juan, calling out the current governor and the island's private electric company in an expletive-filled rant. ""We have a government over us that messes up our lives,"" the 28-year-old artist told the crowd, echoing the frustrations of many Puerto Ricans.  ""The country belongs to us and we are the ones in control,"" he said at the sold-out July 28 concert, where he performed ""El Apagón,"" or ""The Blackout"" -- an ode to the US territory's familiar power outages. His message sent the packed arena into a frenzy.  Nearly five years after  Hurricane Maria  devastated the island and three years after massive anti-government protests -- supported by Bad Bunny and other artists -- forced another former governor to step down, Puerto Rico teeters on the brink of yet another political crisis.  ""The government has turned its back on the people,"" said Francisco Amundaray Diaz, 33, a tourist guide in San Juan, the capital of the US commonwealth. ""Puerto Rico is a failed state. Our leaders are totally alienated from the real needs of the people.""  'We live in constant crisis' FBI agents arrested Vázquez August 4 at her home in the latest in a string of unrelated state and federal corruption cases against government officials, mayors, contractors and businesspeople across the island. In May, the mayors of two Puerto Rican towns were arrested on federal conspiracy charges for allegedly soliciting bribes and extortion, according to the  US Justice Department .  Two months later, in July, the former mayor of another town was sentenced to 30 months in prison for his involvement in a bribery scheme in which cash was exchanged for municipal contracts,  the DOJ said.   ""We live in constant crisis -- whether it's the electricity or the economy -- and the people in our government continue to enrich themselves at our expense,"" said Wendelys Ruiz Torres, 33, a home care attendant who lives with regular power outages and voltage reductions at home in the rural western town of Las Marías.   In Las Marías, nestled on the Cordillera Central mountain range, the slightest rainfall leads to blackouts, some lasting weeks, according to Ruiz. Other times the low voltage has ruined a TV, a microwave and a six-month-old laptop her son had bought with his savings. Occasionally, the house goes dark when the dryer starts. Her refrigerator makes strange sounds.  ""Before outages,"" Ruiz said, ""the bulbs flicker like Christmas lights. On and off. And then, blackness."" Feds: Bribery scheme rose to 'highest levels'  The arrest of Vázquez, 62, who was sworn in as the island's top elected official in August 2019 after disgraced former governor  Ricardo Rosselló  stepped down following massive protests, represented a new low for a US territory with a long history of graft and corruption. A onetime justice secretary and prosecutor whose job included combating corruption, Vázquez is the first former governor to face federal charges.  ""I am innocent and a great injustice has been committed against me, "" Vázquez told reporters after her release last week. ""I have committed no crime, no irregularity."" From December 2019 through June 2020, the former governor allegedly conspired in a scheme to finance her gubernatorial campaign, according to the DOJ. Vázquez allegedly received more than $300,000 from two businessmen to finance political consultants during her campaign, according to Stephen Muldrow, US Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico.  Vázquez and others are charged with conspiracy, federal programs bribery and honest services wire fraud. The ex-governor, who is named in three of seven counts in an indictment, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. ""The alleged bribery scheme rose to the highest levels of the Puerto Rican government, threatening public trust in our electoral processes and institutions of governance,""  Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. said in a statement. The bribes were allegedly paid in exchange for Vázquez making an appointment to the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions that benefited businessmen involved in the scheme, Muldrow said. The indictment alleged the owner of an international bank and his consultant -- a former FBI agent -- agreed to provide funding for Vázquez's campaign. In exchange, she would replace the island's top bank regulator with one of their choosing. At the time, the bank was the ""subject of an examination"" by the regulatory agency, federal prosecutors say. A onetime political consultant for Vázquez and the president of an international bank have pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme, according to the DOJ. Electric company shares 'frustration'  Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who was elected in November 2020 after defeating Vázquez in a primary election, said his administration has ""zero tolerance for corruption."" ""No one is above the law in Puerto Rico,"" Pierluisi, a member of the same pro-statehood party as Vázquez, said in Spanish via Twitter. Island politics are dominated by two political parties -- one favors the current commonwealth status, the other statehood.  When asked days after the concert about Bad Bunny's criticism of his government, Pierluisi lauded what he said were his administration's successes during the pandemic, in fighting crime and improvements to education and infrastructure, according to local media reports. He did not elaborate.  Pierluisi also said his government ""will continue to monitor"" LUMA Energy, the private Canadian-American consortium that began operating the island's power transmission and distribution system in June 2021.  Manuel Laboy, executive director of the island's  Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resilience , said Maria's path of destruction was unprecedented and that hundreds of reconstruction projects have already been funded for roads, bridges, hospitals and parks -- along with dozens since April to replace electrical poles and street lights, substations and transmission facilities.   ""I understand that frustration,"" he said Friday, referring to complaints about frequent blackouts. ""It's painful. It does affect lives. It does affect the quality of life. It does affect our capability to achieve economic growth and economic development...  But we're making progress and headed in the right direction."" For its part, LUMA Energy has maintained that it inherited a troubled electrical system decimated by decades of mismanagement and corruption, bankruptcy and, most recently, the force of Hurricane Maria. After Bad Bunny's concert rant, LUMA issued a statement saying it shared the frustration ""all our customers have with the reliability of Puerto Rico's electric system which has suffered from years - if not decades - of neglect and mismanagement. ""The 3,000 men and women of LUMA are working hard every single day to repair, rebuild and transform the electric grid for our 1.5 million customers,"" the statement said.  ""All Puerto Ricans, including Bad Bunny, deserve a world-class energy system and LUMA is working every day to build a brighter future."" Mario Hurtado, LUMA's chief regulatory affairs officer, said Friday that power outages are down 30% -- according to data presented to regulators -- since the company took over operations of the electrical system a little over a year ago.  ""We're just getting going,"" he said. ""We're aware that customers deserve better service... We have a lot more to do."" Puerto Rico's 'crisis generation' The latest political scandal comes at a time when many younger Puerto Ricans have only known a life of hardship. Years of economic recession and a ballooning debt crisis have resulted in shuttered schools, cuts in government services, layoffs and university tuition hikes.  In 2016, the US Congress created a board to oversee the island's finances. Recent tax incentives meant to bring outside money to the cash-strapped island have led to protests against an unwelcomed surge in gentrification.  In July 2019, the embattled Rosselló, 40, stepped down after weeks of protests over a series of scandals that included the  disclosure of crude, sexist and homophobic chat messages  between the governor and members of his inner circle. But the eventual downfall of his administration may have been set in motion by Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on the island on September 20, 2017, less than nine months after Rosselló took office. The Category 4 storm decimated the antiquated power grid, leaving more than a million people without electricity or running water for what would become months.   Problems with the distribution of food, water and other vital supplies were widespread. And it took the Rosselló administration nearly a year to admit the storm killed several thousand people -- not the dozens that had been the official line. Bad Bunny and other young Puerto Rican artists attended the July 2019 protests. He also helped write the song ""Afilando los Cuchillos,"" or ""Sharpening the Knives,"" which became an anthem for the movement. The song gave voice to the historic moment, touching on homophobia, government mismanagement and neglect, and homes left roofless by hurricanes.  At the July 28 concert in San Juan, Bad Bunny told the audience the island is ""the only place"" he performs where he needs to ""install like 15 industrial electrical generators because I can't trust Puerto Rico's electrical grid."" Mayra Velez Serrano, a professor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, said Bad Bunny's message resonates with ""a lot of young people, the crisis generation"" -- which has only known despair and uncertainty.  ""A generation that feels they don't have a future on this island. They keep moving away. They're highly educated. They can't find decent jobs. And what they see is their politicians just not doing their job and stealing money and engaging in corrupt acts."" Now, in the midst of new political turbulence, Puerto Rico's slow recovery and renewal continues, as Hurricane Maria's fifth anniversary gets closer.  ""The economic and social circumstances on the island are so precarious that people who may feel the need to take to the streets will not, because they're overwhelmed with their responsibilities, working two or three jobs to pay rent as the cost of living keeps rising,"" said Amundaray, the tour guide in San Juan.  ""But the energy of the people is increasing."" 'The frustration is there' Many Puerto Ricans were not surprised by Vázquez's downfall.  ""Year after year, it is the same thing,"" Ruiz, the home care attendant, said of government corruption and mismanagement.  ""We believed there would be change when they brought down a governor and look at what she's accused of doing. Wow,"" she said, referring to Rosselló and Vázquez.  In 2018, Vázquez came under fire for allegedly intervening on behalf of her daughter in a case stemming from a home theft. She faced charges of violating government ethics laws. But a judge later ruled there was insufficient evidence to arrest her. Vázquez's ties to Rosselló brought scrutiny during her brief tenure as governor under the ruling pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Critics accused her of failing to open investigations against members of her own party, particularly Rosselló and his administration's handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. In January 2020, Puerto Ricans poured onto the streets of San Juan calling for her resignation after Maria relief   supplies were found in a warehouse in the city of Ponce, more than two years after the storm. Later that year, Puerto Rican officials confirmed Vázquez was being investigated for suspicion of mishandling resources meant to mitigate earthquake damage on the island.  ""The frustration is there,"" said Carlos Suárez, who teaches at the  University of Florida's Center for Latin American Studies  and was in Puerto Rico last weekend for the funeral of his grandmother. ""The question is what will be the spark needed to turn this moment to political mobilization where people take to the streets.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/13/americas/puerto-rico-corruption-bad-bunny-rant/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiV_t_v08j6AhWbQzABHVR4DbgQFnoECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw0FdGB_bUa1DkmFDaAPONXR,CNN,Liberal
11,"Former Puerto Rico governor Wanda Vázquez charged with bribery, US Justice Department says","Rafy Rivera, Melissa Alonso and Ray Sanchez",8/4/22," Former Puerto Rico governor  Wanda Vázquez  was arrested Thursday in San Juan on bribery charges connected to the financing of her 2020 campaign, the US Justice Department says.  Vázquez is the first former governor to face federal charges. And the political scandal is the latest to shake an island still recovering nearly five years after the devastation wrought by  Hurricane Maria.  One of her attorneys, Peter John Porrata, told CNN Vazquez will plead not guilty to the charges. She was released on bond after a brief hearing Thursday.  ""I am innocent and a great injustice has been committed, "" Vázquez told reporters after her release. ""I have committed no crime."" A onetime political consultant for Vázquez and the president of an international bank have pleaded guilty to participating in the bribery scheme, according to a DOJ statement. A former FBI agent and the owner of the international bank that operated in San Juan also participated in the alleged scheme, federal officials say.  From December 2019 through June 2020, the 62-year-old former governor allegedly conspired in a scheme to finance her gubernatorial campaign, according to the DOJ.  Vázquez allegedly received more than $300,000 from two businessmen to finance political consultants during her campaign, Stephen Muldrow, US Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico, told reporters Thursday.  Vazquez and others are charged with conspiracy, federal programs bribery and honest services wire fraud.  The ex-governor, who is named in three of seven counts in an indictment, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.  ""The alleged bribery scheme rose to the highest levels of the Puerto Rican government, threatening public trust in our electoral processes and institutions of governance,"" Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. said in a statement.  The bribes were allegedly paid in exchange for Vázquez making an appointment to the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions that benefited businessmen involved in the scheme, Muldrow said. The indictment alleged the owner of the international bank and his consultant -- the former FBI agent -- agreed to provide funding for Vázquez's campaign in exchange for her replacing the island's top bank regulator with one of their choosing. At the time, the bank was the ""subject of an examination"" by the regulatory agency, federal prosecutors say.  Muldrow said the island's current governor, who defeated Vázquez in an election, was not involved in the scheme.  A former Secretary of Justice, Vázquez served as governor of the US territory from 2019 to 2021. Her appointment came after disgraced former governor Ricardo Rosselló was forced to step down following islandwide protests against his government.  She became Secretary of Justice in January 2017 -- with a mandate that included fighting corruption on the island -- and was an ally of Rosselló.  In 2018, Vazquez came under fire for allegedly intervening on behalf of her daughter in a case stemming from a home theft. She faced charges of violating government ethics laws. But a judge later ruled there was insufficient evidence to arrest her. Arrest affects 'the confidence of our people'  Vázquez's brief tenure as governor was contentious. Her ties to the disgraced former governor brought scrutiny. Critics accused her of failing to open investigations against members of her own party, particularly Rosselló and his administration's handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. In January 2020, Puerto Ricans poured onto the streets of San Juan calling for her resignation after Hurricane Maria supplies were found in a warehouse in the city of Ponce, more than two years after the storm.   Later that year, Puerto Rican officials confirmed Vásquez was being investigated for suspicion of mishandling resources meant to mitigate earthquake damage on the island.  Mayra Velez Serrano, a professor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, said Thursday that many people on the island were shocked at the arrest but not entirely surprised.  ""That the former Justice Secretary ...  and ex-governor, who is married to a judge, that she was involved in anything like this and that she was arrested is still shocking,"" Velez said. ""This continues to undermine the public's confidence in the political system and their politicians and the two main parties."" Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who was elected governor after defeating Vásquez in a primary election, said Thursday, ""Under my administration there is zero tolerance for corruption.""  ""Today we see once again that no one is above the law in Puerto Rico,"" Pierluisi, a member of the same pro-commonwealth party as Vásquez, said in Spanish via Twitter.  The arrest ""certainly affects and lacerates the confidence of our people,"" the governor said.   ""I reiterate that in my administration we will continue to have a common front with the federal authorities against anyone who commits an improper act,"" said the governor.  ""Wherever it comes from and whoever it may implicate, as well as promoting initiatives and following up on the bills that I have presented to combat corruption,"" he said.  In 2019, Rosselló handpicked Pierluisi as his successor.  His  short-lived tenure came to an end  after just five days when Puerto Rico's Supreme Court declared his governorship unconstitutional.  Vázquez was subsequently sworn in. ""In light of the decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, I must step aside and support the Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico,"" Pierluisi had said in a statement at the time. Pierluisi then won the election for the seat in November 2020.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/americas/puerto-rico-wanda-vazquez-governor-arrested/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiciN311Mj6AhXqTjABHXMEAT44ChAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw0GuxOv1VaygRo_IeZFxD73,CNN,Liberal
7,"How To Take The Ultimate Vacation In Rincón, Puerto Rico",HuffPost Staff,5/30/22,"Take A Break is your ultimate guide to the perfect trips to recharge, rediscover yourself and your relationships, and reengage with the world. We’ll cover shopping stops, great bars, restaurants worth your money, photo opportunities, memorable drives and experiences, and other important details you need before you book.Below, we chat with HuffPost reporter Sarah Ruiz-Grossman about why you’ll want to put Rincón, Puerto Rico on your bucket list.What drew you to Rincón as a place to visit or explore?My college roommate Gabriela Hardy is boricua and lives in Rincón with her partner and daughters. Rincón is a small town on the westernmost tip of Puerto Rico, with intimate, palm-tree-lined beaches, the best sunsets, no big hotels, and lots of taco trucks and restaurants overlooking the water. People especially love to surf there, and it has a laid-back, nature-filled vibe.What are the best times of year to visit?The best months, in my opinion, are winter ― November through April ― after the hurricane season but before the really hot and humid months of summer. You can count on around 85-degree days, balmy 75-degree nights, a lot of sun, and the occasional tropical shower. What’s your best tip for getting there? How can you make the travel as stress-free as possible?The easiest way there is to fly into Aguadilla airport and rent a car, driving the 40 minutes or so to Rincón. In Rincón, it’s pretty necessary to have a car as you don’t have easy-access public transport or rideshares. If you’re planning to stay on the island a week or more, you can fly into San Juan and spend a couple days there before driving the 2.5 hours to Rincón. Where do you recommend staying when you go?Rincón doesn’t have massive hotels, which is a big part of its charm. It’s more about boutique hotels and Airbnbs. Tres Sirenas is a gorgeous oceanside bed and breakfast, Fisheye View is a rental up in the hills with a nice pool, and Casa en lo Alto is an Airbnb house with great views and a screened-in porch.What are your go-to restaurants or foods to eat while you’re there?Rincón is full of great food ― make sure to get in lots of fish tacos, mofongo and açai bowls. Jack’s Shack is the best spot to grab tacos, Cosecha for vegan-friendly lunch, Cafe 2 Go for iced coffee and açai bowls, and Casa Isleña for sunset dinner with a view. What bars or entertainment spots do you make sure to hit? What’s good to drink there or what else should people know?There’s not a huge going-out scene in Rincón, but there are plenty of fun bars to grab drinks at. The Beach House is a bar and grill that overlooks the ocean, La Copa Llena also has great views and a bit of a fancier vibe, Tamboo serves drinks right on the beach, and The English Rose has a hilltop brunch with a mean bloody mary. What are your favorite shops, and what do you look for when you’re there?Rincón has an amazing yoga studio called Centro La Paz that has classes, massages and wellness products. Karibe Kombucha is a must-stop for locally made kombucha and yummy superfood blends to take home and add to your morning coffee. Puntas Surf Shop has great beginner surf lessons with rad bathing suits and water sports gear.What’s your single favorite spot to go for photos and why?Maria’s Beach is the perfect, palm-tree-lined beach with few people around and surfers always in the water ― and it serves up a gorgeous sunset. What tourist attraction should people skip and what should they do instead?You should definitely drive the 50 minutes to Gozalandia, which has beautiful wood-planked trails to several waterfalls you can swim in. Where do you feel the most relaxed, calm or happy?Domes Beach tends to have bigger waves and a perfect sunset, and if you come in the afternoon, you’re almost guaranteed to see surfers riding the swell — a great place to chill.What scenic spots do you recommend checking out?Survival Beach is a 45-minute drive from Rincón. When you park at Surfer’s Beach in Aguadilla, you can take a 20- to 30-minute trail through the jungle to get to Survival Beach, a long, picturesque beach with small waves and tide pools that you can only get to on foot, almost guaranteeing you’ll have most of the shore to yourself.What’s one thing you make sure to pack if you’re going, and why?Goggles! When you swim at the local beaches, like Steps Beach, take time to look down in the water and you’re sure to see colorful fish and even the occasional turtle.What are some specific planning tips to know before you go so you’re not stressed?People in Rincón are really good about wearing masks in public spaces to protect each other from the COVID-19 virus ― it’s a small town where local residents know each other intimately and interact often, so it’s especially important to respect coronavirus guidelines and get fully vaccinated and boosted before traveling, and to mask up while there. What surprised you about Rincón when you went the first time?I was surprised by just how laid-back the town is. It’s not big, so you get a handle on the layout and the go-to places within a few days, and it makes for a very relaxed time.Anything else visitors should know?Rincón, like much of Puerto Rico, is fighting to keep big developers from buying out waterfront properties on public shorelines that drive up housing prices and make the beaches less accessible to all. Be sure to read up on local activists’ fight to preserve the beaches for all and keep the shorelines from environmental destruction. ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
12,Power has been restored to much of Puerto Rico following an island-wide outage,Melissa Alonso and Aya Elamroussi,4/11/22," Power has been restored to 99.7% of LUMA Energy customers in Puerto Rico, the utility said Sunday, after hundreds of thousands had been  in the dark  since a fire at a power plant Wednesday evening.  ""Electric service has been restored to nearly 1.5 million customers as of Sunday morning,"" LUMA said in a  statement  on its website. Crews are continuing their work ""to stabilize the grid and reduce the future risk of intermittent power outages,"" the statement said. The outage began as an island-wide blackout that closed schools and courts for days and caused other interruptions for the US territory's 3.2 million residents. LUMA  said late Saturday  that power had been restored to 1.3 million customers and full restoration was possible by Sunday. The massive outage began around 8:45 p.m. Wednesday when an unspecified failure led to a fire at the Costa Sur Substation, said Kevin Acevedo, vice president of LUMA Energy. Firefighters have since extinguished the flames at the facility outside the town of Guayanilla on the southwest coast. The exact cause wasn't immediately known, the  utility has said . Initially, all customers lost power ""because all the generating units went offline,"" according to Josué Colón, the island's lead telecommunications and infrastructure engineer.  In addition to power disruptions, the outage also caused interrupted water service to tens of thousands of homes and businesses,  said  Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who cited the island's aqueducts and sewers authority. Schools across the island also canceled classes for students on Thursday and Friday, though principals, custodians and school cafeteria employees were told to report to work Friday, the island's education department said. By Thursday afternoon, all hospitals were operational either through power restoration or generators, Secretary of the Interior Noelia García Bardales said.  Cause of fire is under investigation As the lights are turning on in the remaining homes and businesses, little is known about what caused the fire that plunged the island into darkness.  ""We understand that many are asking how and why such a large outage happened, LUMA President and CEO Wayne Stensby said in the Sunday statement. ""We have begun the detailed investigation into this event and will be fully transparent with our customers, regulators, and the legislature with our findings to determine what actions must be taken to reduce the threat of such large outages."" The utility said Thursday the ""massive island-wide blackout"" might have been ""caused by a circuit breaker failure"" at the Costa Sur plant. Acevedo, LUMA's vice president, said the cause of the fire remains under investigation, noting that the equipment was up to date on maintenance inspections. LUMA is a joint venture of Quanta Services and the Canadian energy company ATCO, which the Puerto Rican government chose to take over the operation of the power grid from its previous public electric utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. LUMA has been in charge of the power grid  since June 1 . CNN's Jason Hanna, Rafy Rivera and Michelle Watson contributed to this report.

13,Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rico's homes and businesses still without power after outage,Melissa Alonso and Jason Hanna,4/9/22," Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico still were without power Saturday, more than two days after the start of an  island-wide outage  that began with a fire at a power plant. Power has been restored to more than 1 million of the island's roughly 1.5 million utility customers, the territory's grid operator  said  early Saturday. That leaves about 500,000 homes and businesses without power in an outage that closed schools for two days and caused other interruptions for Puerto Rico's 3.2 million residents. Power grid operator LUMA Energy was unable to commit to a timeline for the restoration of power to every customer, according to an announcement on its website. ""We are continuing to make progress in restoration but due to extensive damage at Costa Sur Substation, we are not in position to provide an estimate of full restoration at this time,""  the energy provider said . An unspecified failure led to a fire at the plant outside the town of Guayanilla on the southwest coast around 8:45 p.m. Wednesday, cutting power across Puerto Rico, Kevin Acevedo, vice president of LUMA Energy, has said. Firefighters have since extinguished the flames. All customers lost power initially, Josue Colon, Puerto Rico's lead telecommunications and infrastructure engineer, told reporters Thursday, ""because all the generating units went offline.""  The exact cause wasn't immediately known, the  utility has said . ""Every single (piece of) equipment (at the plant's switchyard) needs to be inspected and tested to make sure that when it's back in service, we can restore power for customers reliably and safely,"" Shay Bahramirad, LUMA Energy's senior vice president of engineering and asset management, told reporters in San Juan on Friday. The power outage also has interrupted water service to tens of thousands of homes and businesses, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi  said , citing the island's aqueducts and sewers authority. Puerto Rico canceled classes Friday for students for a second straight day. But school principals, custodians, and school cafeteria employees still were told to report to work Friday, the island's education department  said .    The island's courts also were closed because of the outage, though some court services will be available online for urgent matters like mental health and restraining orders, the territory's judicial system  said . All hospitals were operational by Thursday afternoon, whether their power was restored or they were operating via a generator, according to Secretary of the Interior Noelia García Bardales. Replacement power plant parts ordered, official says Early Thursday,  the utility said  the ""massive island-wide blackout"" might have been ""caused by a circuit breaker failure"" at the Costa Sur plant.  Firefighters extinguished flames that affected two substations at the plant, the Bureau of Puerto Rico Fire Departments said Wednesday.  The cause of the fire is being investigated, Acevedo said Thursday morning, adding that the equipment was up to date on maintenance inspections.

14,Puerto Rico crews scramble to restore power after island-wide outage,Melissa Alonso and Jason Hanna,4/8/22," Electric service restoration efforts were still underway Thursday evening in Puerto Rico, a utility company said, a day after the start of an island-wide outage that left many people in the dark overnight and prompted school cancellations and other interruptions across the  US territory .  Most customers on the island of about 3.2 million residents still were without power Thursday, officials said. By day's end, at least 380,200 LUMA customers have had their power restored as of 10 p.m. local time, LUMA Energy said in a  statement  on its Twitter account.  ""Given the massive size of the outage, its scope and the necessity to operate in safety, we are informing our customers that the restoration will continue through Thursday night and into Friday,"" the company said in the statement.

Puerto Rico's Department of Education canceled classes Friday for students, but ""school principals, custodians, and school cafeteria employees must report to the campuses starting at 10:00 am,"" the department said in a  tweet .    Pierluisi suspended school classes Thursday across the island and told nonessential government workers to stay home. Only government workers ""with essential and emergency functions will have to report to work,""  Pierluisi said  in a news release. Hospital's intensive care floor temporarily lost power The intensive care floor at Mayagüez Medical Center, on the island's west coast, temporarily was without power because of backup generator issues, prompting LUMA to especially focus on restoring power there, officials said.  Power eventually was restored at the location, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Carlos Mellado López  said on Twitter .  Four patients on that floor were intubated, and would have been moved to a floor with electricity had service not been restored quickly, officials said earlier.  All hospitals were operational by Thursday afternoon, whether their power was restored or they were operating via a generator, according to Secretary of the Interior Noelia García Bardales. ""All hospitals are operating without any setbacks. All elective surgeries were performed today without inconveniences. All dialysis services are being performed without delays."", said García Bardales. Puerto Rico's airports were operational, and no flight cancellations were reported due to the outage, according to officials. Police have a plan to help circulate traffic with the lights out, but ""we ask for cooperation from drivers on the roads,"" Pierluisi said. Replacement power plant parts ordered, official says Early Thursday,  the utility said  the ""massive island-wide blackout"" might have been ""caused by a circuit breaker failure"" at the Costa Sur plant.

16,Why this Caribbean archipelago is a prime spot to visit next,Will McGough,2/3/22," Perhaps no travel destination in the world has had a rougher go of things these past few years than Puerto Rico.In addition to the pandemic, the Caribbean archipelago has faced an eye-popping string of disasters in the past half-decade.They include the Zika epidemic in 2016, Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, and then a 6.4-magnitude earthquake in early 2020, just weeks before Covid-19 started forcing the world into lockdown.Though it's not   out of the woods yet, what's amazing is how well Puerto Rico has responded -- and rebounded. Despite all its challenges, Puerto Rico set a  tourism record in 2021 , and it remains a prime place to visit in 2022. The islands -- the main island of Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques and dozens of cays and islets -- boast one of the  highest vaccination rates  of any US territory or state, and Puerto Rico's tourism industry is running on all cylinders, with revived natural experiences, rejuvenated local movements and a special historical celebration to tie it all together moving forward.  ""The resiliency of Puerto Rico and the attitude that everyone has here has always been that we were going to come back stronger,"" said Sharilyn Toko, general manager at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan.High vaccination rate + easy travel from the USWhile Puerto Rico has had one of the lowest case rates of any US territory or state, it hasn't escaped Omicron. A massive spike in new cases that peaked in early January  has plunged precipitously,  and a spike in deaths is heading down.For Americans, Puerto Rico will be an especially attractive destination in the coming months. No passport is required, it's a short trip from the Eastern Seaboard, and testing requirements for vaccinated travelers have just been lifted. As of February 2, vaccinated domestic travelers don't need the previously required pre-travel test to enter Puerto Rico. Unvaccinated domestic travelers with a negative test result can bypass quarantine. (For international visitors, the US entry requirements apply: visitors must be vaccinated and have a negative Covid-19 test result.)Here's the latest on the rules  for domestic and international travelers. With  more than 82% of the eligible population fully vaccinated , the destination has one of the highest US vaccination rates, making it safer for all visitors. A revived 'support local' movementThough relaxing at a beach resort is a draw for many visitors to Puerto Rico, local businesses need support now more than ever. As 2022 gets started, there's a new wave of family and community-run organizations that combine cultural education and tourism. ""We want to encourage people visiting Puerto Rico to look at new ways of immersing in and experiencing the island,"" said Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez, inventor of  La Borinqueña , a patriotic, female superhero comic inspired by mythology and mysticism as well the social, political and environmental issues of Puerto Rico. ""Not just doing a weekend at a closed-off resort, but actually engaging the island in a way that's supporting sustainable work and addressing a lot of the inequities that exist in Puerto Rico,"" Miranda-Rodriguez said. In response to Hurricane Maria, Miranda-Rodriguez started the La Borinqueña Grants Program in 2018 to support nonprofits in Puerto Rico dealing with child development, arts, women's health, environmental justice and sustainable farming. Many of the organizations supported by the program allow visitors to interact and engage. One example is the  Piñones Cultural and Ecotourism Center,  located 30 minutes east of San Juan in Loiza, a town that's home to the majority of Puerto Rico's Afro-Puerto Rican population. The center offers cultural and ecotourism opportunities, including Bomba workshops, musical performances and bike and kayak tours to explore the nearby Piñones State Forest and Nature Reserve. These experiences will connect you directly with the local people, and all proceeds go to supporting their social improvement and economic development in Loiza. Foodies looking for locally sourced grub should keep an eye on the soon-to-open  Concina  at El Departmento de la Comida, a nonprofit that supports and advocates for local farmers. Otherwise, consider hopping on a food tour to help you target local, in-need restaurants, which are still emerging from the pandemic. ""We highlight mom and pop restaurants that are producing something really nice and specific and unique, and it's all local Puerto Rican food and drink,"" said Leslie Padro, owner of  Flavors Food Tours  in San Juan. Got rum on the brain? Who could blame you. Instead of following the crowd to Bacardi, head over to the new  San Juan Distillers  in the countryside west of San Juan, a family-run, 14-acre farm producing agricole rum. They recently celebrated their grand opening after it was delayed when Hurricane Maria knocked out their power for eight months and destroyed much of their crop. Now and then: San Juan celebrates 500 years San Juan celebrated its  500th anniversary  in 2021, and you can continue the celebration with some historical experiences and events running through June of 2022. The free-of-charge special anniversary walking tour,  Ruta de Los 500 Años , explores Old San Juan's founding and visits its most historic places.Down south, the city of Ponce -- founded in 1692 and named after Juan Ponce de León's great-grandson, Loíza Ponce de León -- traces history through its quality museums, such as the  Museum of Puerto Rican Music  and the  Ponce Museum of Art . (Be sure to check before going as the museums have been temporarily closed).History doesn't have to be dry, either. The recently renovated  Caribe Hilton , built in 1946 as the first Hilton outside the continental US, is the birthplace of the piña colada. The original recipe, concocted back in 1954, is printed on the wall, along with a tribute to the bartender who invented it. Bioluminescent bays are brighter than everPaddling or swimming in Puerto Rico's three bioluminescent bays has long been one of its most fascinating and exciting outdoor adventures. Two are on the main island, La Parguera in Lajas and Laguna Grande in Fajardo, and one, Mosquito Bay, is on nearby Vieques Island.Right now, tour operators say the experience is better than anytime in recent memory. A bay becomes bioluminescent when large quantities of organisms (dinoflagellates) grow and congregate together in one area. When stimulated by movement, a reaction occurs that causes onlookers to see a bright, blue-green ""glow."" Like many natural areas around the world, these bays saw reduced activity during the pandemic. Tourism was also shut down in 2017 during the hurricanes, allowing the dinoflagellates to thrive in higher concentrations. ""It looks beautiful right now,"" said Captain Kiko Doitteau, president of Paradise Scuba & Snorkeling Center, referring to its vibrancy. ""It's like being in the 'Avatar' movie.""For the best experience, try to visit on a night when the moon is small or blocked by clouds. The darker it is, the more vibrant the glow will appear.

17,Puerto Rico gets green light to end five-year bankruptcy,Reuters,1/18/22,"The judge overseeing Puerto Rico's nearly five-year-long debt restructuring process has approved a debt adjustment plan that is intended to revitalize the commonwealth's economy and reduce its $135 billion in liabilities. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain approved the plan in an order filed on Tuesday, bringing nearly half a decade of litigation over Puerto Rico's financial standing to a close. Puerto Rico filed for protection under a bankruptcy-like law, known as Title III, in May 2017. Its $135 billion in liabilities included more than $55 billion in underfunded pension obligations. The debt adjustment plan, proposed by a federally appointed financial oversight board, incorporates settlements among an array of creditors and aims to encourage new investments to aid the island's economy. The plan reduces $33 billion in bond debt to $7 billion and cuts overall debt by 80%, according to the board. The case has racked up approximately $1 billion in legal fees. Swain noted in Tuesday's decision that the plan has ""broad but not universal support,"" with many public workers and retirees, among others, taking issue with certain aspects. The oversight board has said that under the plan, most government retirees are still in line to receive their full pensions at their current levels. However, the plan terminates defined-benefit retirement programs that cover tens of thousands of teachers and judges. The board said in a statement on Tuesday that it welcomed Swain's decision but that the commonwealth ""needs to continue to reform itself to ensure a prosperous future."" Puerto Rico piled up unsustainable levels of debt in the years leading up to 2017. In 2016, the federal government enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, which created a process for the territory to restructure its debt. The commonwealth's troubles reached new levels just a few months after it filed for Title III protection as Hurricane Maria ravaged the island, killing about 3,000 people.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/business/puerto-rico-bankruptcy/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3ic6x3sj6AhXCSTABHV8GB-s4eBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0WNYU1qlH9KzH-XJJ4x0EP,CNN,Liberal
18,How Puerto Rico became the most vaccinated place in America,Ray Sanchez,10/24/21," A member of a scientific coalition advising Puerto Rico's government on the coronavirus pandemic recently joked about the island's high Covid-19 vaccination rate, attributing it to the proliferation of drug store chains on the island. ""There is a Walgreens on like every corner,"" said Rafael Irizzary, a professor of biostatistics at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Everywhere you go, they have everything you need. Rum. Coffee. You get your fireworks and then you go get a vaccine."" Irizzary was only half joking about vaccination rates and Puerto Rico's more than 100 Walgreens outlets.  The Caribbean island -- in recent years pummeled by  deadly hurricanes , rocked by  earthquakes , beset by  political unrest  and saddled by  debt  -- has quietly managed to outpace even  New England states with the highest vaccination rates  in the country.    ""All those emergencies and collective trauma primed Puerto Rico and the leadership, the scientific community, the healthcare community,"" said Daniel Colón Ramos, a Yale medical school professor who presides over the coronavirus coalition advising the government. ""There was a sense of urgency. A lot of people that I have worked with, their attitude was like: Not on my watch. Not again."" Puerto Rico has fully vaccinated just over 73% of its 3.3 million residents, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  That's more than 2.3 million people.   The island has the highest rate of total vaccine doses administered, with 154,563 per 100,000 people. It had administered 4.9 million doses as of Friday, according to the CDC.  On the mainland, Vermont leads with 70.8% of the population fully vaccinated, followed by Connecticut at 70.2% and Maine at 70%, according to the CDC, which added that just over  57% of the total US population  was fully vaccinated as of Friday. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health,  wrote on Twitter  that Puerto Rico's ""fabulous"" vaccination efforts have ""gotten way too little attention.""   ""Best I can tell, they've done this largely by not tying vaccines to politics,"" Jha wrote last weekend. ""They pay less attention to mainland politics. All their political parties actively support vaccinations. And generally, political [identity] & vaccinations are not intermixed."" Not only is Puerto Rico poor compared to much of the mainland, Jha noted, but it also has a larger population than 21 states. It's about ""5 times bigger"" than Vermont, he wrote. The poverty rate on the island was about 43% in 2018, compared to 13% at the national level and more than double Mississippi's 19.7%, according to the  US Census Bureau.   'A lot of saved lives' ""It represents a lot of saved lives,"" Colón Ramos said of the island's  vaccination success. ""It's really about the fact there are hundreds of people -- if not thousands -- right now walking around somewhere in Puerto Rico and they wouldn't be there if it wasn't for these efforts."" Dr. Iris Cardona, chief medical officer of the island's health department, attributed the success to teamwork by the scientific community, the private sector, government agencies, medical associations and schools, the National Guard and religious and municipal leadership.  ""It's a collaborative exercise,"" said Cardona, who is overseeing the vaccination program. ""Given the difficulties that the whole world knows Puerto Rico has endured in the last five years -- hurricanes, earthquakes, political and fiscal crises -- the Puerto Rican people at all levels have cooperated.""  That cooperation has included both vaccine education programs and vaccination events.  Throughout the pandemic, the island's government has implemented lockdowns and other restrictions, issued mask and vaccination mandates and put in place stringent indoor dining and social distancing rules, according to members of the Covid-19 coalition.  ""In the cultural context of Puerto Rico, the social distancing is not something that comes easy to us as Puerto Ricans -- we want to be close,"" Colón Ramos said. ""But people have managed to navigate that very well.""  'Coherent message ... based on scientific evidence' While some states have fiercely resisted Covid-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates, the US territory has not.  ""Right now the legislature is controlled by one party, the governorship is controlled by another party, but in spite of those differences... wanting to save lives during the pandemic was never politicized in Puerto Rico,"" Colón Ramos said.  ""Difficult decisions were made and criticized,"" he said. ""But, for example, mask mandates were never really politicized. The importance of vaccination was never made into a political issue. It helped to send a coherent message that was based on scientific evidence."" Puerto Rico has had at least 151,245 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 3,219 reported deaths during the pandemic, according to the  island's health department.   Connecticut , which is about the same size as Puerto Rico, has had more than 400,000 Covid-19 cases and 8,721 deaths. Dr. Víctor Ramos, a pediatrician and president of the island's Association of Physicians and Surgeons, said mass vaccination centers were set up by the National Guard in shopping malls throughout the island. There were door-to-door vaccination events in remote rural towns, where shots were administered in homes, particularly to the elderly and bedridden.  ""We will go wherever we need to go to vaccinate people,"" Ramos said. ""After (Hurricane) Maria many people were holed up in remote towns and we had to get out there to help them. We're doing the same now with the vaccine.""

8,The Battle Over The Last Piece Of Puerto Rico That Wasn’t For Sale,Hermes Ayala Guzmán,10/14/21,"RINCÓN, Puerto Rico ― To the west, a giant flaming peach of a sun sank into the horizon. Warm Caribbean waves lapped on the soft sandy shoreline where pregnant turtles drag themselves from the water each season to lay their eggs among mangroves and coconut palms. To the east, cloistered behind a garrison of plastic orange barricades, dozens of heavily armed police officers paced and revved motorcycle engines, standing guard over gray concrete and construction materials. Between the two, on a stretch of Los Almendros beach this August evening, is a small village of tents flying the black Puerto Rican flag of resistance.“This is a war zone,” Miriam Juan Rivera said, shooting a steely glare at the police. What began this spring as a local protest over the construction of a private pool on a public beach where endangered reptiles nest had, by the end of summer, evolved into a symbolic battle over the future of this island’s treasured waterfronts.For years, virtually everything in Puerto Rico, from the nature preserves to the power utility, had been for sale as the deeply indebted U.S.-owned archipelago struggles to pay back billions of dollars to Wall Street. The beaches ― public access to which is guaranteed under Puerto Rican law ― had long been the exception. But as the local government seeks to remake the island into a hub for mainlanders seeking to avoid taxes, it is finding new and creative ways to claim the waterfront.It’s happening all over the territory. On Vieques, the tiny island off Puerto Rico’s main island, locals who once took on the U.S. Navy and won are now struggling in “a vicious fight for access to the island,” according to a 2019 GlobalPost article, as Airbnb hosts build guesthouses on the beach. On the south coast, in Santa Isabel, the daughter of a former top government official is trying to build a hotel that would block access to a beach beloved by local kite surfers. In Dorado, just 30 minutes west of the capital city of San Juan, YouTube buffoon Logan Paul bought a beachside mansion earlier this year, bragged about flouting income taxes and proceeded to illegally drive a four-wheeler around in sand where turtles nest, declaring it his own.But Rincón offered one of the starkest examples of how the government and wealthy interests have aligned to crush Puerto Ricans’ attempts to preserve ecologically and culturally vital beaches.In late 2019, the board of directors at the luxury Condominios Sol Y Playa started laying plans to not only rebuild a pool destroyed during Hurricane María but expand it several feet onto the neighboring public beach. Sure enough, as environmentalists ― many of them retirees who live in this breezy seaside city ― started gathering at the beach to oppose the project, an army of police arrived in droves from departments as far as four hours away. Police boats patrolled waters where no one was swimming but the toddlers whose parents had come to protest. During one altercation in July, police in riot gear dragged an unarmed woman out by her hair.  Standing at the protest camp that formed on the beach, Ruperto Chaparro, director of the University of Puerto Rico’s Sea Grant program, said crushing the demonstrations would send a signal to wealthy Americans considering relocating to Puerto Rico that buying waterfront property here can, in fact, include a piece of Caribbean coastline devoid of actual Puerto Ricans.  “My theory is that this is a marketing tool to tell them this can be a private beach,” said Chaparro, whose federally funded group specializes in balancing the ecological and economic needs of coastal areas. “This is ridiculous.” ‘This Is Not About A Pool’The pool itself wasn’t the point. Putting aside reasonable queries as to why anyone needs a pool just feet from a shallow and quiet stretch of bathtub-warm Caribbean water, the Sol Y Playa condos had long had their own chlorinated swimming hole closer to the actual four-story complex. When Hurricane María lashed the coast with fierce winds and surging seas in 2017, the pool was destroyed. Instead of using the insurance money to rebuild what was previously there, the developers decided to go bigger, building out several feet into the beach itself. The developers at Sol Y Playa did not respond to emailed questions. It didn’t take long for word to get out once construction fences went up and backhoes started digging. There were obvious questions. If the last pool couldn’t withstand María, why would an even bigger pool, closer to the water, survive? Given that scientists say hurricanes are only growing more frequent and destructive as the planet warms, was it even wise to build anything new in the areas nature was so wrathfully reclaiming? The leatherback and hawksbill turtles who nested here were already endangered, shouldn’t their survival trump a new pool? How did this project even get permitted?Ángel Román, the environmental consultant the Sol Y Playa condos hired to assess the project, insisted that the construction met every permitting requirement and could withstand future hurricanes. “We have been extremely responsible in having an environmentally sound project,” he told the local news site NotiCel. Some condo owners at Sol Y Playa disagreed. Concerned over what he believed to be illegal construction, José Barea, 61, a lawyer who owns a unit in the complex, alerted local authorities. “You’ve got to respect that boundary that belongs to the people of Puerto Rico, we have to respect our fellow Puerto Ricans,” Barea said. “We cannot take what doesn’t belong to us.”  On May 17, Eliezer Molina, a former gubernatorial candidate and activist with tens of thousands of followers on social media, showed up on Los Almendros beach and broadcast an eight-minute live video in which he showed the construction site and complained that something so blatantly out of step with the area’s ecological constraints could only be approved through corrupt dealings. The video went viral, racking up more than 281,000 views and 10,000 shares on Facebook as of October.Three days later, the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, known by its Spanish acronym DRNA, sent the developers a cease-and-desist letter, forcing the project to halt construction. But just hours later, DRNA chief Rafael Machargo claimed the first order was not clear and reversed course, allowing construction to continue. At the start of July, the ecological toll of the project came into full view when a hawksbill turtle slid under the chain-link fence and laid 180 eggs. The turtle, listed by federal scientists as “endangered” and by the World Wildlife Foundation as “critically endangered,” remained trapped in the construction site until 7 a.m. the following morning, when a guard noticed her. Molina’s accusations quickly gained steam with a corruption-weary public. Two years earlier, up to 1 million Puerto Ricans had protested for weeks after leaked text messages showed close associates of then-Gov. Ricardo Rosselló directing major public contracts to friends and allies and speaking boorishly about those killed in Hurricane María. With as much as one-third of the territory’s population protesting in the streets of the capital, Rosselló had resigned in disgrace. The situation in Rincón didn’t have quite the same stakes, nor were there leaked internal communications directly linking current Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, Rosselló’s handpicked successor, to the swimming pool. But the circumstantial evidence was troubling, at least.‘Certainly A Crime’As the protests at Los Almendros grew, droves of police arrived, including officers from as far away as Ponce and Bayamón. In total, at least 534 officers stood guard at the construction site, collecting some $630,803 in overtime pay, according to the newspaper El Vocero. That figure doesn’t include what was spent to transport, feed and barricade the police in a makeshift headquarters alongside the condo complex.  On an archipelago where, unless you live in a wealthy community, dialing 911 is no guarantee that the police will even arrive, protesters saw the presence of so many armored and armed police as a sign a simple pool had become a political priority of the elite. Adding to that sense was the revelation that Walter Pierluisi Isern, the governor’s first cousin and former campaign political director, owned an apartment at Sol Y Playa. “This is not about a pool, this is about higher decision-making,” said Gloria Cuevas, a retired art teacher who had spent every day protesting. “After María, the island was open, and everyone saw poverty and need, and that, for some people, was an opportunity.”  The governor, for his part, defended the police deployment, telling El Vocero that the government has to “allow protest when it happens, but whenever the right to life and property is violated, the police have to be there.” But it was the protesters whose rights were most in jeopardy, according to the Puerto Rico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. By August, there were so many officers gathered by the entrance to Los Almendros beach, a visiting reporter at first mistook the condos for a police headquarters. The officers, many masked and holding guns openly, eyed anyone who walked the roughly 10-foot-wide pathway from the road to the sand and stationed at least one officer at a time at the entrance, as if checking tickets. When not at the beach, police cruised the otherwise peaceful streets of Rincón in groups, sometimes with two squad cars or a trio of motorcycles halting busy traffic to make way for themselves. “There was a young woman who was sitting in the public part of the beach and since she did not stop because she had the right to be there, they took her by the hair and dragged her,” said William Ramírez, the ACLU of Puerto Rico’s executive director. “That is certainly a crime.”A Turning Point? On Aug. 4, the governor’s planning board, a separate agency from the DRNA, voted unanimously to declare the pool illegal, yanking its permits. On Los Almendros, the news literally reverberated. The protesters danced and cheered, and those with instruments began playing music. At least a dozen people dove into the water to swim as a small burst of rain clouds dissipated and the sun emerged. In San Juan, critics of the government started looking for who was responsible. The ACLU filed a complaint with the federal government requesting an investigation into police brutality against protesters. Last month, the Puerto Rican House of Representatives issued a report accusing Machargo, the DNRA chief, of intimidating witnesses and refusing to turn over public documents related to the Rincón pool project. The island’s Senate then voted overwhelmingly to order Machargo to answer questions before a hearing. Advocates, meanwhile, demanded Pierluisi fire Machargo. Machargo said the investigation into him had “neither head nor tail” and accused the legislature of “interfering” with the conduct of his executive branch agency, something he said would “create a disastrous precedent.” “We did everything possible to safeguard the process,” Machargo said. A spokesperson for DNRA did not respond to a request for comment. The governor’s office did not return two calls requesting comment.Judith Enck, the former regional Environmental Protection Agency administrator for Puerto Rico under the Obama administration, said federal regulators have little power over land-use decisions in the territory, meaning the buck tends to stop with the sitting governor. “Puerto Rico should have learned the lesson of the need for climate change resiliency, and a central part of that is not constructing things along shorelines,” she said. “The Puerto Rican government should know better.”  During the Trump administration, when the White House repeatedly dismissed the concerns of Puerto Ricans and halted money Congress authorized to rebuild the territory, federal agencies had little leeway. “But that money is flowing now,” Enck said. “So there’s a need for stronger federal oversight.” Attention from Capitol Hill has helped elsewhere. At a hearing on federal climate funding for U.S. territories last February, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) pressed Machargo about the plans to build a hotel in another Puerto Rican municipality, Santa Isabel, that would cut off the community’s access to the beach. Machargo seemed flustered.“According to the law of the government of Puerto Rico, everybody should have access to the beach. That would be illegal to cut people from access to the beach,” Machargo told the congressman. “I will take note of that case and I will look into it to see if they have all the permits.” Eierí Ossorio, 40, an avid kitesurfer who grew up near the proposed hotel in Santa Isabel, credited local organizing for upending the proposed development in his town. But he said the federal scrutiny helped. “It’s been almost a year,” he said. “And they haven’t built a hotel anywhere.” In Rincón, the construction equipment has idled and most of the police have left. But the partially dug pool remains as the condo board fights in court to have the permits reinstated. Some protesters have remained on the beach, keeping watch. Barea, who began receiving routine threats to his family after he publicly opposed the project, said he has not returned to his unit at Sol Y Playa since June. The coastline is already dotted with new buildings. But some hope the issue could mark a turning point in the fight to keep Puerto Rico’s beaches open. “This is where people can go for fun for free, so, by doing this, they are increasing our vulnerability and reducing our resiliency when we have climate change,” Chaparro, the Sea Grant director, said. “We should be taking climate change seriously in our development plans.”Yet, in Puerto Rico, disregard for ecological boundaries is the longstanding norm. Back in 1997, DNRA surveyors had determined that the protections for Los Almendros beach weren’t sufficient, according to a recently resurfaced report. Despite that finding, construction crews broke ground the next year on a luxury development. Its name? Sol Y Playa. ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
19,A 112-year-old in Puerto Rico sets Guinness World Record as oldest living man,David Williams,7/4/21," A former sugar cane farmer in Puerto Rico has been confirmed as the world's oldest man by Guinness World Records, just a few weeks shy of his 113th birthday. Emilio Flores Márquez was born on August 8, 1908, in Carolina, Puerto Rico, making him 112 years and 326 days old as of Wednesday,  when Guinness World Records announced the record . Growing up, Márquez, who was the second oldest of 11 children, was in charge of many household chores and helped take care of his younger siblings.  As the first-born son, Márquez also helped on his father's sugar cane farm -- starting when he was a young boy -- and would water the plants and load cut sugar cane into wagons for transport, according to a news release from Guinness World Records. ""I was the oldest of the children, so I did everything,"" Márquez told Guinness World Records. ""I scrubbed, I took care of the boys, I did everything."" He continued farm, ""eventually becoming the way he supported his family,"" according to Guinness World Records. Márquez was married to Andrea Perez for 75 years until her death in 2010. The couple had four children. He also has five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, according to Guinness World Records. He now lives in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, with his two surviving children, Tirsa and ""Millito."" Márquez, who has lost most of his hearing, had surgery to implant a pacemaker when he was 101 years old -- but he is still strong and in good health, the news release said. Known as ""Don Millo,"" Márquez's key to a happy life is ""to have an abundance of love and to live life without anger,"" the news release said. ""My father raised me with love, loving everyone,"" Márquez's family told Guinness World Records. ""He always told me and my siblings to do good, to share everything with others."" The previous oldest living man recognized by Guinness World Records was Romania's Dumitru Comănescu. He died on June 27, 2020, less than a month after receiving the record, at the age of 111 years 219 days. Following his passing, Guinness World Records said it ""received evidence"" in support of Márquez, who was born three months earlier than Comănescu. The oldest living person on Earth is 118-year-old Kane Takana, who lives in a nursing home in Fukuoka, Japan. In March, her  grandson told CNN that Takana  is gunning for the record for the oldest person who's ever lived, which is  held by Jeanne Louise Calment,  a French woman who died at 122.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/04/us/guinness-world-records-oldest-man-wellness-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjck4ew4Mj6AhUKSDABHQKHB6g4jAEQFnoECAEQAg&usg=AOvVaw2xZ5RdFn9G-u-q3M9HBkbx,CNN,Liberal
20,"An electrical substation fire in Puerto Rico has knocked out power to 400,000 throughout the island","Jamiel Lynch, Luis Jaime Rodríguez and Andy Rose",6/10/21," A fire at an electrical substation in Puerto Rico has knocked out power to hundreds of thousands throughout the island, utility company LUMA Energy said Thursday. ""The fire caused major blackouts across the entire island. The situation is under assessment and work is being done to restore the system,"" LUMA Energy tweeted, stating that  restoration efforts  will continue overnight. About 400,000 customers in Puerto Rico were without power as of late Thursday, LUMA Energy said, which is more than  1 in 10 residents  on the island. The fire broke out in a transformer at LUMA's Monacillos substation, the company said. Personnel from the Puerto Rico Police, Fire Department and Medical Emergencies are at the scene and no injuries have been reported.  Calling it an explosion, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said that both state and federal law enforcement authorities are investigating the cause. ""All the resources of the PR government are available to handle the emergency caused by the fire at the Monacillos substation in Río Piedras. Firefighters have already arrived on the scene to handle to the situation. As soon as [firefighters] confirm more details, we will let you know,"" Pierluisi said on Twitter. ""The priority must be to re-establish the electrical service as soon as possible and our people can rest assured that we are making sure that this is the case. At the same time, as soon as we have the results of the investigations related to the cause of this incident, whoever is responsible for it will have to answer to the People of Puerto Rico,"" he said.  In a press conference with local media Thursday, LUMA Energy CEO Wayne Stensby said at the peak of the outage, 800,000 customers had been without power, according to  the newspaper  El Nuevo Día.  ""The FBI is evaluating the situation concerning the massive black out,"" FBI San Juan public affairs officer Limary Cruz-Rubio told CNN Thursday night, but would not comment further on the matter. Website hit by cyberattack earlier that day LUMA Energy said it was the victim of an earlier Distributed Denial of Service attack, in which a site is deliberately hit by massive amounts of web traffic in an attempt to overwhelm it. ""The DDoS attack was identified and has been issuing 2 million visits per second,"" LUMA Energy said in a statement. ""As a result, many clients may have had difficulty accessing the information related to their accounts."" There was no immediate indication of any connection between the website attack and the substation explosion.  ""The attack has been reported to the relevant authorities and LUMA awaits the results of an ongoing investigation,"" according to the press release. LUMA is a joint venture of Quanta Services and the Canadian energy company ATCO, which was chosen by the Puerto Rican government to take over the operation of the power grid from its previous public electric utility, PREPA.

21,Puerto Rico declares a state of emergency due to gender-based violence,Harmeet Kaur and Claudia Dominguez,1/25/21," Puerto Rico is declaring a state of emergency over gender-based violence, delivering on a demand made by activists in recent years after a wave of killings  targeting women  and  transgender people . Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who was sworn in earlier this month, announced an executive order aimed at preventing and protecting against gender-based violence through a number of programs, according  to a news release  from the governor's office on Sunday. The state of emergency will be in effect until June 30, 2022, the news release said. ""Gender violence is a social evil, based on ignorance and attitudes that cannot have space or tolerance in the Puerto Rico that we aspire to,"" Pierluisi said in a statement. ""For too long vulnerable victims have suffered the consequences of systematic machismo, inequity, discrimination, lack of education, lack of guidance and above all lack of action."" The order is the culmination of years of efforts by activists and advocacy organizations, who have long  urged  Puerto Rico's government to take action against gender-based violence -- which appears to have worsened after crises such as  Hurricane Maria  and the  coronavirus pandemic . At least 60 direct and indirect femicides were reported in Puerto Rico in 2020, according to the local group  Gender Equality Observatory . That includes six trans femicides and 26 cases still under investigation or lacking information, the organization said.  Puerto Rico's police  also reported that  at least 5,517 women were victims of domestic violence last year. Order's initiatives include a mobile app for victims Among the initiatives laid out in Pierluisi's executive order is a committee tasked with providing education, support and rescue around gender violence. That committee will be comprised of 17 members, three of whom will be representatives from organizations that work on gender violence issues. Committee members will present an initial progress report 45 days after their first meeting and every 30 days after that until the order expires. The governor also ordered the development of a mobile app through which victims of gender violence can request emergency help without arousing suspicion from their aggressors.  A compliance officer will also be appointed to oversee and ensure the order's implementation. ""In order to eradicate gender-based violence, we have to make concerted efforts between the state and society where in addition to an inclusive plan, an educational approach also exists to teach our boys and girls that every human being must be respected, as well as empowering our future generations so we can eradicate this evil,"" Pierluisi said. A longstanding problem on the island The governor's executive order comes just days after Angie Noemi González, a nurse and mother of three from the town of Barranquitas, was found dead in a ravine, the newspaper  El Nuevo Herald  reported. Police said that her longtime partner admitted to killing her, the newspaper  El Nuevo Día  reported. Puerto Rico has long been facing a crisis regarding violence against women. A  2012 report  from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that Puerto Rico had the highest per capita rate in the world of women over 14 killed by their partners. In several cases, women had repeatedly gone to authorities for help and were turned away, the organization reported. Researchers also found that law enforcement agencies largely failed to adequately respond to, record or investigate crimes of rape and sexual assault. And just a fraction of reported cases resulted in conviction,  the report stated . Pierluisi had  promised  during his campaign that he would take steps to address the problem. Activists  and  advocacy groups  welcomed the governor's order as a step in the right direction, though they said they would be watching to see how it was carried out. ""Today our rage carries some hope,"" the organization Colectiva Feminista en Construcción, which has been one of the leading groups pressuring the government to declare a state of emergency,  wrote on Facebook . ""Today, as always, our hope is radical. We will not take a step back.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/us/puerto-rico-emergency-gender-violence-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjck4ew4Mj6AhUKSDABHQKHB6g4jAEQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw1Scf26d31ZKs-LQtA693Gk,CNN,Liberal
9,Huge Arecibo Observatory Radio Telescope In Puerto Rico Collapses,Dánica Coto,12/1/20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A huge, already damaged radio telescope in Puerto Rico that has played a key role in astronomical discoveries for more than half a century completely collapsed on Tuesday.The telescope’s 900-ton receiver platform fell onto the reflector dish more than 400 feet below.The U.S. National Science Foundation had earlier announced that the Arecibo Observatory would be closed. An auxiliary cable snapped in August, causing a 100-foot gash on the 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) reflector dish and damaged the receiver platform that hung above it. Then a main cable broke in early November.The collapse stunned many scientists who had relied on what was until recently the largest radio telescope in the world.“It’s a huge loss,” said Carmen Pantoja, an astronomer and professor at the University of Puerto Rico who used the telescope for her doctorate. “It was a chapter of my life.”Scientists worldwide had been petitioning U.S. officials and others to reverse the NSF’s decision to close the observatory. The NSF said at the time that it intended to eventually reopen the visitor center and restore operations at the observatory’s remaining assets, including its two LIDAR facilities used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research, including analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data.The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. It had endured hurricanes, tropical humidity and a recent string of earthquakes in its 57 years of operation.The telescope has been used to track asteroids on a path to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable. It also served as a training ground for graduate students and drew about 90,000 visitors a year.“I am one of those students who visited it when young and got inspired,” said Abel Méndez, a physics and astrobiology professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo who has used the telescope for research. “The world without the observatory loses, but Puerto Rico loses even more.”He last used the telescope on Aug. 6, just days before a socket holding the auxiliary cable that snapped failed in what experts believe could be a manufacturing error. The National Science Foundation, which owns the observatory that is managed by the University of Central Florida, said crews who evaluated the structure after the first incident determined that the remaining cables could handle the additional weight.But on Nov. 6, another cable broke.A spokesman for the observatory said there would be no immediate comment, and a spokeswoman for the University of Central Florida did not return requests for comment.Scientists had used the telescope to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed. About 250 scientists worldwide had been using the observatory when it closed in August, including Méndez, who was studying stars to detect habitable plantes.“I’m trying to recover,” he said. “I am still very much affected.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
22,A 122-year love-hate relationship: Puerto Rico -- once again -- will vote on statehood,Ray Sanchez and Veronica Stracqualursi,10/31/20," Michelle Rodriguez Olivero's social media feed hasn't been buzzing about Tuesday's nonbinding vote to make Puerto Rico the 51st star on the American flag. Nor has there been much   dinner table talk about it among her many pro-commonwealth relatives in the northern coastal town of Dorado. After all, the island's been here before. And nothing has changed, since the referendums are nonbinding. ""We've had five votes   with no political consequence,"" said Rodriguez, 31, a poet who works for a nonprofit and supports independence for Puerto Rico. ""It has not led to more funding for the island. We still cannot vote for the President. People have no respect for this process.""  For the third time this decade,  Puerto Ricans will vote on statehood , which is ultimately in the hands of the US Congress .   This time, however, voters on the island will simply be asked, ""Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?"" Yes/No.  But the island's history is far from simple. As a US territory, Puerto Ricans are natural-born US citizens and can vote in presidential primary elections, but not in the general election, unless they live on the mainland. They don't have a vote in Congress. ""You know how I see the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States?"" said Luis Martinez-Fernandez, a history professor at the University of Central Florida. ""It's a couple and they've been dating for over a century. But they're not married and neither side is convinced strongly enough they want that marriage. Because if at least one side wanted it, and the other not, well that side could try to seduce the other side. But in the case of Puerto Rico, there is no consensus."" The island has voted in favor of statehood twice before It's a love-hate relationship dating to the Spanish-American War of 1898, when  the US invaded and acquired the small Caribbean island.  It's been a US territory since 1952. The issue of statehood has always been a point of contention. Of the five nonbinding referendums since 1967, the 2012 vote was the first in favor of statehood. Political analysts at the time said the  outcome likely reflected an overwhelming desire for a status change in general,  whether it be statehood, independence or some other solution. No action was taken in Washington.  In 2017, Puerto Ricans voted overwhelmingly for statehood in yet another nonbinding referendum. But  only 23% of eligible citizens voted  after opposition parties urged a boycott of an election they said was ""rigged"" in the way the ballot was worded.   Again, no action was taken. On Tuesday, residents will again consider statehood the same day pro-statehood gubernatorial candidate Pedro Pierluisi faces Carlos Delgado Altieri, candidate of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, in a tight race.  But analysts said Pierluisi's governing New Progressive Party -- beset by corruption scandals and criticized for bungling the aftermath of Hurricane Maria after plunging the island into economic collapse -- organized the statehood vote to animate its base at a crucial moment.  ""The catastrophe left behind by Hurricanes Irma and Maria unmasked the reality of the unequal treatment of the American living in Puerto Rico,"" resident commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón, a Republican and the island's sole, nonvoting member of Congress,  said when she launched the new statehood effort in 2018.  The statehood ballot measure, González-Colón promised, would finally put the island  ""on the path towards the political equality we deserve.""  Support for statehood among Democrats That road to the great state of Puerto Rico is pitted and complicated.  The referendum would need Congress' approval to establish Puerto Rico as the newest state — and that all depends on how the November elections shake out. Congressional Democrats have led the push for Puerto Rico and  Washington, DC , to be admitted as states, but Republican leadership opposes the idea, arguing it could give Democrats four seats in the US Senate and allow them to push what the GOP calls a socialist agenda. So while a statehood measure might fare better in the Democratic-controlled US House, legislation for Puerto Rico statehood is unlikely to advance in the Republican-led US Senate, and President Donald Trump has said he would be an ""absolute no"" on statehood for the island.  Puerto Rico has a likelier chance of becoming a state if Democrats win control of the Senate in November, keep the US House and Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House — giving Democrats complete control of the federal government.  ""I happen to believe statehood would be the most effective means of ensuring that residents of Puerto Rico are treated equally, with equal representation at the federal level, but the people of Puerto Rico must decide, and the United States federal government must respect and act on that decision,"" Biden said in September while campaigning in Kissimmee, Florida. The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, who could be the next majority leader if Democrats win the Senate, has voiced support for Puerto Rican statehood and suggested his party would consider the island's status if it takes back the upper chamber. Bills address pathway for Puerto Rico Still, even if Democrats retake the Senate, it won't be an easy ride to statehood.  A Democratic majority in the chamber is likely to be slim, which could mean that Senate Republicans opposed to statehood would be able to block any measure with a filibuster. Some Democrats, however, are already suggesting the filibuster be eliminated if Republicans stonewall their every move.  And while Democrats in the House passed a bill in June to admit DC as a state, they seem split on Puerto Rico.  Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, a Democrat, and González-Colón have  introduced a bipartisan bill  establishing a process to admit Puerto Rico as a state. The bill garnered support from a handful of House Republicans, including Rep. Don Young of Alaska, a longtime advocate of Puerto Rico statehood, and other GOP lawmakers from Florida and New York. Soto said in an interview that the ""votes are there"" and most House Democrats support statehood, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Democratic Reps. Nydia Velazquez and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed a bill in August calling for a status convention where delegates, elected by Puerto Ricans, develop an option for the island's status with the intent that it be voted on. The bill by the New York congresswomen -- which has no Republican co-sponsors -- hints at the Democratic divide on the statehood issue. ""If the people of Puerto Rico vote yes, that bill's unnecessary,"" Soto told CNN. ""We don't need a constitutional convention to slow down the will of the people should they vote that way. If the people vote no, that may be another option, certainly. But it starts with the election."" He added, ""If the people vote yes, they'll be hard pressed to find a lot of support among House Democrats to ignore an election and stand in the way of a majority-Hispanic island becoming the next state of the United States."" 'We would be like New Jersey, my dear' But many Puerto Ricans as well as political observers on the island and the mainland are wary of the statehood effort.  Pedro Cabán, a professor of Latin American, Caribbean and US Latino studies at the University at Albany-SUNY, dismissed the referendum as political ""pageantry.""  About  3.1 million people live on the island,  and more than 5.6 million Puerto Ricans live on the mainland, according to 2017 data from the Pew Research Center.  ""I get the sense that when Puerto Ricans leave the island, they're even more nationalistic than when they're on the island,"" Cabán said. ""If they're more nationalistic, that means it's harder for me to believe they really are into statehood."" Some Puerto Ricans fear the cultural implications of statehood, particularly losing a sense of national identity and Spanish as the official language.  ""We love to participate in the Miss Universe pageant and the World Baseball Classic,"" said Cynthia García Coll, a psychologist who teaches at the University of Puerto Rico. ""That unites us like nothing else. All that would be gone under statehood. We would be like New Jersey, my dear."" Many island residents doubt the United States -- long indifferent to their plight -- would accept a 51st state that is Spanish-speaking and poorer than the poorest US state, Mississippi. ""The United States opposition to Puerto Rican statehood has been based upon a racist concept, actually beginning with the idea of giving statehood to Spanish-speaking, brown skin Catholic foreigners,"" Cabán said. ""The fundamental opposition is based upon this notion of Puerto Ricans being other than."" Martinez-Fernandez doubts the latest statehood push will succeed even if all the political stars align in its favor.  ""The atmosphere in Washington is not propitious for that at all,"" he said. ""You know, in this country we can't come to an agreement about whether to wear masks or not. Imagine inviting a new state that is going to push the balance of power further into the Democratic side. There's no chance that the Republicans will stand for that."" Statehood is unlikely even if Democrats take the White House and Senate, he said.  ""It would be way down in the stack of papers on Biden's desk,"" Martinez-Fernandez said. ""He has to reconstruct this country."" 'Love always triumphs over status politics' Rodriguez, the poet in Dorado, said most of her relatives -- concerned about preserving their national identity -- are pro commonwealth, or the status quo on the island. She said she supports independence because it would allow the island to finally break the chains of US colonial control. They all plan to vote no on statehood.  Other Puerto Ricans are throwing their support behind the burgeoning Citizens' Victory Movement, which is promoting a progressive, anti-colonial ideology -- a move that could help the governing, pro-statehood party. ""Many times the conversation is not about which candidates are the most qualified but about, if we let go of the United States, we will die of hunger,"" Rodriguez said.  Cabán recalled a married couple that was leading recovery efforts in a town in the countryside after Hurricane Maria devastated the island and left thousands dead in September 2017.   ""I remember him saying, 'I'm pro independence, dammit!' "" Cabán said. ""And I asked, 'What about your wife?' And he says, 'She's pro statehood.' Is that a problem? 'No,' he says, 'Statehood will never come.' And she says, 'And independence will never come.' Love always triumphs over status politics.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/31/politics/puerto-rico-2020-statehood-vote/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjdiK3A1cj6AhUYZDABHX3WAMs4FBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3eZbU-5-JWnAY9gnuOE8q_,CNN,Liberal
23,Trump administration announces $13 billion in additional aid to Puerto Rico,Jim Acosta and Betsy Klein,9/18/20," The Trump administration on Friday announced $13 billion in additional aid to Puerto Rico to help with rebuilding in the aftermath of 2017's Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced  tweeted  Friday morning that Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Pete Gaynor told her that $13 billion has been approved. She thanked the White House and  President Donald Trump . White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany touted the $13 billion FEMA award as two of the agency's ""largest grants ever"" in a statement. It will include a $11.6 billion federal share of funding for the projects. The move is likely an attempt to appeal to Puerto Rican voters who moved to the battleground state of Florida after the hurricane struck the US territory. In the three years since the storm made landfall, the rebuilding process has been slow and costly. In November 2018, White House officials told congressional leaders and appropriators that the  President did not want any additional relief funding  sent to the island. Asked why he didn't approve the aid package years ago, Trump baselessly claimed in a Friday news conference that it was the Democrats' fault. ""Very tough to get things passed, Democrats, where they don't want to see this happen,"" he said, though the reality is his administration held up aid to the island as he criticized its residents. The President also boasted that he is the ""best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico"" despite having criticized the island and its residents for years. Trump's lack of empathy for Puerto Ricans has been at odds with his treatment of storm victims in the continental US during his tenure in office, prompting criticism of racism, including from some local officials defending their home. Trump's handling of the 2017 storm, which devastated the island and killed nearly 3,000 people in its aftermath, has been widely criticized by locals and experts. Trump has consistently denied any fault for his administration, and has instead sought praise for his handling of Hurricane Maria, at one point calling it ""an incredible, unsung success."" Trump was  lambasted  for his visit to Puerto Rico weeks after the storm, where he was pictured tossing paper towels to a crowd of survivors. Since then, he's publicly slammed local officials, falsely railed against what he said was an overreported death toll, and questioned aid to the territory. Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, who was in the role as the hurricane hit, said in a July interview that Trump considered the idea of selling the island after the storm hit. Tensions between the President and the island  boiled over  in March 2019 when then-Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló fired back after the White House officials warned his top aides that representatives of the territory were pushing too hard to arrange a meeting with the President aimed at discussing the island's dire situation. ""If the bully gets close, I'll punch the bully in the mouth,"" Rosselló told CNN at the time. ""It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage."" And as Hurricane Dorian approached Puerto Rico in August 2019, Trump again  trained his ire  at its government. ""Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!"" he wrote, adding, ""And by the way, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico!"" The government's $13 billion investment will directly address electrical and educational systems, McEnany's statement said. ""Federal funding of $9.6 billion will allow the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority to repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines, electrical substations, power generation systems, office buildings and make other grid improvements. The $2 billion grant for the Puerto Rico Department of Education will focus on restoring school buildings and educational facilities across the island,"" McEnany said. The grants, she added, ""exceed the total Public Assistance funding in any single federally declared disaster other than Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy."" This story has been updated with remarks from Trump. CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-aid-puerto-rico/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj6pOen4cj6AhXYn4QIHYK2Cos4lgEQFnoECAEQAg&usg=AOvVaw2JLfHLjorQgaOWrKBTosK3,CNN,Liberal
24,Puerto Rico's future is for Puerto Ricans to determine,Nancy Santiago and Frankie Martínez-Blanco,8/21/20," Every year that passes without the federal government affording Puerto Ricans the opportunity to express their will is another reminder of the shameful history of the United States' colonialism. It was 244 years ago when the 13 colonies made it clear that their relationship with the British crown was not working. Today, another colonial relationship --between Puerto Rico and the US-- is not working and is in desperate need of reassessment.    From the  negligent federal response  to Hurricane Maria,  which killed about 3,000 people , to the  imposition of an unelected and undemocratic fiscal control board  and the  capricious slashing of federal funds  covering  health care ,  housing ,  education  and other services, Puerto Ricans have been demanding a reevaluation of the current relationship. Such reassessment should honor the democratic voices of those on the island and close the chapter on its 122-year-old colonial history with the US.      Addressing the historical dysfunction in this relationship, which enables the federal government to treat over 3 million people residing on the island as second-class US citizens, begins with providing Puerto Ricans the opportunity to be heard through a fair, transparent and legally-binding self-determination process that reflects the diversity of options different Puerto Ricans support around the island's future political status.   The dysfunctional relationship started in 1898 when  an island full of people with a distinct culture and identity was handed from one ""owner"" (Spain) to another . This was akin to a real estate transaction at the end of the Spanish-American War --with no regard to the well-being and the interests of its people. Since then, a series of US court decisions along with arbitrary and unfair policies have hampered Puerto Rico's growth. This includes the 1920 Merchant Marine Act (or Jones Act), which for the last 100 years has imposed  shipping restrictions on the Island that increase the cost of goods coming in , while at the same time, protects a corporate shipping monopoly. To read that  President Donald Trump considered selling Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria  obliterated the island in 2017 is a reflection of the reality that this US territory, to this day, has been denied one of the most basic human rights: self-determination.    There is an opportunity to turn the page. The ""great awakening"" we are in the midst of —prompted by unchecked police brutality,  voter suppression  and the unmasking of systemic racism— is the moment to reevaluate our current democratic and social contract with fresh perspectives and new voices.    To eradicate the systemic racism at the root of this colonial problem —and for our people to determine our own destiny— leaders in Washington have to commit to providing Puerto Ricans a self-determination process that includes  all the status options  widely recognized in Puerto Rico and Washington:   independence ,  statehood , a  modified commonwealth  or  free association .    Puerto Rico has held  five non-binding votes , meaning that Congress has not committed to honoring any of the results. Another plebiscite slated for November is already controversial because it's rigged to only benefit the statehood option and, last month, the  US Department of Justice announced it will not disburse funds towards this process .   While the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, has promised a real  self-determination process  that includes  all options  and to work on a bill with Congress that actually solves the problem, the roadmap to a decolonizing process still needs to be outlined. In the meantime, Trump and the GOP have yet to offer an official position on self-determination although  the President has been clear in expressing  that  Puerto Rico is a nuisance to him .      Puerto Ricans deserve the freedom to choose the political status they want. A fair, inclusive and transparent process to make that determination has to be supported not only by the next president but also by Congress. Lawmakers must agree to a congressionally-binding process that honors a decolonization procedure that clearly delineates how the US would support Puerto Rico's transition to another status.     A self-determination process must be carried out not under the threat of impoverishment, but with the confidence of success, meaning a path to a strong economy, no matter the political status Puerto Ricans choose. This has to start with canceling the island's unsustainable $73 billion debt and providing it economic tools to thrive.    Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new  newsletter. Join us on  Twitter  and  Facebook Those who are personally affected must drive the conversation. This begins with supporting diverse Puerto Rican voices in educating people stateside about how the dysfunctional relationship between Puerto Rico and the US has, for example,  held back economic development on the island , triggering a massive migration of young professionals to the mainland and enabled a local public education system with  rampant   corruption  and where eighth-graders fall to the very  bottom of math proficiency .   Too often, Puerto Rico's issues are covered and discussed without any deep context about the colonial relationship. Allies can help by joining Puerto Ricans in demanding that our voices are heard and in calling their representatives and senators to support an inclusive self-determination process. Anything short of that is, at best, just lip-service and, at worst, another reaffirmation of the second-class citizenship of Puerto Ricans disguised as ""progressive"" solidarity.

25,Puerto Rico voting temporarily halted amid lack of ballots,"Melissa Alonso, Ana Cucalón and Marlon Sorto",8/9/20," Puerto Rico's primary elections were temporarily halted Sunday because of a lack of ballots in voting centers across the island, according to election officials.  The State Elections Commission (CEE) suspended voting at some precincts because they had not received ballots, CEE said. The CEE later announced voting would be rescheduled for any precincts that were not able to open by 1:45 p.m. Sunday. Voting will resume at those centers on August 16 from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m., according to a CEE release. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced blasted the CEE in a  tweet .

26,Montana entrepreneur who sparked controversy during Puerto Rico hurricane response wins $4M no-bid PPE contract,Casey Tolan,7/14/20," Almost three years after a tiny Montana company ignited a firestorm of controversy when it signed a massive contract to repair Puerto Rico's hurricane-battered electricity grid, the firm's CEO has won another disaster relief deal: supplying the federal government with protective gear in the fight against the coronavirus.  A new company co-led by Andy Techmanski, the CEO of Whitefish Energy, signed a no-bid, $4 million contract in late June to provide reusable isolation gowns for the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to  federal contracting records .  Whitefish won a $300 million contract to help rebuild Puerto Rico's electricity grid after the devastating Hurricane Maria in September 2017, even though it had limited experience in disaster relief and just a handful of employees when the storm hit the island. The deal was cancelled by the island's governor barely a month later amid allegations of price-gouging and questions surrounding how Whitefish got the job.  Years later, Puerto Rico officials have said there were no improprieties in how Whitefish's contract was awarded and no problems with the company's work -- although two federal agencies are still reviewing the deal and its costs. The company is still waiting for a more than $106 million payment from Puerto Rico's bankrupt electric utility, according to  records from the utility . Now Techmanski says he wants to put the controversy behind him and focus on his new venture. His new company, Merrow-FORLOH Medical, is a partnership between FORLOH, an outdoor apparel brand recently launched by Techmanski, and Merrow Manufacturing, a more than 180-year-old textile company in Massachusetts that  calls itself  the largest domestic manufacturer of PPE.  Merrow-FORLOH has produced more than 1.5 million gowns for hospitals and state governments, according to the company. Under the $4 million contract with the VA, the company will provide a total of 100,000 reusable gowns over the next four months, a VA spokesperson said. She said Techmanski had no interaction with the agency during the contracting process.  At a time when some hospitals are again facing PPE shortages amid a new spike in coronavirus cases and government agencies have  scrambled  to secure masks and gowns from abroad, Techmanski and Merrow say building up a domestic PPE manufacturing base should be a crucial priority for the U.S. Still, contracting experts say the fact that officials awarding the deal couldn't consider Whitefish's history shows a potential weakness in federal contracting. Federal rules say that agencies can only evaluate vendors by looking at past performance by that company, not the record of other companies run by the same people, according to Trevor Brown, a professor at Ohio State University and an expert in government contracting.  ""The contracting officer, the person actually doing the purchasing, is not allowed to go look at what the other company did,"" Brown said. ""If this is a new company, it has no past performance."" Controversial contract The new federal contract comes as legal battles and federal inquiries are still playing out over Whitefish's work in Puerto Rico.  When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, Techmanski suspected that Whitefish's experience using helicopters to rebuild power lines could be useful in Puerto Rico's mountainous terrain. He started reaching out to officials on the island through LinkedIn, he said. He ended up taking a flight to Puerto Rico just days later, reviewing toppled power lines with officials from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and signing a $300 million contract with the utility in a dimly lit conference room. PREPA officials said they chose Whitefish because it was the only bidder not to require a large downpayment from the cash-strapped utility, and because it was willing to handle the logistics of getting workers to the island.  But the company had never led any job at the scale of the Puerto Rico reconstruction, which drew attention on the mainland. Critics zeroed in on the fact that Techmanski lived in the same small Montana town as then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Zinke's son had previously worked a summer job for Whitefish. Techmanski and Zinke have repeatedly said the secretary had nothing to do with the company winning the contract, although Zinke said Whitefish reached out to him after it was signed to get assistance delivering resources to the island. Zinke left the Trump administration  in January 2019  after facing ethical issues.  Whitefish's contract charged PREPA up to $319 an hour for linemen working on the reconstruction project, which some observers said at the time was inflated. The  New York Times reported  that the company was paying some linemen only $63 an hour even as it charged the utility much more. Techmanski told CNN the company's rates were reasonable considering the risk and the logistical difficulties of working on the island, and that his prices were in ""the middle of the pack"" compared to other bidders.  Another provision of the  contract  specified that federal and local authorities would not be allowed ""to audit or review the cost and profit elements of the labor rates"" Whitefish was getting paid. FEMA administrator Brock Long  testified  before Congress that ""there's no lawyer inside FEMA that would have ever agreed to the language that was in that contract to begin with."" The contract was eventually  amended  to remove that provision.  As scrutiny over Whitefish grew and Congress and federal agencies moved to investigate, PREPA  cancelled  the contract in late October 2017 at the request of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who said it had become a ""distraction."" Whitefish continued working through November.  Techmanski argues that Whitefish performed well in perilous conditions over its two months on the job, pointing to PREPA  documents  that show it successfully restored power to five transmission line segments. ""We essentially got pulled down into the swamp and used as a political toy,"" he said.  Fernando Padilla, a PREPA project management officer, said in an email that there were no problems with the quality of Whitefish's work. In addition, Puerto Rico's comptroller reviewed Whitefish's contract and concluded in 2018 that there were no irregularities in how it was awarded, according to  local media reports . The comptroller's office did not respond to a request for comment.  The company that took over the work after Whitefish left -- Cobra Acquisitions -- ended up charging the government far more than Whitefish, according to PREPA budget documents. It also fell into legal trouble: Two Cobra executives and a FEMA official were  arrested  in 2019 and charged with federal bribery and fraud crimes. Whitefish was not accused of wrongdoing.  Still, the probes into Whitefish's work in Puerto Rico aren't over, even almost three years later. The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office told CNN this week that its audit into Whitefish's Puerto Rico contract is still ongoing. And a FEMA spokesperson said the agency ""continues to review documentation pertaining to the Whitefish Energy company,"" including assessing whether it complied with laws and regulations and ""ensuring that the work performed is eligible and costs are reasonable.""  In federal bankruptcy court, meanwhile, Whitefish has been fighting to get paid. PREPA, which is going through bankruptcy, has paid Whitefish $36.9 million and still owes the company an additional $106.4 million, according to the utility's most recent  cash flow report , from April 2020. In court filings, Whitefish has claimed it is also owed millions more due to the delays in getting paid, based on its contract. Some local observers say that the controversy over Whitefish looks less problematic in retrospect, especially compared with the companies that came after them.  Whitefish ""should never have been hired in the first place, but we have no evidence of there being any impropriety with them,"" said John Mudd, a lawyer in Puerto Rico who's followed the legal saga over the hurricane recovery but isn't representing any of the companies involved. ""They did their job."" From power lines to PPE In the years after pulling out of Puerto Rico, Whitefish received several other smaller jobs from the federal government performing electrical work. But Techmanski said the controversy over the Maria response -- and the $100 million hole in his budget -- became an inescapable drag on the company. An avid hunter, Techmanski said he decided to follow his ""dream"" of building an outdoor apparel company that manufactures its clothing in the U.S. The company,  FORLOH , which is based at the same Whitefish, Montana address as Whitefish Energy and employs several of the same executives, was scheduled to launch earlier this year. But when the coronavirus hit, Techmanski said he realized that the sophisticated waterproof fabric the company was developing for hunting jackets -- the same kind of material used in military parachutes -- could also be used to make PPE.  He partnered with Merrow Manufacturing, a Massachusetts-based textile company that's also  turned its production line  to masks and gowns. Charlie Merrow, the company's CEO, said the two companies had originally been discussing the development of technical fabrics for hunting gear. ""It was perfect timing for both companies to be able to act,"" Merrow said. ""Unless the two companies had been in the same room together at that moment, this would not have happened."" Merrow said he hadn't known about Whitefish's history when the two companies joined forces, but that wouldn't have stopped him from working with FORLOH.   So far, their company has manufactured more than 1.5 million level one and level two isolation gowns, sending them to hospitals and state governments, Techmanski said.  The VA contract for 100,000 gowns charges $40 per reusable gown. While that's higher than prices other federal agencies have paid for gowns from  other companie s, Merrow-FORLOH's gowns can be washed and reused 600 times,  according to the company , while many other reusable gowns can be used far less. Christina Noel, a VA spokesperson, said the price was attractive because some single-use disposable gowns are currently going for $4 to $5 each on the market.  The Merrow-FORLOH contract was awarded without a competitive bidding process because no-bid contracts ""can help provide the flexibility needed to ensure that we receive the required supplies in time to support clinical needs,"" Noel said. The gowns will be used at VA hospitals in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia, she said. After Hurricane Maria, Techmanski said he doubted he'd ever get involved in high-stakes disaster relief again. Now, he said he jokes to his friends that ""I'm the guy you probably want to be next to when a disaster hits.""  Returning to disaster relief efforts ""makes me a lightning rod,"" Techmanski said. ""But I can hold my head high and say we saved thousands of lives.""

27,"New York Times: Trump considered selling Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, former acting Homeland Security chief says",Devan Cole,7/12/20," President Donald Trump  considered the idea of selling Puerto Rico in 2017 after the island was devastated by  Hurricane Maria,  the former acting Homeland Security secretary told  The New York Times  in an interview published Friday.   ""The President's initial ideas were more of as a businessman, you know,"" Elaine Duke, who was serving as DHS' acting secretary when the hurricane hit the island in September 2017, told the Times.  ""'Can we outsource the electricity? Can we can we sell the island? You know, or divest of that asset?'"" Trump reportedly said, according to Duke in the newspaper interview. ""(She said the idea of selling Puerto Rico was never seriously considered or discussed after Mr. Trump raised it.),"" the paper reported.  Trump has had a fraught history with the US territory  since Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria. Nearly 3,000 people died as a result of the storm and aftereffects, including widespread power outages.  Trump has previously taken aim at Puerto Rican officials for their management of the billions in relief funds his administration has appropriated for storm recovery, accusing the island's leaders of spending some of that money for reasons other than hurricane clean-up. In November 2018, White House officials told congressional leaders and appropriators that  the President did not want any additional relief funding sent to the island. Trump has consistently denied any fault for his administration in the aftermath of the storm. The President has instead sought praise for his handling of Hurricane Maria, calling it ""an incredible, unsung success"" last year.

28,"5.5 magnitude earthquake rattles Puerto Rico, damages buildings in Ponce",Artemis Moshtaghian and Jay Croft,5/2/20," A 5.5-magnitude earthquake was recorded off the waters of southern Puerto Rico early Saturday, rattling the city of Ponce, according to the  US Geological Survey . Other earthquakes ranging from 3.4 to 4.9 on the Richter scale have hit the same area. No tsunami advisory has been issued. Ponce Mayor Maria ""Mayita"" Melendez said several buildings were damaged. Officials are assessing the quake's effects and checking on citizens, she said. The Electric Energy Authority tweeted that its EcoElectrica power plant was offline, but crews were working to restore service. It was not clear how many residents had lost power.   The Puerto Rican Water and Sewage Authority has inspected three dams on the island and found no damage, Gov. Wanda Vazquez Garced said in a tweet.   ""We emphasize the importance of remaining calm and urge everyone to always use a face covering when outside the home,"" Vazquez said in a tweet in Spanish.

10,Puerto Rico To Partially Reopen Despite Coronavirus Concerns,DANICA COTO,5/1/20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico is taking its first tentative steps in relaxing a nearly two-month lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic, while health experts warn that the U.S. territory is relying on faulty statistics and has not yet seen its peak of cases.Gov. Wanda Vázquez announced Thursday night that starting Monday, certain sectors including finance and real estate will reopen. On May 11, construction and manufacturing are allowed to restart. Other businesses also allowed to soon reopen on weekdays will include laundromats, moving services and those that repair elevators and air conditioning units. In mid to late May, the retail trade, barbershops and beauty salons will be allowed to operate. All businesses are ordered to provide protective equipment to their workers, and anyone entering a business has to wear a face mask.The lockdown for everyone else was extended until May 25, with some exceptions. People will be allowed outside to run, bike and walk their dogs from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Parks, gyms and beaches remain closed, and everyone except essential workers are ordered to stay inside from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.“We cannot forget that we’re facing a real emergency,” Vázquez said. “If there’s no need to leave your house, don’t.”Puerto Rico has reported at least 92 deaths and more than 1,500 confirmed cases. However, the government is no longer sharing key statistics, including how many people have been tested. As of last week, Puerto Rico had the lowest per capita testing rate compared with any U.S. state, with some 12,000 people tested on an island of 3.2 million.It’s an issue that worries Mónica Feliú-Mójer, spokeswoman for CienciaPR, a nonprofit group of Puerto Rican scientists who seek widespread testing.“We don’t know where we stand with the infections and the pandemic,” she said in a phone interview. “Every day, we have less access to data.”One of her biggest concerns is how the government would be able to determine if there is widespread contagion following the partial reopening of businesses. She noted that Vázquez’s televised address came on the same day that more than 100 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were announced, one of the highest numbers since the lockdown was implemented in mid-March.Others have concerns over the economic damage that the extended lockdown will have on an island still recovering from Hurricane Maria and a series of recent earthquakes amid a long recession.Economist José Caraballo said in a phone interview that the lockdown has had a $5 billion to $10 billion impact on the island’s economy. He also worries about a growing number of small businesses that have permanently closed.“There’s been no mention about implementing measures to counteract the negative impact of the lockdown’s extension,” he said.While Puerto Rico’s government has started distributing incentives to certain workers, tens of thousands are still awaiting unemployment benefits and food assistance. And islanders have yet to receive the $1,200 federal incentive.Among those cautiously cheering the governor’s announcement amid the financial squeeze was Jesús Vázquez, who is now authorized to open his laundromat.“You feel good that you’re finally getting some income,” he said. “We will take all security measures needed, but you’re still afraid regardless.”A HuffPost Guide To CoronavirusStay up to date with our live blog as we cover the COVID-19 pandemicWhat happens if we end social distancing too soon?What you need to know about face masks right nowWill there be a second stimulus check?Lost your job due to coronavirus?

29,"Weeks after a deadly earthquake, Puerto Rico is rattled again",Dave Hennen,2/4/20," A magnitude 5 earthquake on Tuesday struck Puerto Rico, where people are still on edge from a series of quakes after last month's deadly  6.4 temblor . It was the 11th earthquake of at least that size in the past 30 days, according to the  US Geological Survey .  The earthquake's center was 13 miles southeast of Guanica on the southwest coast, according to the US Geological Survey.  Shelters were already emptying shortly after the quake hit at 10:45 a.m., but it left several municipal employees ""requiring emotional assistance,"" Guayanilla Mayor Nelson Torres Yordan told newspaper El Nuevo Dia.  The magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7 left one person dead, destroyed dozens of homes and structures, and left 300,000 without water and two-thirds of the island without power.  Since late December, a  series of quakes  -- about 500 of magnitude 2 or greater -- have rattled Puerto Rico, hitting infrastructure already weakened from Category 5  Hurricane Maria  that struck the island in September 2017.  CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.

30,"For Puerto Rico's earthquake families, trauma continues thousands of miles from home",Ray Sanchez,1/29/20," The beefy ex-cop sleeps in a twin-size trundle bed a few inches off the hardwood floor. His wife, their 17-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son rest on the attached full-size bed, and their 16-year-old son turns in on the upper bunk. Another couple and their 10-year-old son share a queen-size bed in the next room. Three other families sleep on hulking inflatable mattresses that, when propped up during the day, block out the sunlight in the dining and living rooms.  This is life these days for more than a dozen of Jodie Roure's relatives who fled  a swarm of earthquakes that have hit Puerto Rico since late December . They cram her two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan's Hamilton Heights neighborhood, forcing Roure to split them up to manage their stress.   ""The tension buildup was so bad that I had some stay with another family member,"" said Roure, 49, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""You have 14 to 16 people in less than 1,000 square feet."" Since  the ground started shaking on December 28  -- leaving at least one person dead, causing dozens of buildings to crumble, and cutting power and water to swaths of the island -- terrified families have been fleeing Puerto Rico.   Stunned residents, fearing the worst, have abandoned homes for cars and vans, for mattresses dragged onto sidewalks and sprawling tent-covered encampments.        For Roure's relatives, the daily lines outside her lone bathroom aren't so bad in comparison. ""The other day I told my husband to get me a bucket because I couldn't wait,"" Mirta Santiago Cortés, 67, said with a laugh. There also are discussions about polarized island politics. Meal preparation and cleanup duties. And agreeing on what to eat each night.  ""We've had our arguments,"" said Santiago's daughter, Sharon Quiñones Cortés, 46, who came with her to New York with her own husband and their young son, Sebastian. It's not the life they'd chose. But, at least for now, it beats the seismic terror. And they're not alone.  Earthquakes prompt the latest diaspora  It's too early to quantify the scope of this latest diaspora. Even before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, an unprecedented migration had begun from the Caribbean island to the mainland United States. It was fueled in part by the US commonwealth's prolonged financial crisis. Then,  tens of thousands more departed  after  the deadly storm , moving to every US state, from Florida to Alaska.  Now, they're taking flight again -- running from packed shelters set up under tent clusters in hard-hit southern coastal towns assailed by  hundreds of temblors. Santiago, waiting for a pot of coffee to brew in the small kitchen in Hamilton Heights, came to the mainland this month with 16 relatives, all with one-way tickets on the same flight. She said her sister and husband -- whose home in Puerto Rico was destroyed -- also left in January to stay with family in Chicago.  Another relative, Miguel Rodriguez, said eight more family members from the island -- including his mother, his daughter and grandchildren -- moved from Puerto Rico to his Orlando home two weeks ago.  ""We're struggling,"" he said by phone. The Rev. Jose Rodriguez, an Episcopal priest in Orlando whose church helped people who fled after Maria, said hundreds of families affected by the earthquakes have arrived in Central Florida.  ""We're all grasping at straws as to what to do with the earthquake families,"" he said. ""Obviously, it isn't as large of a movement as after Hurricane Maria. ... But these are hundreds of households who are homeless, who are suffering from PTSD, who have been hit by two traumas -- Hurricane Maria and now the earthquakes."" A 10-year-old prays for friends back home That trauma is palpable in Roure's overcrowded Manhattan apartment.  While Sebastian, 10, said he now feels safe, he worries constantly about the fate of friends who stayed behind.  ""I feel bad for them,"" he said. ""They can't travel here. Their families are trying to find where to live."" Quiñones, his mother, said the boy has insisted on sleeping in the same bed as his parents since the first quake in December.  She and her husband, Ismael, 51, are both accountants and left their home in Guayanilla, on the southern Puerto Rican coast. Before boarding the flight with Santiago, they'd lived less than a mile from Inmaculada Concepción church, which partially collapsed. Sebastian was preparing for his First Communion in May.  ""He doesn't know the church collapsed,"" Quiñones said. ""We thought it would be too much to tell him."" The town's Costa Sur Power Plant, which produced more than a quarter of Puerto Rico's electricity, was severely damaged. Most residents have moved outdoors, especially after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7, the strongest to hit the island of about 3 million US citizens  in more than a century . ""Sebastian would start crying at night. Every night,"" his mother recalled. ""The biggest quakes came at night. I would hear him praying for his friends. ... He would ask God to spare us from the earthquakes each night."" They only decided to leave Puerto Rico because of Sebastian, said Quiñones and her husband.  ""If we return, we will not go back to Guayanilla,"" she said. ""He doesn't want to return to the house."" The couple said they will live off their savings for now. They have taken leave from their jobs with the local government and will handle tax return preparation for private clients remotely.  ""Our final decision will be based on how our son adapts to school here,"" said Ismael Quiñones, whose father, four sisters and 19-year-old daughter from a previous marriage remain in Puerto Rico.    ""We invested so much over the years in our home,"" his wife said. ""It's hard to walk away.""  Erratic quakes can be worse than Maria Alejandro Quiles, 40, a retired police officer from the southern coastal town of Guánica, left the island on that same January 14 flight with his wife -- another of Santiago's daughters -- Jeannette, 41, plus their daughter and two sons -- Ronalys, 17; Alejandro, 16; and Alexander, 7. ""It's like the walls were screaming,"" Quiles said of the recurring earthquakes. ""You're constantly thinking about the next one,"" his son, Alejandro, said. ""Will it be bigger? It's not something you forget."" The impact of the uncommon and unpredictable quakes are, for some, worse than the hurricane's aftermath.  ""You can't compare this to Maria,"" Quiles said. ""After the storm ended, you felt safe and knew there would be a recovery. In this case, we don't know when we'll have more earthquakes."" Quiles finally decided to lock up and park the truck from which he sold food at the entrance to the beaches of Guánica in front of his home, which sustained some damage. A house two doors down crumbled to the ground. ""You go to sleep each night thinking about what's going to happen,"" Quiles said. ""Where will we go? Should we stay here? It's stressful not being able to control your life."" His daughter, Ronalys, is a high school senior. She was applying to colleges -- but those plans are now on hold.  ""So many people are not as fortunate as we were,"" Quiles said. ""We're safe now, but in every other sense -- economically, in terms of stability -- we're in limbo."" 17 one-way flights and no lodging plan Days after the first earthquake in late December, his mother-in-law, Santiago, simply couldn't spend another moment in Guánica, the town that took the brunt of the damage from the earthquakes.  ""It was like the walls were coming down,"" she said of the persistent aftershocks.  ""I was worried about her state of mind,"" said her 37-year-old son, Hernan Cortés Quiles. ""I told my sisters, 'We need to get mom off the island.' If I didn't do something, I felt I was going to lose her."" Santiago and about a dozen other family members first moved to Cortés' apartment in the southwestern town of San Germán, which was also feeling the quakes.   ""They were crying all the time,"" Cortés said of his relatives. ""No one wanted to be under a roof. They were sitting outside under the hot sun all the time. They seemed very vulnerable."" Santiago had told her son she would not leave the island without him and her three daughters. So, Cortés, who works for a health plan, said he charged 14 one-way tickets to New York on a credit card at $180 each. Three others covered their own flight costs. He completed the purchase, though, before telling family in New York they'd be coming.  So, Cortés called Roure. ""I said, 'Mami is not well,'"" he recalled, referring to Santiago. ""She said yes."" He drove Santiago home to Guánica to pack her bags. After 10 minutes, she broke down in tears.  ""She said, 'Get me out of this house.'"" he said. ""I was surprised. She lived in that house all her life."" Roure and relatives in New York put money together for expenses. She stocked the refrigerator. She used her connections as an activist for post-Maria medical relief efforts on the island to secure donations of winter clothing.   ""We'll figure it out because we're resilient,"" she said. ""But people need to understand there are thousands of families across the United States in the same situation that no one is noticing. They are US citizens. Many fought in our wars and served our country."" Disasters drive a steady exodus In the six months after Maria, more than 135,000 Puerto Ricans relocated to the US mainland, with 42% landing in Florida, according  estimates in 2018 by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College.      The island has been rocked in recent years by a string of natural disasters, prolonged power outages, economic stagnation, corruption scandals and peaceful anti-government protests that resulted in  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's resignation  in July. ""These events have created a deep sense of insecurity among many residents of the island, which has in turn fueled the outmigration to the US mainland,"" said Jorge Duany, a professor of anthropology at Florida International University. ""Unless the Island can recover quickly from its embattled situation, it will maintain a high rate of migration, and the population will likely continue to decline in the near future."" In the weeks and months after Maria --  which claimed thousands of lives  -- nonprofits and local, state and federal agencies on the mainland mobilized to respond to the influx of hurricane survivors.  ""Since you don't have people dying now, there is not the same sense of urgency,"" said Amílcar Antonio Barreto, a professor at Northeastern University.  ""So, those that decide to move to the US mainland, they're largely going to be left to their own devices and the beneficence of their own family members."" Duany added, ""The growing demand for bilingual teachers, counselors and other staff is one challenge faced by many local schools. Local governments will likewise feel more pressure in their housing and job markets as a result of the increasing exodus."" An 'internalized trauma' pervades Puerto Rico As family members filled out applications for Social Security cards to replace ones they left behind, Roure talked on the phone with a Catholic Charities representative about the help they need. ""Housing is the priority right now,"" she said. ""They need (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. Health insurance and mental health. They have PTSD. We have four school-aged children. I have two senior citizens who can use senior support centers. They don't have all their documents."" ""I'm going to speak to a supervisor, and we'll put our heads together to see what can be provided,"" the representative said. ""They want to work,"" Roure continued. ""These are all people that work. They're not here to live off the system. The kids need therapy. They're traumatized. My aunt is on the verge of a nervous breakdown."" Barreto, who is Puerto Rican, was in San Juan for a conference earlier this month during some of the temblors. He felt a foreboding among residents that was new.  ""It was almost like an internalized trauma,"" he said. ""It's more emotional when people, for example, talk about this relative or that relative who moved to the US mainland or elderly relatives who are like, 'It used to be great to have all the grandkids around, but they're all now on the mainland.' The sense of community and cohesion that folks had has eroded a bit."" On the day Roure's relatives arrived from Puerto Rico two weeks ago, she took them to an awards ceremony where she was honored for her medical relief efforts after Maria. They were exhausted and hungry.   ""'I appreciate this award,'"" she remembered telling a crowd of community activists and local elected officials. ""'But we have the same problem right now. We have a new crisis. I want to recognize my family,'"" she recalled saying as her 17 relatives stood up. ""'They just arrived from Guánica. What can we do for people like them?'"" ""The room,"" she said, ""was in tears."" CNN's  Maria Santana  contributed to this story.

31,Puerto Rico emergency director fired after residents discover warehouse full of Hurricane Maria supplies,Nicole Chavez and Rafy Rivera,1/19/20," Puerto Rico  Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced fired the island's emergency manager, hours after a warehouse filled with supplies was discovered. The emergency aid is believed to be from when  Hurricane Maria  hit the island two years ago, the governor said. Carlos Acevedo, director of Puerto Rico's Office of Emergency Management, was dismissed Saturday. The governor appointed Maj. Gen. José J. Reyes, the adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard, to replace him. Earlier on Saturday, numerous pallets of water and other boxes with emergency supplies were found at a warehouse in the  earthquake ravaged city of Ponce.  Several residents were seen opening the rolling metal doors of the building and calling for authorities to distribute the supplies. Families began lining up Saturday afternoon outside the warehouse, hoping to get bottled water, food and emergency radios,  CNN affiliate WAPA reported. Acevedo has denied allegations of mishandling, saying the agency has been actively distributing supplies, according to a statement released through the office of emergency management. No residents have been denied any supplies in the warehouse, including food, diapers, baby formula and cots, Acevedo said.  He said about 600 pallets of water were distributed when Hurricane Dorian and Hurricane Karen threatened Puerto Rico and during a drought that affected the island last year. Nearly 80 of those pallets remain in the warehouse because they expired, he said.  ""There have not been orders to seize or destroy those items at any point,"" Acevedo said in a statement  Vázquez Garced has directed Secretary of State Elmer Roman to investigate the allegations and share his findings within 48 hours. ""There are thousands of people who made sacrifices to bring aid to the south and it's unforgivable that resources have been kept in a warehouse,""  the governor said in a statement. Puerto Rico has been ravaged by a series of earthquakes since December 28. In the last two weeks, tremors and aftershocks have destroyed or severely damaged hundreds of structures and forced thousands of people in the southern area of the island to flee their homes.  More than 8,000 people have been living in outdoor shelters in the cities of Yauco, Peñuelas, Guánica, Guayanilla and Ponce. Some of those displaced are residents who are too afraid to return home for fear a wall or the roof will collapse. CNN's Rafy Rivera reported from Ponce and Nicole Chavez reported and wrote from Atlanta.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/18/us/puerto-rico-emergency-director-fired/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjl8eOt4sj6AhXJSzABHXvAB3c4oAEQFnoECAkQAg&usg=AOvVaw2M5BmUEDq3414BDnOSKwOZ,CNN,Liberal
32,Earthquake-damaged buildings cripple Puerto Rico,Rafael Romo,1/17/20," The Ponciana Condominium building here is one of the most distinctive in the island's second-largest city. It's a 12-story structure, just south of downtown, with medical and commercial units on its first three floors and residential units on the remaining nine. But after a series of tremors and aftershocks that have rattled Puerto Rico's southern coast since December 28, the tower now sits empty.  Ponce authorities declared it uninhabitable shortly after a mandatory evacuation prompted by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake left cracks and fissures on three sides of the building. Ivette Campos says her elderly aunt was one of those residents who were quickly evacuated. ""They kicked all the residents out as well as people in the doctors' offices, and nobody truly knows what's going to happen with the building,"" Campos said. Mayor María E. Meléndez said that there are areas in Ponce that ""were severely affected and we estimate the damage to be above $200 million, in addition to the losses sustained by businesses that have had to shut their doors."" The Ponciana is one of 23 condominium buildings in Ponce that have sustained structural damage, according to Ángel Vázquez Torres, the local emergency management agency's director. Vázquez told CNN the same happened with an additional 404 houses in the city. The fear is that if there's another major earthquake, some of these structures may collapse, trapping residents or worse. ""Our structural engineers evaluated those sites and indicated to us which ones we had to declare uninhabitable, and we're trying to keep people away from them,"" Vázquez told CNN. Authorities say there also are countless buildings and houses that may have sustained damage that is not visible during the nearly three weeks of daily tremors and aftershocks that have happened in Ponce and towns located on the island's southern coast. The work of detecting the damage in Ponce, Guánica, Guayanilla and Yauco is only beginning. It's another great challenge for Puerto Rico, a US territory that has yet to recover from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which killed nearly 3,000 in September 2017. Buildings that had been damaged by the hurricanes simply collapsed or were left in worse shape by the earthquakes and aftershocks. The same happened to other infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. Deciding what to do next with damaged buildings is still an open question for Puerto Rico. Repairs will be costly and demolishing houses and buildings declared uninhabitable will also cost millions of dollars. After days of waiting, the island got some good news about funding to begin the recovery process. President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon approved a declaration of a major disaster in Puerto Rico. The declaration provides federal funding for six municipalities on the southern coast. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced expressed gratitude. ""We thank the @POTUS for his commitment helping relieve the suffering of our fellow citizens."" Alex Amparo, the top official in the region for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), describes the challenge Puerto Rico now faces in military terms. ""We're in a constant battle, I mean, we're in a fight right now.  The ground is still shaking. I think you saw earlier we had a 5.2 and at the same time we have people who have lost homes,"" Amparo said. While the full extent of the damage continues to be assessed, authorities have to take care of more pressing needs.  There are currently 30 shelters on Puerto Rico's southern coast, holding 8,023 people who were affected by the earthquakes. Shelters in the cities of Yauco, Peñuelas, Guánica, Guayanilla and Ponce provide food, showers, air-conditioned rest areas, psychological counseling and medical services. Some of those displaced are residents who are too afraid to return home for fear a wall or the roof will collapse. But many others are families whose homes are now in ruins, people who are wondering whether they will receive housing assistance from the government or whether they will have to fend for themselves. Luis Vélez told CNN that he and his extended family of more than 20 people, including a disabled uncle, have been living at a shelter opened by local authorities at Ponce Vocational School.  ""We're going to stay here until the ground stops shaking,"" Vélez said. ""We got back on our feet after Hurricane María and, with God's help, we will do the same after this series of earthquakes is over.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/us/puerto-rico-earthquake-damaged-buildings/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiTzobE2Mj6AhWNSjABHaypAyY4MhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw1zC4iY0AUpHqfVn5W-Bvc8,CNN,Liberal
33,"NY governor visits Puerto Rico, authorizes deployment of 115 National Guard to island as temblors continue",Ray Sanchez,1/14/20," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo authorized the deployment of 115 National Guard members to Puerto Rico and arrived on the island for a visit Tuesday as aftershocks continue to jolt the US territory.  The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said power has been restored to 99% of its customers. But nearly 5,000 people are still living in shelters, according to Secretary of State Elmer Roman, CNN affiliate WIPR reported.     Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced  declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard one week ago , after a 6.4 magnitude quake shook the island, killing at least one person, destroying homes and leaving most utility customers in the dark. ""Our point is going to be, anybody we can help,"" Cuomo told reporters before leaving New York on Tuesday. ""In terms of health resources, mental health resources, structural engineers, power supply, emergency responses -- that's the purpose of this visit."" Cuomo, who will tour the hardest-hit municipalities in the southern part of the island, said he had authorized the deployment for the next 90 days. The governor last week  deployed a team  from the New York Power Authority to Puerto Rico.   The New York delegation, which includes local leaders and elected officials, is also providing 800 blankets, 800 pillows and 500 emergency preparedness packs with emergency first aid kits, radios, gloves and masks, according to Cuomo's office.    New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday the city will have a team of 28 people on the island, including 16 building inspectors and engineers, nine emergency managers and two mental health professionals.  California  Gov. Gavin Newsom last weekend sent 35 disaster specialists  to Puerto Rico.  Since December 28,  about 500 earthquakes  of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, which is still  recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. The quakes have renewed fear and anxiety among residents in the southern towns of the island.  Vázquez Garced has said the temblors caused an estimated $110 million in damage.  Thousands of families have fled their homes, fearing the structures may collapse during an aftershock. They are sleeping in tents and tarps set up in stadiums, in fields and next to highways.

34,California sent 35 disaster specialists to Puerto Rico after earthquakes shook the island for nearly a week,Hollie Silverman,1/13/20," California sent 35 disaster specialists to Puerto Rico following a  series of earthquakes  that have caused extensive damage and power outages on the Island. Governor Gavin Newsom announced the plan Saturday after a 5.9 earthquake  shook the island  still recovering from a week of quakes and tremblors. The team of specialists departed from Sacramento International Airport for San Juan, Puerto Rico Sunday morning, according to tweets from the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. ""California stands with the people of Puerto Rico,"" Governor Newsom said in the press release. ""Our nation-sized state knows first-hand the devastating toll of natural disasters and we will provide aid and support as our brothers and sisters rebuild and recover."" Disaster specialists from different fields  Those on the team include experts in incident and emergency management, engineering and safety assessment, planning, and public information as well as debris management and crisis counseling, a  press release from the agency said.  The team will deploy for 16 days and will include members of the California Department of Social Services, CalRecycle, Caltrans and the Division of the State Architect within the Department of General Services, according to the release. ""The destruction by these earthquakes is clearly severe and widespread,"" Cal OES Director Mark Ghilarducci said in the release. ""Here in California, we have some of the most talented and experienced emergency management staff in the world. We are ready to provide their valuable skill sets to our partners in Puerto Rico."" Earlier in the week, four California Urban Search and Rescue team members from Sacramento City Fire and the Orange County Fire Authority were dispatched to Puerto Rico to assist with search and rescue operations.  The possibility of more quakes has increased Following Saturday's quake the United States Geological Service reported that the probability for an aftershock of 6.0 magnitude of higher in Puerto Rico had increased to 12%. There is a 4% chance of one or more aftershocks larger than a 6.4 magnitude, according to an  aftershock forecast  released by the agency. The 5.9 magnitude shock increased the risk and changed the seven day forecast previously put out by the agency. USGS also announced that a 3.0 magnitude or greater aftershock was ""highly likely"" after Saturday's quake.  The rate of aftershocks will decline over time but may be felt near the epicenters, the aftershock forecast said. Any additional large aftershocks would change the forecast again. Estimates of $110 million in damages Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced signed a major disaster declaration on Saturday, asking the federal government for additional federal aid for the southern towns of Guanica, Guayanilla, Peñuelas, Ponce and Yauco. The governor told reporters there is an estimated $110 million in damage caused by the quakes. She  declared a state of emergency  and activated the National Guard after a 6.4 magnitude quake struck Tuesday, killing at least one man, destroying homes and leaving most of the island without power.  By Sunday, power had been restored to 97.9% of the island,  a tweet from The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority  (Autoridad de Energia Electrica) said.

35,Another earthquake hits Puerto Rico with 5.9 magnitude,"Nicole Chavez, Maria Santana and Jay Croft",1/11/20," An 5.9 magnitude earthquake rattled Puerto Rico on Saturday, fueling anxiety among residents and sending them running in terror. The quake was about 8 miles south of Indios in the Caribbean Sea,   the US Geological Survey said, at a depth of 6.2 miles. The USGS first said the preliminary magnitude was 6.0. In photos: Persistent earthquakes put Puerto Rico on edge Puerto Rico has been  beset by temblors throughout the week , including a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday   that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power. A 5.2 magnitude aftershock struck on Friday afternoon. As of Saturday afternoon, about 59,000 customers remain without power, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority officials said.  The earthquake renewed fear and anxiety among residents in the southern towns of the island.  As the ground shook on Saturday, people at Mercedita International Airport in Ponce quickly ran outside the terminal, and a few miles away, parts of the roof and facade of a historic building collapsed. Luis Emanuelli, who owns a restaurant in the building, said that while the interior was not damaged, he and his team decided pick up a few documents, some equipment and close indefinitely. ""We don't know what we are exposed to,"" he said. The US territory was expecting power to return by Saturday to its 3 million residents, and authorities had tweeted that it was 95% restored a couple of hours before Saturday's quake at about 8 a.m. ET. Parts of Lares, Adjuntas, Ponce and San German lost electrical service after the new quake. After the tremor, power was on to about 93% of the island, PREPA said. Governor estimates $110 million in damages Amid the earthquakes, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced signed a major disaster declaration on Saturday, asking the federal government for additional federal aid for the southern towns of Guanica, Guayanilla, Peñuelas, Ponce and Yauco. The governor told reporters there is an estimated $110 million in damage caused by the quakes. Earlier this week, Vázquez Garced had  declared a state of emergency  and activated the National Guard. She warned businesses against price gouging after saying there have been reports of tent prices rising. ""I urge those people to have sensitivity. We want to assure the well-being of people who lost their property, don't have a roof and are choosing to sleep in a park and need at least an awning to cover themselves from the sun and rain,"" the governor said in Spanish. People are camping on sidewalks, stadiums and highways Thousands of families have fled their homes, fearing the structures may collapse during an aftershock. They are sleeping in mattresses, tents and tarps set up in stadiums, fields and next to highways.  A baseball stadium in Guayanilla as well as public parks and schools across the southern towns have become massive shelters in the past days. Scores of people are sleeping in cots under large white tents and dozens of portable bathroom have been set up. More than 6,000 people were staying in shelters, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, the territory's nonvoting delegate to Congress, said. Since December 28,  about 500 earthquakes  of magnitude 2.0 or higher have hit Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from  Hurricane Maria in 2017 . That storm killed almost 3,000 people, and left millions of Americans without power, water or shelter. Recovery has been slow and hard. Airbnb offers free housing on the island Airbnb's Open Homes program is offering free, temporary housing in Puerto Rico, its site says. ""Relief workers, neighbors who've had to evacuate, and others impacted by the event"" are eligible to book rooms at no cost, Airbnb says. ""If you've been displaced or are helping with relief efforts, you can book free accommodations between January 9, 2020 and January 31, 2020.""

11,Magnitude 5.9 Shock Rocks Quake-Stunned Puerto Rico,Danica Coto,1/11/20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A magnitude 5.9 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing further damage along the island’s southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools.The U.S. Geological Survey said the 8:54 a.m. (1254 GMT) quake hit 8 miles (13 kilometers) southeast of Guanica at a shallow depth of 3 miles (5 kilometers).Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants.Bárbara Cruz, a prosecutor who was in the southern coastal city of Ponce when the new quake hit, said concrete debris hit the sidewalk as buildings continued to crumble.“Everyone is out on the street,” she said.There were no immediate reports of injuries.The quake, which initially had been calculated at magnitude 6.0, was the strongest shake yet since a magnitude 6.4 quake — the strongest to hit the island in a century — struck before dawn on Tuesday, knocking out power across Puerto Rico and leaving many without water. More than 2,000 people remain in shelters, many fearful of returning to their homes, and others unable to because of extensive damage.Hundreds of quakes have shaken the island since the new year, though most were too slight to be felt.NASA reported Friday that the quakes had moved the land in parts of southern Puerto Rico as much as 5.5 inches (14 centimeters), based on satellite images before and after the temblors.Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that he expects still more aftershocks as a result of the latest large one.“It’s going to re-energize an unstable situation,” he said, adding that seismologists are studying which faults were activated. “It’s a complex zone.”Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still without power and water, and thousands are staying in shelters and sleeping on sidewalks since Tuesday’s earthquake. That temblor killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island’s southwest region.

36,5.2 aftershock hits Puerto Rico days after earthquake,"Madeline Holcombe, Nicole Chavez and Ray Sanchez",1/10/20," A 5.2 magnitude aftershock hit Puerto Rico's southern coast on Friday afternoon, days after an earthquake shook the island and left much of it without power. A CNN crew said its truck moved during the aftershock, one of the strongest since Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude quake. The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude down from an earlier 5.4 reading. The aftershock came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is making aid available and assisting with damage assessment  after the quake rocked the island  before dawn on Tuesday. It was one of about 500 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater that have rattled the area since December 28, according to the US Geological Survey.  The earthquake left one man dead, caused dozens of homes and other structures to crumble and left about two-thirds of residents in the dark. The US territory, still recovering from the damage caused by  Hurricane Maria in 2017 , expects to return power to all of its 3 million residents by Saturday, according to utility officials.  Quake sends residents to sleep in their yards Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. For many, that has meant bringing mattresses, tents and tarps into their yards to sleep, for fear   of what aftershocks could do to their already damaged homes. Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate to Congress, spoke at a news conference Friday with Vázquez and Florida Sen. Rick Scott after touring the damaged Costa Sur Power Plant. She said more than 6,000 people were staying in shelters.   Vázquez said she had spoken with President Donald Trump to thank him for his support and to urge his prompt approval of a major disaster declaration.  Myrna Delgado said she sought refuge outside her home when the first temblors started on December 28. She slept in a van and then at a stadium shelter in the southwestern city of Yauco.  ""I'm very nervous,"" she told CNN on Friday. ""At night I feel very depressed. We don't have light at home. With the company of other people, at least we feel safe.""  Noelia de Jesus and her granddaughters are also among those in a shelter. They are also among the many who are looking for a place to stay for the third time, having lost their homes when Hurricane George struck in 1998 and again during Hurricane Maria.  Luis Garcia, a resident of the southern coastal city of Guayanilla, said he was finding it harder to secure basics such as gas and food than after Hurricane Maria in 2017.  The tremors may not be over The US Geological Survey  (USGS) has modeled three forecasts of what may be in store for Puerto Rico over the next month. The most likely scenario, the USGS said, is that the aftershocks will continue to decrease in frequency; and though there may be medium and small quakes, there will not be another earthquake like Tuesday's in this sequence. USGS said the probability of this scenario is 84%. There a 14% chance of what is called a doublet, which is two large earthquakes of a similar size occurring in a similar location, the USGS said. Meaning there is a case in which the region could see another quake as powerful as 6.4 magnitude.  Least likely is that Tuesday's earthquake could trigger an even larger one. While the probability is small, the impacts of that scenario would be devastating, the USGS said. ""The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures such as unreinforced masonry buildings,""  the agency said . Power out and schools closed As Puerto Rico waits to see what may follow, officials are aiming to  restore power by the end of the weekend. Power has been restored to about 80 percent of Puerto Rico's 1.4 million utility customers across the island, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority said via Twitter on Friday, but the goal is for everyone to have power on Saturday.  Three of the territory's major power plants are expected to be in service again by Saturday, with a fourth aimed at operating on Sunday, power utility CEO Jose Ortiz said.  But the plant that supplies about a quarter of the island's power, Costa Sur Power Plant, suffered extensive damage and could be out of commission for a year, Ortiz said in an interview aired on  ""CBS This Morning."" Officials are also working to reopen schools, which have canceled classes until crews can inspect buildings and ensure their safety for students. ""Classes in the public school system won't resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,"" Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won't return to the schools until further notice.

39,Satellite images show how dark Puerto Rico is at night after earthquakes caused power outages,Paul P. Murphy,1/9/20," Satellite images taken at night are showing just how much of Puerto Rico doesn't have any power.  Some people may be without power  for over a year . About two-thirds of Puerto Rico is without power  after strong earthquakes  and aftershocks rocked the southwestern shore of the island  Tuesday morning , Puerto Rico Electric Power said. An unknown number of people do not have water service, either. If you are unable to view the satellite images in your browser, click  here . That's because the Costa Sur power plant near Guayanilla, the largest power plant on the island, was severely damaged by the earthquakes on Tuesday, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced said.   Jose Ortiz, executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority (PREPA), told CBS News Thursday that the earthquake damage, in addition to a lack of equipment updates to the 60-year-old facility, is what is keeping the plant offline. Earthquake damage could leave major Puerto Rico power plant out of action for a year, official says PREPA's engineering director Daniel Hernandez says about 75% of homes in Puerto Rico should have power by the weekend.  But Ortiz told CBS News on Thursday he expects that parts of Puerto Rico will be without power for more than a year.  The satellite imagery taken by NASA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite early Tuesday morning—before the power plant was knocked offline—shows what Puerto Rico looks like on a normal, clear night.  But imagery from Wednesday, after the strong earthquakes and aftershocks shook the island on Monday and Tuesday, shows lights on the island are considerably dimmer.  Puerto Rico remained considerably dark in early Thursday morning satellite imagery. It looks nearly unchanged to the imagery from Wednesday.  Comparing Tuesday's imagery to Thursday's imagery shows just how drastic the power outages are, and how little power has been restored.  After  Hurricane Maria  tore through the island in September 2017,  it took 11 months  for power to be fully restored in Puerto Rico.

38,"Earthquake damage could leave major Puerto Rico power plant out of action for a year, official says",Dakin Andone,1/9/20," A crucial Puerto Rico power plant damaged in this week's earthquakes could be out of operation for more than a year, the head of the island's electricity authority told CBS News.  Power has been restored to  about 50% of customers after a series of earthquakes since December 28 , an official with the utility said Thursday.  With three major power plants expected to return to service between Thursday and Saturday, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority CEO Jose Ortiz said the entire US territory -- with about 3 million residents -- could have power by the weekend. A fourth could begin operating by Sunday, he said.  ""The target is for Saturday to have everybody with power,"" Ortiz told CNN.  But the Costa Sur Power Plant in Guayanilla  suffered extensive damage  in this week's quakes. And the facility, which provides about a quarter of the island's power, ""will be out for probably over a year,"" Ortiz said in an interview that aired on  ""CBS This Morning."" Another complicating factor is the fact the plant's equipment is decades old, Ortiz said.  ""To be honest, those plants have over 60 years, basically,"" he said. ""Imagine you have a taxi, 60 years old, and you are required to run that 24/7.""  The plant's operations manager, Angel Perez, appeared to differ on the timeline in a separate interview with CBS, saying it would be ""no less than a month."" He said they would work ""24 hours around the clock"" to get the plant back up and running. Officials are expected to hold a news conference to provide an update on their efforts to restore power. Hundreds of tremors have struck Puerto Rico since December 28, with Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude quake being the strongest and likely the most damaging. The quake, centered off the southern coast, left one man dead and caused dozens of homes and structures to crumble.

37,Power expected to return to all of Puerto Rico in days after deadly earthquake and aftershocks,"Nicole Chavez, Camila Bernal and Eliott C. McLaughlin",1/9/20," Power is expected to be slowly restored to all homes in Puerto Rico over the coming days in the aftermath of a 6.4 magnitude earthquake that left many residents sleeping outside their homes and more than 2,000 others in shelters. The strongest and likely  most damaging of hundreds of temblors  that have struck the island since December 28 hit before dawn Tuesday. It left one man dead and caused dozens of homes and other structures to crumble.  With three major power plants expected to return to service between Thursday and Saturday, Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority CEO Jose Ortiz said the entire US territory -- with about 3 million residents -- could have power by the weekend.   A fourth plant could begin operating by Sunday, he said.  ""The target is for Saturday to have everybody with power,"" Ortiz told CNN Thursday.  Power has now been restored to about 700,000 of Puerto Rico's 1.4 million utility customers across the island, according to Ortiz.  For many Puerto Ricans still rebuilding after 2017's Hurricane Maria claimed thousands of lives and left much of the island in the dark for months, the uncertainly following the latest disaster recalls the post-storm trauma.  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico in  response to the earthquakes. ""We are concerned about potential impacts of this week's earthquakes on the lives of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Across HHS, we have worked closely with the territory's health and human services authorities on disaster recovery and will continue to do everything we can to help ensure the health and well-being of people across the island,"" he said.  Tuesday's earthquake was centered off Puerto Rico's southern coast, six miles south of Indios. Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night under white tents and tarps.  ""We know the earthquakes will continue; we don't know their intensity,"" Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced told reporters Thursday.    Noelia de Jesus has been sleeping at an outdoors shelter with her granddaughters, terrified of returning to her home in Guanica. It's the third time that a natural disaster leaves her without a place to live. Like her, many Puerto Ricans lost their homes when Hurricane Maria hit and Hurricane George struck in 1998. The Puerto Rico Department of Housing said  2,204 people have sought refuge in 18 shelters.    Worse than Maria, some say Residents and officials have repeatedly said the impact from the quakes surpasses the devastation that Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm when it hit the island, delivered two years ago.  ""With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,"" Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, ""This, you don't know at what time it's going to happen."" The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn't been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don't know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said.  ""There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,"" she said. ""(They're) starting again from zero."" Classes have not resumed  Classes won't resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students, education officials announced. The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage, including a partially collapsed, three-story building.  ""Classes in the public school system won't resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,"" Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won't return to the schools until further notice.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts. President Donald Trump's action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

42,More than 500 earthquakes have rattled the Puerto Rico region in 10 days. There may be more to come,Faith Karimi,1/8/20," A 6.4 magnitude  earthquake that killed one person in Puerto Rico  on Tuesday is one of hundreds of tremors that have rattled the island for more than a week. And experts say the shaking is not over yet. The latest earthquake struck during the predawn hours, flattening homes, knocking out power in some areas and  jolting awake terrified residents. Just a day earlier, a magnitude 5.8 quake hit off the island's southwestern coast. Since December 28, more  than 500 earthquakes  of magnitude 2 or greater have rattled the area, according  to the US Geological Survey.  Many of them were relatively shallow, which means they were likely felt on land.  Of the hundreds of earthquakes, 32 were magnitude 4 and above,  including the ones Monday and Tuesday. ""Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in this same region, beginning in earnest with a magnitude 4.7 earthquake late on December 28 and a magnitude 5.0 event a few hours later,"" the USGS said.  ""With the exception of the latest two earthquakes ... none are likely to have caused significant damage,"" it added.  Puerto Rico sits on an unusual spot, which makes its vulnerable to earthquakes.  ""Tectonics in Puerto Rico are dominated by the convergence between the North America and Caribbean plates, with the island being squeezed between the two,"" the USGS said. ""To the north of Puerto Rico, North America subducts beneath the Caribbean plate along the Puerto Rico trench. To the south of the island, ... Caribbean plate upper crust subducts beneath Puerto Rico at the Muertos Trough."" And the USGS said the latest earthquake could be part of a sequence, which could mean larger and potentially  damaging earthquakes in the future.   ""Over the next one week, there is a 7% chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 6.4. It is likely that there will be many smaller earthquakes over the next one week,"" the USGS said. ""Magnitude 3 and above events are large enough to be felt near the epicenter.""

41,Ways you can help those impacted by Puerto Rico's earthquakes,Lauren Lee,1/8/20," Back-to-back earthquakes  in Puerto Rico have added to the devastation left by  Hurricane Maria  in 2017. A  6.4 magnitude earthquake  and several other strong tremors on January 7 killed one man and crumbled dozens of homes and structures. Many residents are without power and water;  some are sleeping outside  in fear of more structural collapses and aftershocks.  While many organizations are still on the ground following Maria, more aid is needed to support the immediate and long-term needs of earthquake victims.

40,Puerto Rico earthquake: Roughly two-thirds of island without power amid dozens of aftershocks,"Nicole Chavez, Camila Bernal and Eliott C. McLaughlin",1/8/20," Roughly two-thirds of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, many still don't have water and frightened residents were staying outside as  a series of aftershocks rocked the island  following a magnitude 6.4 earthquake. The quake was the strongest and likely the  most damaging of hundreds of temblors  that have struck the island since December 28. It hit before dawn Tuesday, leaving a man dead and causing dozens of homes and structures to crumble.  It was centered off Puerto Rico's southern coast, 6 miles south of Indios. Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with residents to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks.  Terrified of sleeping indoors as aftershocks continue, neighbors put mattresses in their front yards while others spent the night Tuesday under white tents and tarps.  Noelia de Jesus has been sleeping at an outdoors shelter with her granddaughters, terrified of returning to her Guanica home. ""I've been crying ever since it happened,"" de Jesus told CNN. ""Everything is broken...the house is leaning to the right. If another (earthquake) comes, it's going to go down."" It's the third time that a natural disaster leaves her without a place to live. Like her, many Puerto Ricans lost their homes when Hurricane Maria hit the island two years ago and Hurricane George struck in 1998.  Guanica Mayor Santos Seda said about 50 homes were destroyed by the earthquake and at least 100 more were ""about to collapse"" on Wednesday. Hundreds of aftershocks have hit the area in the past few days. As of Wednesday afternoon, the island in just 24 hours had experienced about 50 seismic events of magnitude 2.5 or higher, the US Geological Survey said. A  4.7 earthquake  was reported Wednesday afternoon off the southern coast of the island, about 8 miles southeast of Tallaboa, USGS said. The National Weather Service office in San Juan said there was  no tsunami threat.   Worse than Maria, some say Residents and officials have repeatedly said the impact from the quakes surpasses the devastation that Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm when it hit the island, delivered two years ago.  ""With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive,"" Guayanilla resident Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, said, adding of the quakes, ""This, you don't know at what time it's going to happen."" The town of 18,000 located near the southern coast hasn't been getting regular updates, she said. Residents are disinclined to leave their homes because they don't know what areas are safe. Rodriguez worries that recovery will be difficult, especially for those hit hard by Maria, she said.  ""There are a lot of people that started from zero because of Maria,"" she said. ""(They're) starting again from zero."" Ashley Ramirez Perez, 22, hasn't seen her partner since Saturday. He was receiving treatment at a clinic in Guanica, about 12 miles west of Guayanilla, but patients were moved after the quakes and she doesn't know where he is. She doesn't think he knows where she is, either, she said.  Perez and her relatives, including her 58-year-old father, took shelter at Gloria Maria Borrero School in Guayanilla after Perez's apartment began ""separating from the sidewalk,"" she said. She's been without power for two days, and the balcony of her apartment is ""a bit toppled"" as well, she told CNN on Tuesday.  ""I never thought a quake would destroy so much,"" she said. ""Hurricane Maria was nothing compared to this."" Water and power still an issue Much of Puerto Rico is still without power Wednesday as engineers work to restore it in phases. About 500,000 customers, roughly one-third of the island, are back on the grid, the Electric Energy Authority said in a tweet.  A system-wide power outage was reported after the Costa Sur power plant near Guayanilla suffered severe damage Tuesday, Vázquez Garced said. ""We lost the largest plant in the entire system,"" said Jose Ortiz, executive director of the Electric Power Authority.  Power has been restored in most hospitals, and crews are working to fully restore it by the weekend, Ortiz said. A nursing home in Ponce was evacuated and dozens of people in wheelchairs were waiting outside.  Guanica experienced at least 10 aftershocks Wednesday before 8 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Mayor Seda said.  More than 200 people took shelter at a Guanica coliseum, he said, but fearful for their safety if the building were toppled, they relocated to the parking lot. ""So much worse than Maria, because a hurricane, we can tell where the hurricane is coming through, but we don't with an earthquake,"" Seda told CNN. ""Yesterday, my wife and I slept on the sidewalk right outside my house, and we saw the same thing everywhere."" Classes have not resumed  Classes won't resume across the island until crews inspect all schools and confirm buildings are safe for students, education officials announced. The Agripina Seda School in Guanica suffered major damage Tuesday, including a partially collapsed, three-story building.  ""Classes in the public school system won't resume until a total evaluation of all campuses,"" Education Secretary Eligio Hernández Pérez tweeted, adding that teachers and staff won't return to the schools until further notice.  Damage worse than hurricane, official says The earthquakes come after  Hurricane Maria  devastated the US territory in September 2017. Many in southern Puerto Rico said the earthquakes' damage was worse.   ""There's no warnings for this,"" Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said of the earthquakes. ""A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead."" When asked what concerns him the most about the quakes' aftermath, he said, ""That homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person's death or serious injuries."" The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced aid has been made available to supplement local response efforts. President Donald Trump's action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures to save lives and protect property.

43,"A deadly earthquake has most of Puerto Rico with no power, no water and residents fear tremors will bring more destruction","Leyla Santiago, Nicole Chavez and Jason Hanna",1/7/20," Hours after a deadly  6.4 magnitude earthquake  rocked Puerto Rico, people on the southern coast fear more homes could collapse and most of the people on the island remain without power. Tuesday's quake -- the strongest and likely the most damaging of a series of quakes that have hit the island since December 28 -- left a man dead, caused dozens of homes and structures to crumble and cut power and water service to swaths of the island.  Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency and activated the Puerto Rico National Guard as she pleaded with people to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks.  ""We have responded to many difficult situations, and here we are once again,"" Vázquez said. Engineers were working to reestablish service to close to 300,000 of the island's 1.1 million utility customers who were without water service Tuesday, Vázquez said.  The 6.4 quake struck at 4:24 a.m. (3:24 a.m. ET). It centered off Puerto Rico's southern coast, about 6 miles south Indios, a town of about 1,500 people, the  US Geological Survey said . Several aftershocks followed, including a magnitude 5.6 temblor striking south of Indios at 7:18 a.m.,  USGS said .  In Guanica, families sat on white plastic chairs and cots in the parking lot of the Mariano ""Tito"" Rodriguez Municipal Coliseum. About 255 have taken shelter there since a  5.8 magnitude quake shook the US territory  Monday, but officials now fear the building is not stable.  ""My home is like a hammock,"" Guanica resident Hector Cruz said. ""It's like a drill coming from underneath the home."" The earthquakes come after  Hurricane Maria  devastated the US territory in September 2017, and many in southern Puerto Rico say the earthquakes' damage is worse.  ""There's no warnings for this,"" Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Henry Escalera said about the earthquakes. ""A hurricane gives us time to plan ahead."" When asked what concerns him most about the quakes' aftermath, Escalera said, ""That homes will not be safe to live in and the possibility of a collapse that will cause a person's death or serious injuries."" 1 dead, homes and church collapsed In Ponce, roughly a 15-mile drive east of Indios, a 77-year-old man was killed and at least eight others were injured Tuesday, the city's emergency management director, Angel Vasquez, said. More than 400,000 of Puerto Rico's 3.1 million people would have felt strong shaking, the USGS estimates, though the entire island would have felt lesser effects. Authorities provided tents to help residents sleep outdoors Tuesday night, Guanica Deputy Mayor Zulma Bracero said. Nothing seems safe, she said, and the situation is worse than Maria's aftermath. Riko Gonzalez and his parents were sleeping in their home in Yauco, near Indios, when the 6.4 quake struck. They awoke to a rumble and scurried out of the house. China and glasses smashed on the kitchen floor, he said. It was ""horrible, nothing compared to the (magnitude) 5s from yesterday,"" Gonzalez said. ""People are afraid to go to bed, to then be woken up to worse earthquakes than the day before."" In Guayanilla, north of Indios, the Inmaculada Conception Church was in ruins. Part of an exterior wall collapsed, and piles of rubble lay on the ground, pictures posted to Facebook show. Homes also were damaged in Guayanilla, Mayor Nelson Torres told  CNN affiliate WAPA . The Guayanilla area already was counting losses from a day earlier. A significant tourist attraction, the coastal  Punta Ventana rock formation and arch , collapsed in Monday's shaking, the mayor said. Workers at Hospital Damas in Ponce were evacuating all patients except for those in intensive care, Executive Director Dr. Pedro Benitez told WAPA. ""(Patients) were running around the hallways, so we had to get them out of the building for their own safety,"" he said. It could be the worst quake in more than 100 years Tuesday's quake continues a series of seismic events that have shaken Puerto Rico for 11 days. Hundreds of small earthquakes have hit the island since December 28, the USGS says, including at least 29 over magnitude 4.0. Monday morning 's 5.8 tremor struck south of Indios. The quake damaged some homes in Guanica and Guayanilla, but no serious injuries were reported. The earthquakes appear to have been foreshocks to Tuesday morning's larger quake, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. Tuesday's quake ""will trigger aftershocks, but these will decrease in frequency over time,"" the USGS said. It likely will be the island's most damaging earthquake in a century.  In 1918, a strong quake shook Puerto Rico, causing a tsunami and resulting in 116 deaths and economic loss of $4 million, two times the island's annual budget at the time, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. That's about $73 million today. It's the largest earthquake to hit Puerto Rico since 2014, when a 6.4 magnitude quake struck 61 miles northeast of the island. It briefly disrupted power but caused only minor damage to Puerto Rico, as it was centered much father off shore than Tuesday's earthquake. Puerto Rico could see billions of dollars in damage, expert says The full extent of damages is unclear, but experts say the island could need hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. One expert, Chuck Watson, an analyst with Georgia-based disaster research group Enki Research, believes the quakes could cost the island up to $3.1 billion in losses, he said. The estimate includes damage to public and private property, and lost tourism, wages and business due to power outages. USGS estimates the earthquakes could cause  losses of more than $100 million.  Watson's estimate includes how multiple aftershocks can potentially damage weak structures, as well as the lingering damage left by Hurricane Maria, he said. Some of the infrastructure damage from the 2017 storm still is not repaired, the American Society of Civil Engineers says. Following hurricanes Irma and Maria, Congress appropriated $42 billion to the recovery effort, $16 billion of which went through FEMA, $20 billion through Housing and Urban Development, and the remainder through more than a dozen smaller agencies. Only about $14 billion of the funds has been spent. CNN's Leyla Santiago reported from Puerto Rico, Nicole Chavez and Jason Hanna reported and wrote from Atlanta.

12,6.4 Quake Strikes Puerto Rico Amid Heavy Seismic Activity,AP,1/7/20,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, and was followed three hours later by an aftershock measuring 6.0. They are the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the U.S. territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas.Eight people were injured in the city of Ponce, near the epicenter of the quake, Mayor Mayita Meléndez told WAPA television.Puerto Rico’s power authority said on Twitter that one of the country’s main power plants, which sits near the epicenter, had been damaged, but officials expect to restore power to the island later Tuesday.The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at 4:24 a.m. just south of the island at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers. It initially gave the magnitude as 6.6 but later adjusted it. At 7:18 a.m. the magnitude-6.0 aftershock hit the same area. People reported strong shaking and staff at a local radio station said live on air that they were leaving their buildingA tsunami alert was issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after the initial quake, but was later canceled.Albert Rodríguez, who is from the southwest town of Guánica, said the tsunami sirens went off before officials canceled the alert. He said there is widespread damage in his neighborhood.“The road is cracked in the middle and it lifted up,” he said.The mayor of Guayanilla, Nelson Torres, told NotiUno radio station that the church in the public plaza of his town collapsed.Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told The Associated Press that it is hard to obtain reports of damage or injuries because communications are down for much of the island. He said officials in Ponce told him there was widespread damage.“We expect that this will be the largest quake for now,” he said. “The aftershocks will continue for some time.”Puerto Rico’s governor, Wanda Vasquez, told station Radioisla just before 6 a.m. that there had been no immediate reports of deaths. She ordered government offices closed for the day and urged citizens to remain calm and not check damage to their homes until daylight.A 5.8-magnitude quake that struck early Monday morning collapsed five homes in the southwest coastal town of Guánica and heavily damaged dozens of others. It also caused small landslides and power outages. The quake was followed by a string of smaller temblors.The shake collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in the southwest town of Guayanilla.Residents in the south of the island have been terrified to go into their homes for fear that another quake will bring buildings down.The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico’s southern region began the night of Dec. 28. Huérfano told the AP that shallow quakes were occurring along three faults in Puerto Rico’s southwest region: Lajas Valley, Montalva Point and the Guayanilla Canyon.He said the quakes overall come as the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeeze Puerto Rico.One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
45,"Puerto Rico rocked by a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, with more tremors expected",Holly Yan,1/6/20," A damaging earthquake struck Puerto Rico early Monday, with plenty of aftershocks expected.  The magnitude 5.8 tremor happened at 5:32 a.m. ET, the US Geological Survey said.   It was centered about 8 miles south-southeast of Indios, Puerto Rico, at a depth of about 3.7 miles below ground. No major injuries were reported, Puerto Rico Director of Emergency Management Carlos Acevedo said.  He said some homes were damaged in Guanica, and a home collapsed in Guayanilla.  Some victims of the earthquake posted photos of deep cracks in walls.  There were also reports of rock slides along Route 2, Acevedo said.  No tsunami warning  was issued after the quake. But geologists warn of more tremors to come.  ""More earthquakes than usual (called aftershocks) will continue to occur near the mainshock,""  the USGS  said.  ""When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater.""

13,Puerto Rico's Population Grows For First Time In 15 Years,Sanjana Karanth,12/30/19,"Puerto Rico’s population increased in 2019 for the first time in nearly 15 years, according to a federal statistics report released Monday.The United States territory of 3.2 million people experienced a slight population increase of 0.01%, or 340 inhabitants, from 2018 to 2019, according to the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics. The institute collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau as part of the Federal State Cooperative for Population Estimates by providing necessary information related to Puerto Rico’s count.Puerto Rico had seen a total population drop of more than 630,000 since its peak in 2004, as more people decided to migrate to the U.S. mainland ― particularly Florida ― amid an economic recession that weakened the island for more than a dozen years starting in 2006. In 2017, the island was more than $70 billion in debt and had an unemployment rate of about 10%, which was more than twice the national rate.The exodus intensified when the island was ravaged by Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma, disasters that left Puerto Rico with few resources, a high death toll and very little help from the Trump administration.Puerto Rico’s government faced intense criticism from residents over its lack of transparency regarding the death toll from Maria, initially putting the number at 64 people. But a New York Times report from December 2017 said that 1,052 more people died across the island as a result of the hurricane, and a Harvard research study from June 2018 put the number even higher, at 4,645. The Puerto Rican government eventually acknowledged in August 2018 that 2,975 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.The island saw a historic net migration loss last year after the Category 4 storm, with a 3.9% decline. About 123,000 more people left than moved to Puerto Rico from 2017 to 2018, compared with 78,000 the previous year, according to the Pew Research Center. The net migration loss in Puerto Rico didn’t pass 6,000 each year from 2000 to 2009.Census projections from 2017 had estimated the island’s population would decline to less than 3 million by 2050, making the slight increase in Monday’s report a significant change.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-population-grows-first-time-15-years_n_5e0ac7c5e4b0843d360b2c8a,HuffPost,Liberal
14,CVS Clerk Refused To Sell Medicine To College Student With Puerto Rico Driver's License,Mary Papenfuss,11/5/19,"A Purdue University engineering student was stunned when a CVS drugstore clerk in Indiana prohibited him from buying medicine because he didn’t have a visa to go with his Puerto Rico driver’s license.Last month, the unidentified clerk at a West Lafayette store refused to sell over-the-counter cold medicine to Jose Guzman Payano because she was convinced he was an immigrant, the engineering student told NBC Indianapolis affiliate WTHR.“She said she needed a U.S.-issued ID, Canada or Mexico license. That’s when I tell her that was a U.S.-issued license, and I didn’t need anything else,” Guzman Payano said. “When she asked me for a visa, I was in shock.”Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.Because he had encountered similar problems before, Guzman Payano carries his passport in his backpack, which he said he also presented. The clerk refused to accept that because he had no proof of his “immigration” status.The incident circulated on social media after his mother complained about it on Facebook. “My son, or any other consumer, is not obligated to disclose his immigration status to any CVS employee!” wrote Arlene Payano Burgos. “Whatever triggered her to discriminate against my son embodies exactly what is wrong in the United States of America today.”CVS has since apologized to Guzman Payano and his mother.In a statement emailed to NBC, Amy Thibault, the chain’s senior manager of corporate communications, said:While we are confident that this was an isolated incident, we will be reiterating to all of our stores the correct procedures to follow when requesting identification that is required by law for certain transactions, as well as the forms of identification we accept, including IDs issued by U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico.“I guess I should be thankful that he wasn’t thrown in the back of an ICE van and interrogated, or worse,” Payano Burgos wrote on Facebook.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
46,Puerto Rico unveils plans to pull the island out of bankruptcy,Donna Borak,9/27/19,"Washington (CNN Business) The federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances on Friday released a plan that would cut the island's debt by more than 60% and rescue it from bankruptcy. The highly-anticipated restructuring plan comes three years after Congress created the federal oversight board, which allowed the territory to seek bankruptcy protection after years of facing its inability to pay its debt.  Puerto Rico was dragged into billions of dollars in public debt after decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing to balance budgets. The government declared the debt unpayable in June 2015, and nearly two years later filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in US history.  The new restructuring plan targets bonds and other debt held by the government and will now go before a federal judge. The percentage of Puerto Rico's taxpayer funds spent on debt payments will fall to less than 9%, compared to almost 30% before the restructuring. It would also cut pensions for retirees who receive more than $1,200 a month.

15,Leading Puerto Rico Newspaper Torches Trump's 'Fake Numbers' On Front Page,Amy Russo,8/31/19,"As President Donald Trump repeatedly levels false claims that Puerto Rico has been granted $92 billion in hurricane recovery aid, the island’s leading newspaper sent him a direct message on its front page Friday: “Your Numbers Are Fake.”El Nuevo Día, which typically publishes in Spanish, released an English version of the paper laying out a fact-check of the president’s math.“Although some politicians in Puerto Rico have indeed mismanaged funds and have let their constituents down, Mr. Trump’s claims about the amount of money that has actually been assigned to the island are incorrect,” it reads.In reality, federal data shows that Congress has allocated $49.7 billion to Puerto Rico’s disaster relief following hurricanes Irma and Maria, both of which struck in 2017. Of that total, less than $14 billion has been received.But Trump has long disregarded the numbers, instead insisting that the island has been paid several times the actual amount.“Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end?” he tweeted Tuesday, erroneously stating once again that Congress has approved $92 billion for the island, calling it “an all time record of its kind for ‘anywhere.’”The president also made the claim in July, days before Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced his resignation amid protests over the leak of his crude messages to advisers and federal corruption charges against two of his administration’s former top officials.In a pair of tweets that month, Trump took the opportunity to attack the island, claiming “Congress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief, much of which was squandered away or wasted, never to be seen again.”On Wednesday, as Puerto Rico was readying itself for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian, which mainly missed the area on its way toward Florida, Trump called the island “one of the most corrupt places on earth” and slammed its politicians as “incompetent.”Though the president has deemed himself “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico,” he is part of the reason it has been slow to receive aid. In June, The Washington Post reported that he had finally signed a disaster relief bill that he had delayed for months in opposition to the funds.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-el-nuevo-dia-donald-trump-recovery-aid_n_5d6a71e7e4b0cdfe0570c804,HuffPost,Liberal
48,"Puerto Rico reopens its schools and airports, largely spared by Dorian","Jason Hanna, Omar Jimenez and Emanuella Grinberg",8/29/19," Hurricane Dorian spared Puerto Rico of its worst winds and rains on Wednesday, as it largely steered clear of the US territory while it  battered the British and Virgin Islands instead . One man died after falling from the roof of his house while cleaning a drain in preparation for the storm, officials said.  But as for the storm itself, Puerto Rico had feared much more fallout. Schools and airports were closed across the territory, but Dorian's path went further east than anticipated. Moderate to heavy showers fell across parts of the US territory -- its sparsely populated island of Culebra generally received the most, with around 5 inches. Some regions received a half-inch to 2 inches of rain. No major damage was reported, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced said. ""I am proud of our Puerto Rican community, because once again they showed discipline, preparation, and respect towards all the orders given to them for their protection,"" she said. By 7 p.m. Wednesday, the peak wind gust recorded in the capital, San Juan, was 34 mph -- well below what was forecast.  TRACK THE STORM Fears that Dorian would  strain Puerto Rico's fragile infrastructure , battered by  2017's deadly Hurricane Maria , were largely unrealized. But with the memory of Maria looming large in the island's psyche, many residents took the threat seriously.

17,"Puerto Rico Braces For Hurricane Dorian, First Major Storm Since 2017’s Maria",Alexander C. Kaufman,8/28/19,"FAJARDO, Puerto Rico ― Dorian, the first hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 2017’s devastating María, was expected to make landfall Wednesday afternoon, pounding the east coast with rain and whipping winds.The storm strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane about 2 p.m. as it barreled over the U.S. Virgin Islands toward Vieques and Culebra, the Puerto Rican islands sometimes called the “colonies of the colony” off the eastern coast.Dorian had been expected to veer south. But early Wednesday morning, the storm turned northward.At a marina in Maternillo, an area in the eastern municipality of Fajardo, boaters rushed to pull vessels from the water as the sky darkened late Wednesday morning. Kenny Garcia, 29, a bank employee from San Lorenzo, said he hadn’t expected the storm to make landfall here.“It’s a surprise,” Garcia said, standing on the dock.Just down the block, Lemuel Otero, 40, hurriedly battened down the roof of his restaurant, El Chinchorro de Tía Manin.“We went to bed thinking the system was going south,” he said. “We woke up this morning to the new reality of the new path.”In the surrounding towns, few homes looked prepared. Windows were open, and few were boarded up. The streets were quiet. The scars of María were still fresh in many places. In the Naguabo neighborhood of Punta Lima, giant wind turbines sat idle, their blades still broken. The bridge that once connected Naguabo with Humacao, where María made landfall, was closed for construction.On the radio, Ada Monzón, the chief meteorologist at WIPR-TV, said Dorian’s winds were at 70 miles per hour as the storm headed straight for Vieques and Culebra. By Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service announced the storm had strengthened to hurricane status near the U.S. Virgin Islands, just to the east of Puerto Rico.The White House, meanwhile, rushed to politicize the storm. In tweets, President Donald Trump declared the territory “one of the most corrupt places on earth” and called himself “the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico.”By the late afternoon, the storm seemed to be dying down. Wielding a giant green umbrella, Aracelys O’Neal walked with three other women along the waterfront in Maternillo, laughing and enjoying the breeze.“Just don’t put us in the paper as the crazy ladies from Fajardo,” she said, joking.Still, some braced for the worst.On the waterfront in Malecón de Naguabo, workers boarded up Vinny’s Restaurant & Pescadería. Hurricane María’s winds smashed the seafood joint’s windows and flipped over trailers as storm surge flooded the floor.“We’re worried things could be destroyed again,” said Alexis Ramos, 30, whose family owns the restaurant.On Tuesday, José Antonio Vázquéz Valdes stood atop a ladder stapling a tarp to a tarp.The original blue sheet of nylon came from the Federal Emergency Management Administration nearly two years ago, after Hurricane María tore the roof off his mother’s small home along the Caño Martin Peña, a badly polluted waterway that runs through one of the capital’s poorest neighborhoods.His mother, 89, died of an infection soon after the storm churned up vile bacteria from the waterway. He inherited the home, and its routine problems. The ceiling is splotched with brown water stains, some of them fresh from a rain shower last Saturday that overflowed the canal and flooded the streets.This week, he bought new blue tarps as Dorian barreled westward across the Caribbean.“I’m stressed,” said Vazquéz, 45, as the sun baked down on Tuesday. “It’s not easy, but you have to move forward.”This story has been updated to note that Dorian has been upgraded to a hurricane and to include additional comments from Puerto Rico residents.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dorian-puerto-rico_n_5d66a6cde4b01fcc690d80c3,HuffPost,Liberal
49,FEMA faces headwinds in Puerto Rico as Dorian hits,Gregory Wallace,8/28/19," As Puerto Rico weathers both Hurricane Dorian and a political storm, it will turn to a federal agency -- the  Federal Emergency Management Agency   -- that is facing upheaval of its own. The spat between President Donald Trump and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz comes while their emergency management teams are dealing with the hurricane, a major effort that requires intensive coordination between local and federal authorities. At the same time, FEMA is in transition.   Even a glancing blow from a low-level hurricane could be damaging to the US territory, where the incomplete recovery from Hurricanes Irma and Maria is symbolized by the homes still covered with blue tarps that were placed in 2017. Another hurricane, Puerto Rican recovery official Omar Marrero told Congress in July, is ""our biggest fear.""   At the federal level, the response is led by a FEMA leadership team that is unsettled. Peter Gaynor, whose experience includes leading disaster preparations and response in Rhode Island, serves as acting administrator while Jeffrey Byard -- Trump's nominee to lead the agency and currently its associate administrator -- is awaiting a Senate confirmation vote.   Adding to the tumult, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday plans to shift $155 million from FEMA's disaster relief fund to immigration priorities -- which, along with FEMA, is a responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.   A FEMA spokeswoman said the agency has sufficient funding and acknowledged the challenges of responding to Dorian ""on top of a complex recovery effort"" from the earlier storms.   ""While repaired systems are in a more resilient condition than they were prior to the 2017 hurricanes, there is still more work to be done,"" the spokeswoman said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. As a result, ""even smaller and less severe storm systems could have a significant impact to infrastructure, individuals, and communities.""  The agency also said the disaster relief funds siphoned off for immigration measures leave ""approximately $27 billion"" still available to respond to disasters including hurricanes. In  late September 2017 , the fund was stocked with about $5 billion, and it was restocked with another $6.7 billion early that October. ""Based on DHS and FEMA's review of historical emergency spending from the DRF Base account, this amount will be sufficient to support operational needs and will not impact ongoing long-term recovery efforts across the country,"" the spokeswoman said.   The House subcommittee chairman overseeing FEMA said that despite the relatively small amount of funds being sent to immigration efforts, he is not confident in FEMA's explanation.   ""These funds are being diverted from FEMA and it's going to naturally impact their ability to respond,"" said Rep. Donald Payne, a New Jersey Democrat.   ""I don't think he realizes what he's doing, putting Americans' lives in danger and not having the resources,"" he said of Trump. In 2017, the situation in Puerto Rico was ""bad enough when they had the resources and were not able to get the job done."" The war of words between Trump and the San Juan mayor that flared up around the 2017 storms  reignited this week , threatening to draw rifts when governmental collaboration is most needed.    Trump said Wednesday that the work of FEMA deserves ""a big Thank You - Not like last time.""   ""That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!"" he said, and also called the island's leadership corrupt.   Yulin Cruz said Trump should ""get out of the way,"" and that thousands of Puerto Ricans had died in the 2017 storms ""because this racist man did not have it within him to do his job.""   Meanwhile, people in Puerto Rico are preparing for a storm that could set back their own return to normalcy.   ""I think the people of Puerto Rico have shown that resiliency is our middle name, our first name and last name,"" resident Mari Rosas told CNN. ""We'll definitely get back up.""

50,Trump slams Puerto Rico as impending storm intensifies,Betsy Klein,8/28/19," President Donald Trump is already picking a fight with  Puerto Rican officials  as a tropical storm barrels toward the island, showing insensitivity to Americans still recovering from one crisis and facing another. ""We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!"" Trump  tweeted  from the White House Wednesday morning.  Later Wednesday, he continued to slam the territory's government and praise himself. ""Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!"" he  wrote , adding, ""And by the way, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico!"" Trump's lack of empathy for Puerto Ricans has been at odds with his treatment of storm victims in the continental US during his tenure in office, prompting criticism of racism, including from some local officials defending their home. Trump and local officials -- namely San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz -- have consistently sparred in the aftermath of 2017's Hurricane Maria over funding, the President's disparaging remarks about the island and more. Tropical storm Dorian is  expected to be near a Category 1 hurricane  as it approaches Puerto Rico Wednesday and could strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in Florida over Labor Day Weekend.  Puerto Ricans are bracing for heavy rains and strong winds nearly two years after the island was hit by Hurricane Maria. Nearly 3,000 people died as a result of the storm and aftereffects, including widespread power outages. Trump has consistently denied any fault for his administration in the aftermath of the storm. In fact, the President has instead  sought praise  for his handling of Hurricane Maria, calling it ""an incredible, unsung success"" last year.  Yulín Cruz criticized Trump on Tuesday as her city prepared for another storm, telling the President to ""get out of the way."" ""It seems like some people have learned the lessons of the past or are willing to say that they didn't do right by us the first time and they are trying to do their best. That is not the case with the President of the United States. We are not going to be concerned by, frankly, his behavior, his lack of understanding, and it is ludicrous,"" she told CNN.  ""Three thousand Puerto Ricans did not open their eyes this morning because this racist man did not have it within him to do his job. So get out of the way, President Trump, and let the people who can do the job get the job done,"" Yulín Cruz said. Trump declared a national emergency and ordered federal assistance to Puerto Rico on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, he tweeted his surprise that ""another"" storm was headed to the island and cited misleading aid numbers.  ""Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for 'anywhere,'"" he  wrote .  But more than half of that $92 billion is based on the White House's estimates for costs FEMA could incur in years to come. $42.7 billion of relief has been appropriated by Congress, with $20.8 billion obligated to be spent by the federal government, and $13.8 billion actually spent, according to the federal government's disaster relief  website .

51,"Puerto Rico was spared the brunt of Dorian, but a 'powerful hurricane' threatens mainland US","Madeline Holcombe, Jason Hanna, Omar Jimenez and Emanuella Grinberg",8/28/19," Puerto Rico was spared the brunt of hurricane-force winds from Dorian that tore through the British and US Virgin Islands Wednesday, flooding roads and leaving areas without power.   But the threat is far from over for the mainland, with Dorian forecast to strengthen into a ""powerful hurricane"" as it heads toward  Florida and other parts of the east coast . As of 8 p.m. ET, the eye of Hurricane Dorian was located roughly 50 miles northeast of San Juan with hurricane-force winds extending 15 miles from the center of the storm, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said.  Wind gusts of up to 40 mph are possible over the next couple of hours, considerably lower than what was forecast, Hennen said. ""Some lingering showers are possible over Puerto Rico, but the strong bands are now pulling away from the Island into the Atlantic, where based on satellite and radar images, Dorian may be intensifying,"" he said. TRACK THE STORM With hurricane advisories discontinued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, attention now shifts to potential impacts to the mainland, he said.  Dorian is expected to gather strength in the next few days over the Atlantic and become a major Category-3 storm or higher. The latest guidance shows Florida as the most likely target, ""and Dorian will likely be a very formidable hurricane as it approaches late Sunday into Monday morning,"" Hennen said. US Virgin Islands under curfew The worst of the storm hit the British and US Virgin Islands, where Dorian toppled trees and power lines, leading local authorities to declare a state of emergency.  On the US Virgin Island of St. Croix, Stacy Mooney was recording video of the heavy rain outside and captured a sudden flash of blue-green light in the distance. Power went out for a few minutes, she wrote on Facebook. ""Overall, things are fine,"" she told CNN. ""The winds have been fierce."" About 25,000 power outages in St. Croix were restored around 7 p.m. local time, Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority Director of Communications Jean Greaux told CNN.  ""Within an hour of its passage, The Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority mobilized crews to conduct a damage assessment. We immediately commenced restoration of service. Crews are now dispersed addressing isolated or pocket outages in a few locations,"" Greaux said.    Restoration processes began around 4 p.m. local time in the St. Thomas and St. John districts, Greaux said. By Wednesday night, power on St. John was restored and work continues in St. Thomas with a significant portion already re-energized.  Greaux said work will continue through the night.  Puerto Rico prepared for impact One man died after falling from the roof of his house while cleaning a drain in preparation for the storm, Puerto Rico Public safety Secretary Elmer Roman said.  Otherwise, fears that Dorian would  strain Puerto Rico's fragile infrastructure  were largely unrealized. But with the memory of Hurricane Maria looming large in the island's psyche, many residents took the threat seriously.  ""Thankfully, I've been preparing since May,"" said Krystle Rivera, whose family has been stocking up on water, canned food and gas in anticipation of the hurricane season. Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced on Monday declared a state of emergency for the island and urged people to prepare for the storm. Schools across Puerto Rico were closed Wednesday. In the city of Ponce on Puerto Rico's southern coast, people still have tarps over their homes from Maria's damage, Mayor Maria ""Mayita"" Melendez told CNN.  Myers feared that Dorian's rains could easily worsen already delicate conditions. ""There's already so much damage on the ground from (Maria) that this isn't going to take a lot to make a significant amount of damage, especially flooding,"" he said.

16,Trump Trashed Puerto Rico On Twitter As Island Braced For Hurricane Dorian,Josephine Harvey,8/28/19,"While Puerto Ricans were bracing for the intensifying Hurricane Dorian, their president was firing off tweets about corruption on the island and bragging about being the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico.On Wednesday, locals scrambled to prepare for the storm barreling toward their coastline, bringing damaging winds, torrential rain, flash flooding, storm surge and mudslides. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump came to the rescue with a string of unhelpful tweets, demonstrating a complete lack of sensitivity toward American citizens facing and still recovering from a crisis.“And by the way,” he added, “I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico!”When Puerto Rico was last hit by a major storm, the Category 4 Hurricane Maria in 2017, nearly 3,000 people died from the disaster before, during and afterward.The president absolved himself of blame and denied the accuracy of the numbers, tweeting that “3,000 people did not die” and that when he’d left the island after the storm, “they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths.” (The previous official death toll of 64 was revised to 2,975 in 2018 after research found that thousands had died due to the hurricane’s aftereffects.) According to CNN, Trump also praised his handling of the hurricane as an “incredible, unsung success.”Dorian hit less than a month before the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, from which many Puerto Ricans are still recovering. While FEMA and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz were working together to coordinate assistance, Cruz denounced the president’s tweets.“I said yesterday that Trump needs to be [quiet], ‘calm down’ get out of the way and make way for those of us who are actually doing the work on the ground,” she tweeted. “Maybe Trump will understand this time around THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIM; THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS; THIS IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES.”On Tuesday, Trump approved an emergency declaration for Hurricane Dorian, according to a White House statement, ordering federal assistance to aid local response efforts in Puerto Rico. High winds and intense rain lashed Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands Wednesday afternoon when the storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. Much of Puerto Rico’s main island was spared the worst of it.So far, there is one known death in connection to the hurricane. An 80-year-old man fell from a ladder while preparing his home for the storm, NBC reported.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) declared a state of emergency on Wednesday afternoon for Florida residents, warning that Dorian was expected to be a major hurricane by the time it makes landfall there. The storm is predicted to thrash the southeastern U.S. over Labor Day weekend and may intensify to Category 3.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-hurricane-dorian-tweets_n_5d6705a2e4b01fcc690e84bf,HuffPost,Liberal
52,Puerto Rico swears in third governor in less than a week,Ray Sanchez,8/7/19," Puerto Rico's  Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez Garced  was sworn in Wednesday afternoon as the third governor that the financially and politically troubled island has had in less than a week.  Hours earlier, the highest court declared unconstitutional the governorship of disgraced former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's handpicked successor, a move certain to prolong the political crisis on the US territory.   The unanimous decision by the Supreme Court threw out last week's swearing in of attorney Pedro Pierluisi on grounds he had not been confirmed as secretary of state by both chambers of the legislature.    Pierluisi, in a statement shortly   before Vázquez took the oath, announced that his short-lived tenure had come to an end after just five days.  ""In light of the decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, I must step aside and support the Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico,"" he said.  Pierluisi added, ""This is a time when we must all unite for Puerto Rico, leaving behind any partisan, ideological or personal agendas. In other words, this is a time for unity of purpose for the benefit of Puerto Rico, until our people have the opportunity to choose their future leaders in next year's elections."" Moments after his statement, the governor's office tweeted a photo of Vázquez taking the oath of office.  Pierluisi had been expected to replace the disgraced Rosselló, who stepped down as governor following weeks of protests. Rosselló named him Puerto Rico's secretary of state, placing him next in line to become governor. But a legal challenge by Senate president Thomas Rivera Schatz, a Rosselló rival who himself has sights on the governorship, had asked island's highest court to intervene. ""To those who lent themselves, for their personal interest, to this embarrassing attempt to install an illegitimate government, that is how you will go down in the history of Puerto Rico,"" Rivera Schatz said in a statement posted on Facebook after the ruling.  Infighting within the New Progressive Party Vázquez said Wednesday that she respected the ruling and would assume the governorship.  ""Puerto Rico needs certainty and stability,"" she said in the statement released via Twitter.  Observers said the latest development plunged the island into political and economic purgatory. Some pundits even suggested that Vázquez will take the oath only to name a new secretary of state who would then take over as governor.  ""It's almost a joke,"" said longtime political expert Mario Negron Portillio.  ""In a matter of a couple of weeks Puerto Rico has had three governors. Nobody knows what time it is. Honest to God. The economy is standing still because nobody knows what's going to happen. Who wants to invest ... in Puerto Rico if you don't even know who's going to be governor next week? This is a crazy house right now."" The affair highlights the fierce infighting within Rosselló's pro-statehood New Progressive Party and threatens to deepen the political turmoil on the island, where protesters have voiced opposition to both Vázquez and Pierluisi.   Pierluisi, 60, is a corporate lawyer for the O'Neill & Borges law firm in San Juan. His firm represents the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico -- which Congress created in 2016 to help manage territory's financial crisis. His brother-in-law is the head of the board, known as la Junta on the island and a target of protesters who helped topple the unpopular Rosselló.  One of the more popular chants among protesters prior to Rosselló's resignation was ""Ricky renuncia y llévate a la Junta"" (Ricky resign and take the Junta with you.) Pierluisi is also the former resident commissioner, the island's sole non-voting representative in Congress, from 2009-2017. He also served as Puerto Rico's secretary of justice under former Gov. Pedro Rosselló, the current governor's father. Vázquez isn't much more popular and even  took to Twitter recently to say she didn't want the governorship.  She became secretary of justice in January 2017, and is an ally of Rosselló.  Critics cite Vázquez's close ties to the outgoing governor as well as her own controversies and limited political experience. They accuse her of failing to open investigations against members of her own party, particularly Rosselló and his administration's handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Last year, Vazquez came under fire for allegedly intervening on behalf of her daughter in a case stemming from a home theft. She faced charges of violating government ethics laws. But a judge later ruled there was insufficient evidence to arrest her. Controversial text messages started the uproar Rosselló stepped down on Friday following weeks of massive anti-government protests.  Protests were sparked by the release of private chat messages that exposed Rosselló and 11 top aides and Cabinet members exchanging profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages about fellow politicians, members of the media, celebrities and others. The texting scandal followed years of alleged corruption, a debt crisis and widespread devastation by Hurricane Maria. The leaks and the unrest that followed rocked the island's administration and led to resignations of several high-profile political figures.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/us/puerto-rico-new-governor-court-decision/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiiy7as5Mj6AhUUmYQIHZABB0Y4tAEQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw3rZpUuj6JK9-47wKbUq-Gc,CNN,Liberal
18,Puerto Rico’s New Governor Lobbied For Coal Utility Accused Of Poisoning Groundwater,Alexander C. Kaufman,8/4/19,"Puerto Rico’snewly sworn-in Gov. Pedro Pierluisi is a veteran politician who represented the territory as its delegate in Congress and served as justice secretary. In between, he worked as a corporate lawyer at O’Neill & Borges in San Juan, where he represented AES Corporation, the coal-fired utility giant accused of polluting groundwater with toxic ash, and the unelected eight-person Financial Oversight and Management Board imposing painful austerity cuts on the island. Now, if he survives a Senate confirmation vote this week, Pierluisi will oversee the previous administration’s effort to sell off the island’s publicly-owned utility to private companies at the board’s behest. “This is an outrage,” said Ruth Santiago, a lawyer and community activist in Salinas, one of the cities on Puerto Rico’s south coast that AES’s coal ash pile polluted. Former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who quit amid scandal as half-a-million Puerto Ricans filled the streets demanding his resignation, appointed Pierluisi as his new secretary of state shortly before stepping down Friday. Under the territory’s rules of succession, Pierluisi, 60, became the new governor, though the validity of his oath of office is now facingmultiple legal challenges. Already, demonstrators are calling for his ouster, and, though not legally obligated, he agreed to step aside if the island’s Senate opposes his confirmation in a vote expected this week. His ruling New Progressive Party controls the legislature, but it’s unclear whether Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, arival to replace Rosselló, may rally votes against Pierluisi.A spokesman for the governor’s office did not return a request for comment on Saturday. Even if Pierluisi is confirmed, his term expires after next year’s gubernatorial election. Protesters on the island could try to cast him out sooner. The self-declared revolution on San Juan’s streets came in response to leaked chat logs that showed Rosselló and top Cabinet officials made misogynistic, homophobic remarks and cracked jokes about the bodies of those killed in 2017’s Hurricane María. But the roots of the unrest go back over a decade. The United States, which conquered Puerto Rico in 1898, industrialized the island in the mid-20th century in large part with tax breaks to mainland firms. In 1996, then-President Bill Clinton phased out the exemptions but for those on municipal debt. As companies left, jobs plummeted and the tax base shrunk, successive Puerto Rican governments issued billions in debt to pay for schools, roads and police.By 2006, the island fell into recession and faced a budget crisis. So-called vulture funds, Wall Street firms that buy distressed debt on the cheap and aggressively demand repayment, swooped in as Puerto Rico’s creditors. As a territory, Puerto Rico could not declare bankruptcy the way a mainland municipality like Detroit could. Instead, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act in 2016 that put in place an unelected Financial Oversight and Management Board. Known locally by the pejorative “La Junta,” the board, given imperial reign over Puerto Rico’s public spending, instituted austerity cuts, slashing retirees’ pensions and closing hundreds of schools. The devastating 2017 hurricane season ― which left more than 3,000 dead, mostly from lack of access to medicine, clean water and housing ― inflamed Puerto Ricans’ suffering. Rosselló’s inflammatory text messages, coupled with mounting evidence of corruption in his administration, served only as the proverbial match that lit a tinderbox. Compared to his predecessor, Pierluisi is an even easier avatar for the widely despised oversight board, whose members include, as The Intercept noted, Andrew Biggs — a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former George W. Bush administration official who pushed to privatize Social Security ― and Carlos García, who helped engineer the debt crisis as chief executive of Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank. The board’s chairman is José Carrión III, an insurance executive and Pierluisi’s brother-in-law. To boot, Pierluisi’s former law firm worked for the board.“Pierluisi is highly problematic,” said Julio López Varona, a San Juan-based lawyer who works with the Center for Popular Democracy, a think tank. “All of this signals that he would support more privatization and that the current debt deals being negotiated would potentially favor vultures.”The new governor, he said, “could potentially be worse than Rosselló,” who had been pushing back against his financial overseers to soften the blow to public services and pensions ahead of his planned reelection campaign next year. But the oversight board’s push to sell off Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the debt-strangled public power company, is moving ahead. Puerto Ricans already pay roughly twice the national average for electricity. Under the privatization plan that Rosselló released, electricity rates will increase 18% to 27 cents per kilowatt-hour in five years and continue to rise, according to an Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis calculation from February. Pierluisi’s ties to AES are likely to amplify opposition to his government. The Virginia-based company runs Puerto Rico’s only coal-fired power station, and one of its few privately-operated plants, in Guayama. The municipality, with a population of roughly 45,000, already suffered higher than average cancer rates. Between 2004 and 2014, Guayama ranked among the 10 municipalities with the highest incidence of cancer on the island, according to data from the Puerto Rico Cancer Registry that the watchdog Centro de Periodismo Investigativo cited. The neighboring towns of Santa Isabel, Arroyo and Salinas each fell in third, fourth and fifth place on the list.In an investigation the watchdog site published last year, locals and four experts accused AES’ coal ash pile of “releasing large quantities of chemicals into the groundwater.” The company’s own reports concluded its coal ash piles had “no impact on drinking water” and found “no evidence of impact to human health or the environment.”But the link between coal ash and water contamination is only beginning to emerge. A study published last year by the North Carolina Institute of Medicine found that more research is needed to determine the cumulative impacts of long-term exposure to coal ash. Some heavy metals and chemicals found in coal ash “can cause cancer after continued long-term ingestion and inhalation,” according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. In March, the first national study to examine groundwater monitoring data near coal-fired plants found 242 of the 265 plants with monitoring data contained unsafe levels of one or more pollutants found in coal ash. Before 2017’s storms, the Puerto Rican Board of Environmental Quality ordered AES to secure its hulking black mounds of coal ash with covers and lining. It didn’t. Instead, the hurricanes blew the ash into the air as rains washed it into groundwater, where heavy metals and radioactive materials spread, according to an investigation by the island’s newspaper of record El Nuevo Día. A study AES released last year confirmed the contamination. Since then, AES started shipping the coal ash elsewhere, including 650 million pounds sent to Florida’s Osceola County, where, in a cruel twist, thousands of Puerto Ricans displaced by the storm now live. Rosselló had vowed in April to halt coal use on the island next year. It’s unclear whether Pierluisi will fulfill that promise. At a hearing in Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives on Friday, Pierluisi defended his work for AES and argued that coal ash and a construction product made from it called Agremax are, in fact, safe. He admitted to pressuring Puerto Rico Rep. María Milagros Charbonier to vote against a bill that would have put limits on the use of Agremax, which is made from mixing water and ash. Pierluisi said he was only lobbying for his client. But Charbonier accused him of heavy-handed tactics.“You called me to tell me that the project was unconstitutional,” Charbonier said, according to El Nuevo Día.If AES continues to burn coal, replenishing the existing piles on the island, it could face even less accountability for its pollution. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed loosening rules on coal ash, scrapping a blanket rule that requires utilities to prove piles of at least 12,400 tons are safe. The move comes a year after AES’s Puerto Rico subsidiary petitioned the EPA to weaken regulations on groundwater monitoring around coal ash deposits and raise the limits on lead, cobalt, lithium and other metals in aquifers. The petition is still pending.Judith Enck, Puerto Rico’s former EPA regional administrator, said the AES plant is a “major problem on the island.” She urged Pierluisi to halt any further coal- or biomass-burning at the AES plant. “Pierluisi should, at the very least, recuse himself from any decisions involving AES,” Enck said by email Saturday.

53,The downfall of Puerto Rico's once powerful Rosselló political dynasty,Ray Sanchez,8/3/19," Nearly a decade before  Puerto Rico 's disgraced Gov. Ricardo Rosselló ran for office, the ambitious and telegenic young man and his closest friends made no secret of his aspirations to move back to the palatial governor's mansion where he grew up as the scion of money and privilege. ""Ricky's friends regularly joked about the positions they would hold in his future administration,"" said Yosem Companys, a onetime mentor to Rosselló. ""All he ever really wanted to do was become governor."" No matter who replaces Rosselló until the end of his term in January 2021, the collapse of his once-promising career in politics -- following in the footsteps of his father, Pedro, the former governor -- will leave an indelible stain on the legacy of one of the island's most powerful political dynasties.  ""He is going to be the most disgraced governor in the history of Puerto Rico,"" Companys said of the younger Rosselló. ""And he's basically dragged his father down with him. The name will now be persona non grata in Puerto Rico.""    Rosselló's press office did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.  Hurricane Maria may have set downfall in motion  The embattled Rosselló, 40,  stepped down Friday afternoon  after weeks of protests but the island's Senate confirmation of his next secretary of state and eventual successor, Pedro Pierluisi, is mired in uncertainty, intraparty feuding and a possible court fight.  Still, Pierluisi was sworn in as Rosselló's likely successor on Friday, with the Senate set to vote on the appointment next week.  The political firestorm that preceded  Rosselló's historic resignation  saw its embers in a series of scandals that included the recent disclosure of  crude, sexist and homophobic chat messages  between the governor and members of his inner circle.   Last month, days before the leaked chats, FBI agents arrested two ranking Rosselló officials, accusing them of directing contracts worth millions to politically-connected firms. For many, the moment harkened to the scandals that plagued the second term of his father, Pedro Rosselló, a Yale-educated and Harvard-trained doctor who served as governor in the 1990s. Indeed, long before Puerto Ricans took to the streets for nearly two weeks in July to demand that Rosselló step down, generations had lived through monumental levels of corruption and mismanagement at the hands of a disconnected political class.  A prolonged economic recession and Puerto Rico's debt crisis in recent years resulted in shuttered schools, cuts in government service, layoffs and university tuition hikes. Three years ago, the US Congress created a board to oversee the US territory's finances -- a body that also drew the ire of the anti-Rosselló protesters. But the eventual downfall of his administration may have been set in motion by Hurricane Maria in 2017. The devastating storm made landfall less than nine months after Rosselló returned as governor to the 16th-century mansion known as La Fortaleza. ""The hurricane put him in a situation where he was definitely in over his head,"" said Companys, a Half Moon Bay, California, resident and president of the Silicon Valley firm Techlantis.  Chats reveal arrogance and insolence of the political elite Hurricane Maria  decimated the island's antiquated power grid. Many residents were left in the dark for months. The administration ignored advice from attorneys before i nking a controversial $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy , a small Montana-based firm that only employed two people at the time Maria hit. There were widespread problems with the distribution of food , water and other vital supplies to those who needed it most. And it wasn't until nearly a year after the storm that the  Rosselló administration finally admitted that the storm left several thousand people dead  -- not the dozens that had been the official line.   ""It was evident after Maria that Rosselló didn't know what he was doing,"" said Mario Negron Portillo, a political expert and retired University of Puerto Rico professor. ""Everything went downhill after Maria."" Still, the chats that surfaced a year and half after the storm -- an affair dubbed ""Rickyleaks"" -- proved his final undoing. For a huge swath of the populace -- a cross-section of various generations and people of different political stripes -- the messages exposed the arrogance and insolence of a political elite long divorced from the struggles of ordinary people.   In the chats, Rosselló and his inner circle offended nearly every one of the island's 3 million residents. They took aim at women, gay people, overweight people, a revered independence movement leader who died of cancer, and the thousands of hurricane victims. ""There were a lot of jokes over the years about Ricardo Rosselló being this entitled kid who had all the privileges and never had to work or face any consequences for anything,"" said Mayra Velez Serrano, a professor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras. ""The chats basically confirmed that. He was still very immature. He still talked like he didn't realize the responsibility he had."" Pedro Rosselló discouraged son from pursuing politics, former mentor says Rosselló's first foray into politics came in the early 2000s. Companys, who was an adviser on Latino issues for the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark, would become his mentor. Pedro Rosselló had done the same for a younger Companys, who now got the younger Rosselló campaign work in Arizona.  ""His job was basically licking envelopes,"" Companys recalled. ""I told Pedro, 'Look, I'm going to put him to lick envelopes. He said, 'Good. He needs to learn responsibility.'"" Companys remembered a phone call in which Pedro Rosselló said he had encouraged the youngest of his three sons to stay out of politics.  ""Pedro had really soured on politics,"" he said. ""He would always say, 'I don't want my son in politics because it's a dirty business. I don't want him to get hurt.'"" Pedro Rosselló did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Over the years, the younger Rosselló worked on two unsuccessful bids at the island's top office by his father, who had already governed from 1993 to 2000. At the time of his first marriage outside of Detroit in 2008, Rosselló and his friends talked about the governorship and the positions they would hold as members of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, according to Companys.  ""He tended to be surrounded by 'yes' people and if anybody criticized him, he would kick them out of his circle,"" Companys recalled. ""He started liking the fact that people tried to ingratiate themselves with him because they found him to be important."" Like his father in his prime, Rosselló sought to ride his boyish good looks and academic credentials to La Fortaleza. He played tennis like his dad, a former tennis champion on the island. He graduated from MIT with degrees in biomedical engineering and economics before earning a doctorate at the University of Michigan.  ""Ricardo was able to take advantage of his last name,"" Negron Portillo said. ""People still remembered his father fondly.""  Still, the elder Rosselló, at least initially, was apprehensive about his son's political ambitions, according to Companys.  ""The way that his parents described it ... was that he was the most brilliant person in the family but he was an absent-minded professor like Dr. Emmett Brown in 'Back to the Future,'"" he said. Rosselló downplayed his lack of political and work experience, Companys said.  ""He would say, 'I really don't think I need it. I think I can get elected without it,"" Companys recalled.    Rosselló ran for governor in 2016. He took office in January 2017 alongside a tight circle of loyal advisers who, like him, possessed little or no political experience, according to Negron Portillo, Campanys and others. ""Ricardo and his friends may have let the boat come down,"" said Alvaro Cifuentes, who was part of Pedro Rosselló's cabinet during his first term. ""I mean, you need to have a fortitude of historic proportion when you're the leader of any state or any nation. It should not be taken lightly."" His father's administration credited for big projects but plagued by corruption   Pedro Rosselló, 75, burst into electoral politics in the early 1990s. He was a longtime pediatric surgeon and, like the son who would follow his footsteps decades later, a relative political novice.  But he had wide appeal among pro-statehood, commonwealth and independence supporters -- with promises to combat crime, improve education, increase health services and slash taxes.  ""I didn't know Pedro before"" the campaign, said Cifuentes, who at the time was a managing partner in a law firm on the island. ""He was recommended to me as a pediatric surgeon because my son needed a small surgery. I was enchanted by the demeanor and the care that he had toward my young son. How he gave us so much comfort."" Cifuentes became his campaign manager. The morning after the election, Rosselló offered him the post of secretary of government.  ""I said, 'Pedro, what's that?'"" Cifuentes recalled. ""And his answer was, 'I don't know but it has to be my alter ego and someone that I can trust.'"" The elder Rosselló would become the architect of large-scale projects like an urban metro rail system, a convention center complex and a sprawling coliseum that would eventually saddle the island in debt.  ""We had a saying, 'We don't talk. We walk,'"" Cifuentes said. ""We were very good at implementing. And that all came from Pedro Rosselló, the doctor."" Rosselló dispatched the National Guard to crime-ridden housing projects. He slashed the bloated government workforce. He offered private health insurance to the poor. But his second term was marked by corruption scandals involving dozens of ranking members of his administration and party, including his top personal assistant, a former education secretary and a former House speaker.  In the summer of 2000, a federal prosecutor was quoted as saying, ""In Puerto Rico, corruption has a first and last name -- the New Progressive Party.""  ""On one hand, Pedro Rosselló was remembered for the big projects and the good economy under his leadership and, on the other hand, people remember him because of the corruption of the times,"" Negron Portillo said.  Pedro Rosselló was never charged or accused of any crimes. Over the years, he and supporters said the prosecutions were an attempt by political opponents to discredit the pro-statehood movement.  Cifuentes said the scandals were the work of ""the usual suspects"" who have long infected island politics with patronage and cronyism.    Pedro Rosselló, who served as governor until the end of 2000, was defeated when he tried to return to the governor's seat in 2004.  His son, Ricardo, isolated in La Fortaleza after the resignations of many of his top aides and facing increasing protests and clashes in the streets, announced on July 24 that would step down.  ""Pedro Rosselló, as an elected official from day one, never lived by the mantra of being a legend in his own mind,"" Cifuentes said. ""But over the past two and half years, when you have a government where individuals believe they're legends in their own minds, that always spells trouble.""",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/us/puerto-rico-rossello-father-son-legacy/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjikvij2sj6AhVAmIQIHfS9BHI4RhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw2HFVAh9Ju9SmvN6fxmBkLF,CNN,Liberal
54,Puerto Rico's potential next governor doesn't want the job but she says it's her duty,Nicole Chavez,8/1/19," After  Puerto Rico  legislators delayed a vote to confirm Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's  possible successor  on Thursday, the woman who is currently next in line for the job said she won't resign and would follow the rule of law. ""If the time comes, we'll assume the responsibility imposed by the Constitution and the law,"" Puerto Rico's Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez Garced  tweeted Thursday.  A day before Rosselló's  announced resignation  is set to take effect, it's still unclear who will become the next governor of the US territory. The outgoing governor had nominated attorney  Pedro Pierluisi  as secretary of state, paving the way for him to become the next governor.  But when legislators met on Thursday for a special session to discuss Pierluisi's nomination, they decided to postpone their final vote until next week.  If a new secretary of state is not confirmed before the governor leaves office, the next in line, Vázquez Garced, would likely become the next governor, according to Puerto Rico's law. Vázquez Garced said Thursday that she is not thinking about resigning. Earlier this week, she said  she didn't want the job .  Senators will vote to confirm Pierluisi until next week  Power struggles have intensified within Rosselló's pro-statehood New Progressive Party earlier this week and they became apparent on Thursday.  During the Senate's special session on Thursday, Thomas Rivera Schatz, the powerful president of the Senate and expected new head of the party, criticized Pierluisi but said he would have a chance to defend himself in a confirmation hearing. The governor's party had been pushing for Rivera Schatz, one of Rosselló's longtime political rivals, to be named secretary of state.  Senate members postponed their vote to confirm Pierluisi as secretary of state. The House is expected to meet Friday to discuss his nomination. While some people favor Pierluisi for his ties to Capitol Hill, many seem him as a problematic figure. ""For a long time Pierluisi had a good name in Puerto Rico. He was seen as a good guy, a consensus builder. But when he was the resident commissioner for Puerto Rico he asked for the oversight board. And now he's an attorney for the oversight board,"" said political expert Mario Negron Portillo. But in the wake of a political crisis in Puerto Rico, Rosselló could have not had many candidates to choose from.  ""The New Progressive party doesn't have a good option to support because all the people they had who could take that role in the government have been tainted by scandal,"" said Jorell A. Melendez-Badillo, an assistant professor of Latin American and Caribbean history at Dartmouth College. Who is Pedro Pierluisi? Pierluisi, 60, is a corporate lawyer for the O'Neill & Borges law firm in San Juan. His firm represents the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico -- which Congress created in 2016 to help manage territory's financial crisis. His brother-in-law is the head of the board, known as la Junta on the island. One of the more popular chants among protesters prior to Rosselló's resignation was ""Ricky renuncia y llévate a la Junta"" (Ricky resign and take the Junta with you.) He took a leave of absence effective Tuesday, according to the firm's website. Pierluisi is also the former Puerto Rico's resident commissioner, the island's sole representative in Congress, from 2009-2017. He also previously served as Puerto Rico's secretary of justice under former Gov. Pedro Rosselló, the current governor's father. Rosselló defeated Pierluisi in 2016 when they sought the New Progressive Party nomination for governor. After his loss, Pierluisi moved to the private sector. In his statement announcing the nomination, Rosselló said Pierluisi's previous positions make him an ideal candidate to confront the current political challenges. ""This historic time requires a person able to re-establish relations with all sectors at the local and national level,"" said the outgoing governor. Pierluisi said in a statement Wednesday that he believes it is crucial to recover the trust of federal authorities, US Congress and continue rebuilding Puerto Rico.  ""I have listened to the people's messages, their demonstrations, their demands and their concerns,"" Pierluisi said in a statement. ""And in this new challenge in my life, I will only answer to the people. My goal is now to transform the energy shown by our people in constructive actions that help Puerto Rico go forward."" Rosselló has said Pierluisi will finish out his term but will not seek the governorship next year. Text scandal led to governor's ouster Following days of  massive anti-government protests , Rosselló announced last week that he will resign.  Protests were sparked by the release of  private chat messages that exposed Rosselló and 11 top aides  and Cabinet members exchanging profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages about fellow politicians, members of the media, celebrities and others. The texting scandal followed years of alleged corruption, a debt crisis and widespread devastation by Hurricane Maria. The leaks and the unrest that followed rocked the island's administration and led to resignations of several high-profile political figures. According to Puerto Rico's order of succession, the secretary of state is next in line after the governor. The man who held that position, Luis G. Rivera Marín, resigned July 13 because he  was a participant in a group chat  at the heart of the scandal.

55,"Private leaked texts, massive protests and a governor's downfall: A timeline of Puerto Rico's political unrest",Nicole Chavez,7/28/19," Hundreds of thousands of  people took the streets  of  Puerto Rico  to bring down  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló.   A texting scandal involving Rosselló sparked nearly two weeks of massive anti-government protests in the US territory after years of alleged corruption, a debt crisis and Hurricane Maria. Here are the events that led to his resignation: First leaked messages are published July 10 Two former Puerto Rico officials, the island's education secretary and the head of the health insurance administration, were arrested on corruption charges. They were accused of   directing millions of dollars in government contracts to politically connected contractors. July 11 After the arrests, the governor returned home from a previously scheduled family vacation outside the US territory and a few messages from a private Telegram chat with his inner circle were leaked.  He apologized for referring to a former New York official with an expletive in those messages. ""I want to apologize for the expressions that I wrote in a private chat,""  Rosselló told reporters.  ""I'm the governor of Puerto Rico but I'm also a human being with my failures and my virtues."" More leaked chats fuel unrest July 13 The Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism published  nearly 900 pages of derisive and offensive private chat messages  between Rosselló and members of his inner circle. The exchanges from the messaging app Telegram ridiculed numerous politicians, journalists and celebrities in a scandal many called ""RickyLeaks,"" after the governor's nickname. The messages were sent in December 2018 and January 2019. Two Cabinet members who were part of the chats, Puerto Rico's former chief fiscal officer Sobrino Vega and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin, resigned. July 14 Protests began to grow outside Rosselló's official residence, known as La Fortaleza, following the release of the leaked texts. The protesters called for Rosselló to resign. July 15 Police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters calling for his ouster.  Governor apologizes but won't resign July 16 Rosselló announced  he would not step down . In a news conference, he also defended the actions of police and accused protestors of unleashing tear gas and setting fires during demonstrations the night before.  ""I will continue my work and my responsibility to the people of Puerto Rico,"" the governor told reporters. Celebrities join protests July 17 Puerto Rico's Justice Department issued summonses for everyone involved in the private chat group with Rosselló. Latin trap artist Bad Bunny  left his European tour and joined protests in San Juan. Ricky Martin, rappers Residente and iLe also marched with hundreds of people from Puerto Rico's Capitol building to the governor's mansion. Bad Bunny, Residente and iLe released a protest anthem,  ""Afilando los Cuchillos""  (""Sharpening The Knives"") on YouTube.  ""Hamilton"" creator  Lin-Manuel Miranda , who also is mentioned in the chats, attends a parallel protest in New York City.  Once again, officers used tear gas to push protesters back during an intense standoff in front of the governor's mansion. Governor asks for forgiveness  July 18 Rosselló tweeted a statement saying he respects the people's right to protest and their actions have ""not gone unnoticed."" He also asked the Puerto Rican people for forgiveness. July 19 The president of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives, Carlos ""Johnny"" Méndez,  created a special committee  to advise him on whether the governor committed impeachable offenses based on the leaked messages. July 21 Rosselló announced he will not run for re-election in 2020 and resigned from his role as president of the New Progressive Party. ""A huge portion of the population is unhappy and I recognize it,"" Rosselló said on Facebook Live. ""I've heard you, I love the island and people. ... Today I have the responsibility to direct my strengths to try to find alternatives so that with God we may be able to move forward."" Unrest intensifies July 22 Hundreds of thousands of people  shut down a major highway in San Juan  and and launched an island-wide strike demanding Rosselló's resignation.  Protests were ongoing for about a week but demonstrators said they were not going to rest until Rosselló left office. They spanned many generations and political leanings. They said they were not backing up because they've endured political corruption, high poverty rates, crushing debt and a painful recovery since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017. July 23 Rosselló's chief of staff submitted his resignation, effective July 31, according to a letter obtained by CNN.  Reports saying the governor was planning  to resign by the following day started circulating. July 24 An energetic crowd awaiting the governor's anticipated announcement filled the streets outside the governor's mansion waving flags and banners throughout the day. Near midnight, Rosselló announced his resignation -- effective August 2 --  in a recorded message posted on social media. The governor is two and a half years into his four-year term. July 28  Puerto Rico's Secretary of Justice Wanda Vázquez Garced  said on Twitter she does not want to be the US territory's next governor.  ""I have no interest in occupying the position of Governor,"" Vázquez  said on Twitter . According to Puerto Rico's order of succession, the secretary of state should be next in line after the governor. But the man holding that position, Luis G. Rivera Marín resigned July 13.  As a result, Vázquez was next in line.

56,The faces and voices that toppled Puerto Rico's governor,Mohammed Elshamy and Ray Sanchez,7/27/19," The tropical heat and the downpours. The blasts of tear gas and pepper spray. What they endured during weeks of protests against  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló  was nothing, they said, compared to what came before. Across the island, Puerto Ricans took to the streets following years of corruption and mismanagement at the hands of government leaders. First-time marchers stood with retired teachers and government workers, union members and longtime political activists, pro-statehood residents and supporters of independence.   They waved flags and handscrawled signs. They banged drums and pots and pans. They spoke out against suffocating debt, school closings and public service cuts. They denounced the Rosselló administration's botched response to Hurricane Maria in 2017, especially its longtime failure to acknowledge a death toll of more than 4,000 people. They rallied against what they consider to be the second-class citizenship afforded to a US territory where about 40% of its more than 3 million residents live in poverty. The  chat app scandal that exposed Rosselló and 11 top aides and Cabinet members  exchanging profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages about fellow politicians, members of the media, celebrities and others was merely the final indignity. Late Wednesday,  Rosselló conceded he could no longer credibly govern  and said he would step down by Friday.  These faces and voices helped bring down a governor:  Zuheidy Ramos, 21  Ramos summarizes her presence at the protests in one word: indignation.  ""They are our employees, they are the people's employees,"" she says of the island's politicians.  ""And they can't do whatever they want with us. We put them there to represent us and they are doing us harm."" Kiromy Arroyo, 19 ""I am disgusted by all the injustice -- in education, the soaring prices, the treatment of the dead,"" she says. ""I feel some relief but there are others left that have to be removed (from government)."" Melania Ruiz, 76  ""This is my first time protesting. It makes me sad because I was one of the people who voted for (Rosselló) and I feel defrauded   though   you still feel some affection because he was our governor.""

58,Raucous celebrations erupt after Puerto Rico governor steps down. But uncertainty lies ahead,"Holly Yan, Andrea Diaz and Juan Carlos Lopez",7/25/19," Weeks of fury and protests gave way to celebrations and fireworks as Puerto Rico's  embattled governor  announced he'll step down. But the widespread jubilation was quickly tempered by a sobering reality: No one's sure what's next for  the US territory .  And as Gov.  Ricardo Rosselló  prepares to announce his successor, some say the woman next in line -- Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez -- would be just as problematic.  ""We don't want her, either,"" said Manuel Capella, a doctor from Arecibo. ""We'd keep protesting.""  Protesters revel after bringing down their governor Shortly after Rosselló announced his resignation, much of Puerto Rico turned into a massive block party. Festive music blared through the streets as fireworks lit up the sky.  Protesters have been frustrated for years over  poverty and alleged government corruption . But the final straw came this month, when Puerto Rico's  Center for Investigative Journalism  published hundreds of leaked government chats showing Rosselló and members of his inner circle sharing  profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages .  The targets included fellow politicians, members of the media and even victims of Hurricane Maria -- which  killed thousands of Puerto Ricans  in 2017.  After days of defiance, Rosselló caved to protesters' demands just as lawmakers were getting ready to start impeachment proceedings.  In a video posted Wednesday on Facebook, the governor said he will resign at 5 p.m. ET on August 2.  ""During the past few days, many of you have been practicing your right of freedom of expression,"" Rosselló said in his video. ""The claims have been overwhelming, and I have received them with the highest degree of humility."" He also used the video to tout accomplishments.  ""Today we have the first positive economic growth in over a decade with 4.1% of growth, and the lowest unemployment in all our history, relieving thousands of fathers and mothers from the suffering of poverty,"" Rosselló said.  ""I wish peace and progress for our people. Transformation and progress are not the work of just one person; it's the product of the work of the people."" Who will be the next governor?  Puerto Rico's secretary of state would normally be next in the line of succession. But that position is vacant after former Secretary of State Luis G. Rivera Marín -- who was one of the participants in the leaked chat -- resigned during this month's protests.  Next up would be Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez. But she's a longtime ally of Rosselló's, and some Puerto Ricans say they don't trust her.  ""That would be terrible. That's like taking out a cockroach and replacing (it) with another,"" said Nora Morales, a retired business owner in Old San Juan. Capella criticized the justice secretary's handling of the chat message scandal. The Justice Department did not issue summonses for those involved in the chats until  several days after the scandal was publicized , and also gave the participants a few days to turn over their cell phones for inspection. ""Why didn't she ask for their phones earlier to investigate?"" Capella said.  But Vázquez said she's ready to take the helm.  ""Once the resignation is official, if necessary, I will assume the historic mandate"" as dictated in the Puerto Rican constitution,  Vázquez said. It's possible the governor might try to appoint a new secretary of state in the coming week, before he formally steps down. That person would have to be approved by the legislature before he or she takes over as governor.  But Rosselló has hinted that Vázquez will likely be his successor.  ""At this time, according to legal order, that person would be the current secretary of the Department of Justice, the attorney Wanda Vázquez,"" Rosselló said in his video Wednesday.  The fight's not over Regardless of who succeeds Rosselló, the new governor faces tough challenges -- including a  tough economy, a difficult recovery from Hurricane Maria , and now an emboldened electorate.  ""Before, people would sit and watch TV and complain or do nothing,"" said García Coll, a member of a community organizing group made up mostly of artists and writers. ""People are not sitting in front of their TVs anymore. That's the difference. I call it a peaceful revolution.""  Cynthia García Coll, a psychologist who teaches at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, said the issues on the island go beyond the top leadership.  ""Rosselló is a symptom of a much deeper problem,"" she said.  Many Puerto Ricans have lost confidence in Rosselló's New Progressive Party, which favors US statehood, and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the current commonwealth status. But even though Rosselló is on his way out, his party still controls both sides of the legislature.  Senate president Thomas Rivera Schatz, who's also the new interim president of the New Progressive Party, said Rosselló's resignation ""puts an end to a very sad chapter in the history of Puerto Rico."" ""It was a difficult decision for him and his family, but it was the right one,"" Rivera said.  ""To the people of Puerto Rico, we assure you that our efforts to improve the quality of life here ... will remain strong, and nothing will divert us from said goal.""

57,Likely successor of Puerto Rico's disgraced governor in crosshairs of wary protesters,Ray Sanchez and Eric Levenson,7/25/19," Now that Puerto Rico Gov.  Ricardo Rosselló has said he will leave office  after major protests on the island, Secretary of Justice Wanda Vázquez Garced is next in line -- and in the crosshairs of wary demonstrators.  Vázquez became Secretary of Justice in January 2017. She's an ally of Rosselló, who wished her a happy birthday  in a tweet  just two weeks ago. She  retweeted the post  and said her ""commitment to justice and the people of PR is unwavering."" Still, she will have to convince many Puerto Ricans that she is more committed to them than to the disgraced governor and their pro-statehood New Progressive Party. In fact, protestors and critics behind the popular ""Ricky, resign"" hashtag, or #RickyRenuncia, are now pushing the trending #WandaRenuncia. ""Her positions and her character as a person is well aligned with what Ricardo Rosselló represents,"" said Mayra Velez Serrano, a professor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras. ""It's no surprise that Puerto Ricans don't want her either."" Many protesters consider Vazquez a liability Rosselló said this week he will  step down next Friday after being humbled by more than a week of protests  calling for his resignation. His own party has been prepared to begin impeachment proceedings. The 40-year-old's meteoric political collapse was triggered in part by the Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism's  publication of a series of group messages between the governor and his inner circle  that included homophobic and misogynistic language and jokes about Hurricane Maria victims. Puerto Rico's Constitution holds that the Secretary of State is next in line to the governorship, but Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin resigned amid the recent protests. The Secretary of Justice is next in the succession order. Putting off his resignation for a week gives Rosselló a little time to appoint a new Secretary of State.  Many Puerto Ricans are standing up against decades of corruption and mismanagement, and what they say is second-class treatment as a US territory, consider Vazquez a liability at such a crucial moment in the island's history.  Vazquez was cleared in an ethics investigation  Critics cite Vázquez's close ties to the outgoing governor as well as her own controversies and limited political experience. They accuse her of failing to open investigations against members of her own party, particularly Rosselló and his administration's handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017.  ""People were asking why weren't there investigations,"" Velez said. ""Was it was for political reasons? There is a lot of mistrust with that. There is this connection between that and why Puerto Ricans are upset with Rosselló."" Last year, Vazquez came under fire for allegedly intervening on behalf of her daughter in a case stemming from a home theft. She faced charges of violating government ethics laws. But a judge later ruled there was insufficient evidence to arrest her.  Days before the leaked chats this month, FBI agents arrested two ranking Rosselló officials -- including  Education Secretary Julia Keleher -- for allegedly directing contracts worth millions to politically connected firms.  ""People are saying that if it wasn't because of the FBI, we would never know about this corruption,"" Velez said. ""People don't believe in her capacity to uphold the law and hold people accountable. They see her as another person who is more about the political party."" Vázquez also has had a strained relationship with Thomas Rivera Schatz, the president of the Senate and likely new head of their party.  ""She will not only be facing the Puerto Rican people and their mistrust, but she will also be facing a political party led by a person who doesn't want her there,"" Velez said of Vasquez and Schatz.   'She is business as usual,' professor says Vázquez  was nominated as Secretary of Justice in December 2016. Her mandate includes fighting corruption, improving transparency, and supporting survivors of crime, according to the  Democratic Attorneys General Association . She earned her bachelor's degree in social sciences from the University of Puerto Rico and her law degree from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico School of Law, the organization says. She was a lawyer for the Department of Housing and then a prosecutor, often working on cases of domestic violence, sex offenses, and mistreatment of minors, it adds. ""She is business as usual,"" Cynthia García Coll, a protester who teaches at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, said of Vazquez. ""We are not going to be business as usual.""

19,Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló Resigns After Chat Scandal,Nick Visser,7/24/19,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned late Wednesday amid mass protests over the ongoing fallout from the publication of embarrassing chat messages and charges of corruption within his administration.Rosselló said in a video message that he would resign effective Aug. 2 at 5 p.m. local time. He said he will be replaced by Puerto Rico’s secretary of justice, Wanda Vazquez.Rosselló spent much of his 10-minute address reading off a list of his accomplishments while in office, saying he was successful at fighting corruption and working to lower taxes.“The results are what most matter, and they are favorable results in the worst scenario imaginable,” the governor said, according to a translation from The New York Times. He later noted that demands for his removal had been “overwhelming, and I’ve received them with the highest degree of humility.”The announcement of his resignation drew immediate celebration in San Juan as protesters burst into cheers and lighted fireworks over the capital.“Honored to be part of a country where people are fearless and take to the streets in a true act of hope and dignity,” Carmin Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, wrote on Twitter. “This has just begun. VIVA PUERTO RICO.”Earlier this week, hundreds of thousands of people marched through the streets of San Juan, the U.S. territory’s capital, shutting down major thoroughfares in one of the largest protests ever seen on the island.The demonstrations were largely centered on the publication of nearly 900 pages of messages from a private group chat among Rosselló and his close aides, a scandal dubbed “Chatgate.” Many of the messages were highly offensive. The men insulted women, people with disabilities and victims of 2017’s devastating Hurricane Maria.But the outrage also fed into widespread frustration with Rosselló’s leadership. Puerto Ricans have long voiced discontent with the languishing recovery efforts after Maria and a long-lasting economic crisis that has harshly affected everyday citizens. At the same time, several members of Rosselló’s administration have been arrested in recent weeks by federal officials as part of a sprawling corruption investigation.Law enforcement officials also seized several cellphones this week from some of the governor’s aides, although it’s unclear what charges could stem from the chat messages.Vazquez, Rosselló’s replacement, already faces heavy criticism. She has been the island’s secretary of justice since January 2017 but has been the subject of ethics complaints and has drawn some fierce political opposition. She has also faced calls to resign.If she assumes the governorship as planned, she would be the territory’s second-ever female leader.Rosselló, 40, had attempted to resist calls that he resign, saying Sunday that he planned to step down as the head of his party and not seek reelection next year.“I’ve made mistakes, and I apologize,” Rosselló said during remarks last week. “To every Puerto Rican man and woman, I have heard you and I hear you today.”President Donald Trump had attacked Rosselló amid the protests and the chat scandal, saying he was a “terrible governor” and calling himself the “best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico.”The White House has continually lambasted the cost associated with recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria, and Trump has complained that billions of dolllars in emergency funding has gone into the hands of “incompetent” and “very corrupt people.”The president has falsely claimed that the island had gotten about $92 billion in aid, but Congress has authorized only $42.5 billion in recovery money. Much of that hasn’t yet been sent to the island.Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $90 billion in damage, making it the third-costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, according to the federal government.This article has been updated with statements from Rosselló.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-governor-ricardo-rossello-resigns-scandal_n_5d37ca12e4b0419fd334b65a,HuffPost,Liberal
59,US politicians criticize embattled Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló,"Holly Yan, Ray Sanchez, Christina Maxouris and Amir Vera",7/23/19," As protests against Puerto Rico Gov.  Ricardo Rosselló  intensified on Monday, politicians on the US mainland joined the chorus of voices criticizing his leadership or calling for him to resign. ""He's a terrible governor,"" President Donald Trump said Monday, as hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans blocked a major highway and launched an island-wide strike demanding that the governor of the US territory resign. ""Governor Rosselló has exhibited a pattern of sexist, homophobic and entirely inappropriate behavior,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement, referencing the nearly  900 pages of leaked messages  between Rosselló and members of his inner circle that sparked the protests.  The  group chat messages  ""offended almost every group on the island,"" said Angel Rosa, a political science professor at the University of Puerto Rico. In them, one member of Rosselló's inner circle joked about victims of Hurricane Maria. ""While Puerto Ricans attempt to heal from Hurricane María, he mocks victims for a cheap laugh,"" de Blasio said. ""Governor Rosselló should resign immediately."" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that ""the ongoing crisis of faith in Governor Rosselló makes his continued leadership untenable and he should resign."" Though Rosselló announced Sunday that he would not seek reelection when his term is over, protesters say they won't rest until he has left office.   San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said the governor's refusal to step down has ""added fuel to the fire."" ""We are prepared here at City Hall with a makeshift emergency unit with medics and doctors and nurses to take in anybody that receives tear gas or has a cut in their body or potentially been shot,"" she said.   'This has never happened in Puerto Rico before'  Protests have been ongoing for the past week -- and older protesters said Monday's rally was one of the largest they've ever seen.  ""This has never happened in Puerto Rico before,"" Rosa said.  Police deployed tear gas into a crowd of protesters Monday night. Officers told the crowd of protesters who were behind a barricade to get back and gave them several verbal warnings on the speaker system.  Police also used an alarm siren on a loud speaker as a warning for the crowd to disperse.  Protesters did not heed the warnings, instead throwing water bottles and other objects at the police.  As the crowd dispersed, police fanned out along streets and alley's in Old San Juan and continued to use gas against pockets of protesters. The protesters spanned many generations and political leanings. Both supporters and opponents of US statehood came together for this cause. They say the offensive chat messages are just one of many reasons why Puerto Rico's leadership needs to go. ""I am fed up with the thieving government,"" protester Maristella Gross said. ""I am fed up with corruption. I am fed up with lack of integrity."" ""This is an opportunity to Puerto Rico to clean house, to start over,"" said Ediris Rivera, 23. Many protesters dripped with sweat, but Neysha Benitez, 24, didn't mind the sweltering heat. Even when it started raining, marchers were undeterred by the heavy downpours throughout the early afternoon. ""We cannot be silent anymore,"" Benitez said. ""Our voices need to be heard."" Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin --  one of the people targeted in Rosselló's messages  -- joined protesters Monday and urged officials to start the process of impeachment.  ""The only thing you (Rosselló) just did is mess with the mental health of Puerto Ricans,"" Martin tweeted. ""If he doesn't want to leave, (impeachment) is the only option we have."" Puerto Rican Reggaeton star Daddy Yankee, best known in the US for his part in the hit song "" Despacito ,"" was also present. ""It's obvious that we're angry because we're here and we saw a lot of things from the governor, but we're behaving as well,"" he said. ""I think we're demanding respect above everything and we deserve that."" Protests against Rosselló have also been held on the US mainland. People gathered at New York's Grand Central Terminal Monday evening to call for his resignation.  ""The group I was with protested at Columbus Circle for two hours in the rain,"" Andrew Padilla told CNN. ""Then took the streets from 7th avenue through Times Square and reached Grand Central where we just kept bumping into new (people). It was beautiful."" He said that ""folks came from all over"" to take part. Rosselló offers concessions, but they're not good enough On Sunday, the governor acknowledged in a Facebook Live post that a ""huge portion of the population is unhappy,"" and said that he would not run for reelection next year and would resign as the president of the New Progressive Party. Rosselló, who is about halfway into his four-year term, said he'll keep serving as governor until he can hand the work ""over to my democratically elected successor."" ""I have made mistakes, and I have apologized,"" he said. ""I am a good man who has a great love for my island and for everyone."" During a tense interview with Fox News the next day -- his first with a US outlet since the protests began -- Rosselló said he's ""not making light of the demonstrations.""  ""I have used words that I have apologized for, but I've also taken significant actions in the direction of helping vulnerable sectors in our population,"" he said, adding that his focus is to make sure the policies that he has enacted move forward. Rosselló stammered after being asked repeatedly who supported him during this tumultuous time, and said San Sebastian Mayor Javier Jiménez supported him.  Jimenez, however, released a statement Monday saying he is awaiting the findings of the committee that was created Friday to determine whether Rosselló committed impeachable offenses.  ""When the governor says that I support him in his desire to stay in power, he's wrong,"" Jimenez said. ""What I'm supporting is strict adherence to the Constitution."" While protesters stand their ground, Rosselló's New Progressive Party is quickly making changes.  Thomas Rivera Schatz, the president of Puerto Rico's Senate, announced Monday that he will be the party's new president.  ""To the Puerto Ricans who were offended, I reiterate that our party rejects this behavior, censures these expressions and is in solidarity with you,""  Rivera Schatz posted  on Facebook.  The unrest is also affecting the island's tourism industry. Royal Caribbean and MSC have canceled transit stops of their ""MSC Seaside"" and ""Celebrity Equinox"" cruises, according to Carla Campos, Puerto Rico's Tourism Company director.  ""The lines expressed concern about the demonstrations that could be generated in Old San Juan at night,"" Campos said in a statement.  Campos also said ""that the economic impact of cruise ship stops canceled to date could be estimated at around $2.5 million due to the expenditure of approximately 15,000 passengers."" Impeachment research committee at work The president of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives, Carlos ""Johnny"" Méndez, created a special committee Friday to advise him on whether the governor committed impeachable offenses. The impeachment research committee includes three attorneys who will have 10 days to provide Méndez with a detailed report, his spokesman Raúl Colón said. The committee will evaluate the content of the leaked messages between Rosselló and Cabinet members and determine if there's proof Rosselló committed a crime, Méndez said. If officials discover the governor did commit impeachable acts, and a vote to impeach passes the House, the issue would go to the Senate. A trial would be presided over by the head of the Supreme Court, with the senators as jurors.  A two-thirds vote is needed in both chambers for an impeachment to be carried out. Former Senate Vice President Orlando Parga said what Rosselló wrote in those leaked chats is derogatory and deeply offensive.  But he said matters of character should be judged at the polls next year.   Parga said if the governor is found to be involved in corruption, ""he should step down immediately."" ""But for what has been revealed up to now, I don't think ... this is sufficient to force him out of power."" 'We are going to stay here no matter what' Protesters say they're not backing down because they've endured political corruption, high poverty rates, crushing debt and a painful recovery since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017. Layzne Alvez told CNN  that Puerto Rico's government had been ""left to run wild with our economy, with our money, with all the federal funds the government are sending here.""  But Puerto Ricans aren't a violent people, she said, so they don't want to bring Rosselló down by force. ""We are going to stay here no matter what,"" Alvez said. ""We are going to force our local leaders, representatives, senators, whoever we need to, to get him out. We are going to stay here.""

20,Trump: 'I'm The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Puerto Rico',Julian Shen-Berro,7/22/19,"As hundreds of thousands gathered in the streets of San Juan to call for the removal of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, President Donald Trump launched harsh verbal attacks on Puerto Rican officials.Puerto Rico’s governor has refused to leave office after leaked messages revealed he and other government officials privately insulted women, people with disabilities and victims of Hurricane Maria. Trump told reporters on Monday that the governor and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz were “grossly incompetent.”While Cruz is not implicated in the governor’s scandal, she earned the president’s ire as one of his major critics in the wake of the 2017 hurricane. Cruz called Trump’s initial failure to stem the island’s loss of life — one analysis estimated the hurricane killed 2,975 people — “a violation of human rights.” In return, the president said he would not support Puerto Rican statehood if she continued to hold office.On Monday, Trump continued his attack, saying Cruz was “so bad for her people” and claiming she mishandled funds allocated to the island by Congress. In attacking the two figures, Trump falsely stated that Congress “gave Puerto Rico $92 billion last year” as evidence of their incompetence.This is not the first time he has cited such a large and inaccurate number. In May, The Washington Post reported that the island had been allocated less than half of that, and that the president’s number seemed to be a projection for spending over the next 20 years.Trump later claimed to be “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico,” citing a number of bizarre reasons while trying to justify the statement.“They don’t like to give me the credit for it, but we did a great job [in Puerto Rico],” he said. “I have many Puerto Rican friends. I have a real understanding of Puerto Rico. I’ve had jobs in Puerto Rico.”Trump did not delve into specifics of the “great job” he believed his administration had accomplished, but did refer to what he saw as a “tremendous” success that occurred before his presidency began.“I own the Miss Universe contest and we had them in Puerto Rico, twice. And I’ll tell you, we had tremendous successes,” the president said. “In fact, they said literally 100% — this never happens — almost, I think it was close to 100, but 100% of the island itself was watching. They like those pageants.”Though the Trump administration faced criticism for its slow response to the hurricane, this is not the first time the president has congratulated himself for the island’s recovery effort.“Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being, and I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it,” he said in March.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico_n_5d3608d9e4b020cd9947ad21,HuffPost,Liberal
60,"Steps away from Puerto Rico's massive protests, one church closes its doors in fear of violence",Christina Maxouris and Leyla Santiago,7/22/19," Down the street from La Fortaleza -- the mansion of Puerto Rico's embattled governor -- is the oldest cathedral on the island, San Juan Bautista Cathedral.  It's where many locals come to pray and find comfort amid the protests that have roiled the US territory since last week. But on Monday, the church won't offer refuge.  Its doors will be closed, as they were for most of the day Sunday for safety reasons, Father Benjamin Perez told CNN. Last week, the church's doors were spray-painted with the words ""resign dictator"" and the building was damaged. Now, with thousands expected to protest through the capital on Monday, Perez is afraid people may burn the building's doors. ""The people are sad. There is a lot of pain. There is anger,"" Perez told CNN. ""But I tell them we have to ask for that peace that we need in these moments."" Puerto Ricans want Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to resign, after Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism published a series of profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages between Rosselló and other members of his inner circle. And residents say this is just one of the list of reasons -- including ongoing government corruption and economic instability -- why they're rallying on the streets. ""It's not the same to see it on TV than it is to be here,"" Perez says. ""Sometimes it makes you want to cry."" Despite the turmoil, Sunday mass hosted the same number of people as every other week, he said.  And during the service, a common theme: peace.  ""Let's ask our Holy Mother that we use a prudent vocabulary that's not offensive, but that will help us strengthen and consolidate peace and reconciliation in our country. Peace needs to be built and that's a great challenge we face now,"" Perez said.   ""Puerto Rico is not alone, Our Mother in Heaven accompanies it in this crucial moment in history. Let's ask our Mother to intercede to God so that Puerto Rico can find  the pathway to peace and reconciliation """,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/us/puerto-rico-priest-san-juan-bautista-cathedral/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjzi-Kj5cj6AhWyQzABHYFYASA4vgEQFnoECAEQAg&usg=AOvVaw0f5l7C-oe2SjWT6AcAOC9r,CNN,Liberal
61,Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announces he will not run for reelection next year,Ray Sanchez and Amir Vera,7/21/19," Puerto Rico Gov.  Ricardo Rosselló  announced Sunday that he will not run for reelection next year and is resigning as the president of the New Progressive Party, following  protests  over the past week. ""A huge portion of the population is unhappy and I recognize it,"" Rosselló said on  Facebook Live . ""I've heard you, I love the island and people. ... Today I have the responsibility to direct my strengths to try to find alternatives so that with God we may be able to move forward.""  Rosselló is two and a half years into his four year term. ""I'm going to be looking forward to turning over power to the person elected democratically,"" he said. Rosselló did not say he would resign as governor of the US territory, upsetting residents who have been  calling for his resignation  after offensive private  chat messages  between Rosselló and his inner circle were made public last week.  ""We want him gone, that's it,"" Xavier Garcia, 28, said. ""It's about respect."" Jomaries Amezaga, 40, told CNN she knew Rosselló wasn't going to step down.  ""He's like a little child having a tantrum. He's lived an easy life of privilege and he doesn't want to give it up,"" Amezaga said.  Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, also called for his resignation Sunday.  ""It is a good first step but he must resign as governor and allow another to finish the term,"" González-Colón said in a statement. She also serves as the vice president of the New Progressive Party.  Puerto Rico Senator Eduardo Bhatia told CNN that Rosselló ""is totally disconnected from reality"" and that the impeachment process must begin. He said that Puerto Ricans ""are scared to death.""  ""We feel that we are on a plane and the pilot has lost control,"" Bhatia said. ""We want to get rid of the pilot."" The scene outside of La Fortaleza, the governor's mansion, was like a massive block party after the announcement, in stark contrast to the tense protests in recent days. People yelled anti-Rosselló chants, waved Puerto Rican flags and blasted music. Vendors were selling ""resign Rosselló"" T-shirts.  Rafael ""June"" Rivera Ortega, secretary general of the New Progressive Party, said in a statement that working with Rosselló ""has been a true honor."" After a new party president has been chosen, Ortega said he too will step down as secretary general.  ""During these two and a half years, we have made great progress in terms of the reorganization of our party, reinforcing the message of Statehood, and we have been able to carry out multiple special elections without controversy, creating unity of our party,"" Ortega said.  Governor not considering resigning Last week, the Center for Investigative Journalism published nearly 900 pages of leaked chats from the governor's private Telegram Messenger group, in which he and 11 top aides and Cabinet members exchanged profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages about fellow politicians, members of the media and celebrities. In one, Christian Sobrino Vega, then Puerto Rico's chief financial officer, appeared to joke about those who died in  Hurricane Maria . Puerto Rico's Justice Department  has issued summonses  for everyone involved in the private chat group. They will be ordered to appear before Justice Department officials to have their phones inspected, department spokeswoman Mariana Cobian said. As protests continued last week, Rosselló consistently refused to step down. In a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday, he said he would continue to work toward regaining the Puerto Rican people's trust. ""I recognize the challenge that I have before me because of the recent controversies, but I firmly believe that it is possible to restore confidence and that we will be able, after this painful process, to achieve reconciliation,"" he said. On Friday, his  official Instagram account shared images  of the governor at work, as if it were a typical day for his administration. The same day, Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira said that the governor ""is not considering resignation."" New allegations of corruption The leaked messages were not the only thing driving the protests. Demonstrators have also alleged  government corruption , as the island battles high poverty rates, crushing debt and a painful recovery from 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria. On Saturday, Rosselló's longtime family friend and business partner, Yosem E. Companys, claimed in an interview with  news outlet NotiCel  that the governor had accepted money from the island's legislature for access to his father, a former governor. Companys claimed Rosselló told him he kept up to a million dollars in bank accounts, according to the report. Rosselló said on Twitter that the allegations were ""totally false."" ""It is truly lamentable and disappointing that a person which I considered a friend would make such ill-intentioned and false comments,"" the governor tweeted. Companys told NotiCel that the payments came up when he was discussing a business investment with Rosselló. ""Ricky told me he had all the money we needed. I asked him if it was family money,"" Companys told NotiCel. ""He told me, 'Don't say anything, but basically I get paid around $100,000 to $200,000 as adviser to the legislature and I don't have to do anything. The only thing I have to do is when they want to contact my dad, I give them access,"" Companys said. Companys said he asked Rosselló whether he thought it was unethical, according to the report, and that Rosselló told him, ""I am on their payroll; that's how things function in Puerto Rico."" The exchange occurred between 2006 and 2007, Companys said. Committee checks possible impeachable offenses The president of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives, Carlos ""Johnny"" Méndez, created a special committee Friday to advise him on whether the governor committed impeachable offenses. The impeachment research committee includes three attorneys who will have 10 days to provide Méndez with a detailed report, according to a news release from his spokesman, Raúl Colón. The committee will evaluate the content of the leaked messages between Rosselló and Cabinet members and determine if there's proof Rosselló committed a crime, Méndez said. ""We are here to order this evaluation, one that will be transparent and responsible,"" he said. ""I thank this group of lawyers for giving a step forward in this historic moment for Puerto Rico. We will thoroughly evaluate the conclusions of this committee so we can proceed."" If it is found that the governor did commit impeachable acts, and a vote to impeach passes the House, it goes to the Senate and a trial presided over by the head of the Supreme Court, with the senators as jurors. A two-thirds vote is needed in both chambers for the impeachment to go through.  CNN's Ray Sanchez reported from San Juan, while Amir Vera reported and wrote in Atlanta.

21,Ricardo Rosselló Won't Seek Reelection As Puerto Rico Governor Amid 'Chatgate' Scandal,Hayley Miller,7/21/19,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said he will not seek reelection next year and will step down as head of his party, but will not resign amid calls that he leave office after embarrassing online chats with other officials were leaked and charges of corruption in his administration spread, he announced in a brief video on Facebook Sunday.“I’ve made mistakes, and I apologize,” Rosselló said during his remarks, according to a translation from BuzzFeed. “To every Puerto Rican man and woman, I have heard you and I hear you today.”The 40-year-old Democrat, whose administration has struggled to navigate the aftermath of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, drew anger earlier this month after his private chats with other officials were leaked to the media.The scandal, known as “Chatgate,” involved hundreds of pages of messages between Rosselló and members of his administration in which the men insulted women, people with disabilities and victims of the hurricane.In one chat, Rosselló called Melissa Mark-Viverito, the former speaker of the New York City Council, the Spanish word for “whore.” In another, he accused San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of being “off her meds” after she announced her intent to run against him for governor in 2020.“Either that, or she’s a tremendous HP,” he wrote, using the Spanish acronym for “son/daughter of a bitch.”Rosselló blamed long working hours for his “hurtful” comments and quickly apologized to those he had offended after his private chats were leaked.“I’m the governor of Puerto Rico, but I’m a human being who has his faults,” he said during a news conference earlier this month. “I ask for forgiveness.”But his apology was too little too late for Puerto Ricans fed up with the relentless scandal and hardship that has plagued their community since back-to-back hurricanes ravaged the island in 2017, resulting in thousands of deaths.Initiatives to restore power to the island were stalled by unlawful contract bids. Budget cuts handed down by Rosselló’s administration prompted school closings and threatened pensions for retirees across the territory.Earlier this month, Rosselló’s education secretary was arrested after being accused of funneling federal money to unqualified, politically connected contractors. The arrest followed charges against multiple Puerto Rican officials, from current and previous administrations, of corruption and misuse of funds.Rosselló, a native of San Juan, was sworn in as governor in January 2017. Previously, he served as chair of the Puerto Rico New Progressive Party. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering and economics.His father, Pedro Rosselló, served as the island territory’s governor from 1993 to 2001.This is a developing story.

63,Impeachment committee forms in Puerto Rico as protesters call for Gov. Rosselló to resign,"Mayra Cuevas, Dakin Andone and Amir Vera",7/20/19," As thousands of people crowded the streets calling for  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló  to step down, the president of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives created a special committee on Friday to advise him   on whether the governor committed impeachable offenses.  The committee's formation comes after days of protests, sparked in part by the leaks of offensive private chat messages between the US territory's governor and his inner circle,  while the island has battled  high poverty rates, crushing government debt and a painful recovery from 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria. The impeachment research committee includes three attorneys who will have 10 days to provide a detailed report to Carlos ""Johnny"" Méndez, according to a news release from the House leader's spokesman, Raúl Colón. The committee will evaluate the content of leaked messages between Rosselló and Cabinet members and determine if there's proof Rosselló committed a crime, Méndez said. ""We are here to order this evaluation, one that will be transparent and responsible,"" he said. ""I thank this group of lawyers for giving a step forward in this historic moment for Puerto Rico. We will thoroughly evaluate the conclusions of this committee so we can proceed."" The chaos in Puerto Rico follows the Center for Investigative Journalism's publication of nearly 900 pages of   leaked chats from the governor's private Telegram Messenger group in which he and 11 top aides and Cabinet members exchanged profanity-laced,  homophobic and misogynistic messages  about fellow politicians, members of the media and celebrities. In one, the former chief financial officer appeared to joke about those who died in Maria. While  Rosselló  has refused to step down, two Cabinet members who participated in the chats  resigned July 13.  And on Friday, one of his aides -- press secretary Dennise Peréz -- also stepped down.  In her resignation letter, Peréz lamented that someone had called her corrupt in front of her son. ""While holding my head high and my family close, I thought I could go through anything and continued doing my job professionally, just how I have been for the last 20 years,"" she said. ""Like you are aware, this week, a citizen, without any consideration, called me corrupt and did it in front of my son. This is where I draw the line."" The leak came the same week that two former officials from Rosselló's administration  were arrested by the FBI  as part of a federal corruption investigation. 'You left us to die' Thousands of protesters gathered Friday night in the capital of San Juan calling for Rosselló's resignation. Layzne Alvez told CNN the territory's government had been ""left to run wild with our economy, with our money, with all the federal funds the government are sending here."" She added that Puerto Ricans weren't a violent people so they did not plan to bring Rosselló down by force.  ""We are going to stay here no matter what,"" Alvez said. ""We are going to force our local leaders, representatives, senators, whoever we need to, to get him out. We are going to stay here."" Protesters have jammed the streets of San Juan over the last several days. Hundreds gathered in front of the Capitol on Wednesday and marched to the governor's mansion, playing tambourines and banging on pots and pans. At times police have fired canisters of tear gas into the crowds. ""Unfortunately, there is always corruption in the government,"" said Pamela Calderón, the owner of a small restaurant on Calle San Jose. ""But with the publication of the chats, people in Puerto Rico saw how  the corruption affected the response to the hurricane. There's a sense of, 'You left us to die.'""  ""There are still people without electricity or a roof,"" she added. ""There is a perception of being abandoned by the government, a lack of planning, and the inept way government managed the crisis.""  The scandal made people snap out of their complacency, a restaurant manager in Old San Juan said. ""We usually wait for things to take their course,"" Jose Ramos said. ""But this will not get resolved without pressure.""  Politicians from both sides of the aisle   are calling for Rosselló's resignation.  ""It's time for the governor to have an orderly transition of government so that this doesn't continue affecting us in DC as it pertains to obtaining federal funds for the island,""   said  Jenniffer González , Puerto Rico's nonvoting representative in the US Congress, known as the resident commissioner. ""The disbursement of funds to the island will obviously suffer dramatically if he remains on the position."" US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has called on Rosselló to resign, and she traveled to Puerto Rico late this week. She was  in Old San Juan on Friday night  ""to stand with the people of Puerto Rico against corruption,"" she wrote on Facebook. Hawaii and Puerto Rico ""share many of the same experiences and stories,"" she wrote on  Twitter .  ""I stand with Puerto Ricans demanding change, who have had enough of government corruption, and who deserve a government of, by, and FOR the people. El pueblo unido jamás será vencido. #RickyRenuncia,"" Gabbard tweeted.  US Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, also  said in a tweet  that Rosselló should step down.  ""I've long advocated for the families of Puerto Rico. I've pledged to be their voice in the Senate. While I've been hesitant to weigh in too heavily on the internal political affairs of the island, it's clear that the current leadership has lost the confidence of the people of PR,"" Scott tweeted. ""The island deserves new leadership.""  Protesters have been joined by some of Puerto Rico's biggest stars, including reggaeton star Bad Bunny, rapper René Pérez Joglar and singer and actor Ricky Martin, one of the targets of leaked homophobic messages. And similar demonstrations have taken place on the US mainland in cities like Miami and Orlando, Florida.  ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito attended protests at New York's Union Square. ""I'm so numb from politics in America. But the people of Puerto Rico are numb, and they are waking us all up. I'm going to have their backs,"" Miranda told CNN. Governor not considering resigning  Puerto Rico's Justice Department  has issued summonses  for everyone involved in the private chat group. They will be ordered to appear before Justice Department officials to have their phones inspected, department spokeswoman Mariana Cobian said. Through it all, Rosselló has refused to step down, and on Friday his official Instagram account  shared images of the governor at work , as if it were a typical day for his administration. Rosselló ""is not considering resignation,"" Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira said Friday morning.  In a statement posted to Twitter, Rosselló said he would continue to work toward regaining the Puerto Rican people's trust.  ""I recognize the challenge that I have before me because of the recent controversies, but I firmly believe that it is possible to restore confidence and that we will be able, after this painful process, to achieve reconciliation,"" he said.  But the calls for his ouster have yet to die down.  ""He's still holding onto power, we don't want him any more here,"" said Alvez, the protester. ""He says we voted for him, so that's why he's staying in power, but we don't want you anymore, I don't know how you don't get this. We don't care if some people voted for you, we don't care if the whole island voted for you."" González, the island's resident commissioner, said in  a letter to the governor  that the protests and scandal have painted ""a lawless Puerto Rico for the rest of the world.""  ""It is time to give stability to Puerto Rico so that we can continue the reconstruction that was planned before the events of the last weeks and return the credibility of the government of Puerto Rico within the Federal Capital, the financial markets, tourism and the whole world,"" González wrote.

64,Tulsi Gabbard joins Puerto Rico protests: 'The most important thing is a corrupt governor steps down',Veronica Stracqualursi,7/20/19," Democratic Hawaii Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  joined  thousands of protesters  in Puerto Rico Saturday in demanding that Gov. Ricardo Rosselló step down, taking action on a chorus of calls from 2020 presidential contenders for the embattled governor's resignation. ""I stand in solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico who have been suffering and struggling under this very corrupt government for far too long,"" Gabbard told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in an interview from San Juan. ""They are saying enough is enough. I join them in calling for this governor's resignation. They can then begin to find a leader who will truly listen to their concerns and work for their interests."" Mass protests erupted after  Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism  published  leaked chats  between Rosselló and his inner circle, including profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages about fellow politicians, members of the media and celebrities. Rosselló has rejected calls to resign. Gabbard flew to the island on Friday, and on Saturday told CNN, ""I'm doing what I can to lift this up to the national conversation.""  Asked if she's concerned the island could see increased instability should Rosselló resign without a clear successor, the 2020 presidential hopeful told CNN, ""The most important thing is a corrupt governor steps down."" ""You can say this is messy, but this is democracy in action,"" she said. Gabbard previously said in a statement that the protests, which have lasted all week, are about more than ""offensive language,"" but about ""rampant corruption within Puerto Rico's government."" She urged her fellow 2020 candidates to come to the island ""even if it's just for a day, to show your support for the Puerto Rican people and their righteous cause."" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg , New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and author Marianne Williamson had said Thursday that they stand in solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico, and former secretary of Housing and Urban Development  Julián Castro  on Friday directly called on Rosselló to resign. ""Americans in Puerto Rico are holding Governor (Rosselló) accountable for his disgraceful comments (and) corruption,"" Castro tweeted Friday morning. ""I stand with the Puerto Ricans in the streets protesting for his resignation. Excessive force against them is not acceptable."" While campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, Castro later told reporters that Rosselló ""can no longer be effective and I believe that he should resign."" Castro surveyed the island's recovery efforts from Hurricane Maria in a visit to San Juan in January -- his first as a declared 2020 candidate. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- who had also  visited the island in January  when she was exploring a run for president but had not yet jumped into the 2020 race -- also called for Rosselló's resignation Friday, saying his ""actions are hurtful and undermine the public trust."" ""I've been standing with the people of Puerto Rico in their protests against corruption and their governor's behavior. The people have spoken — loud and clear: (Rosselló) should resign,"" Warren tweeted after hesitating earlier in the week to go as far. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan on Saturday echoed  the calls  for the governor to resign, and California Sen. Kamala Harris  signaled her support  for protesters.  In a  tweet  on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden called Rosselló's comments shameful but stopped short of calling for his resignation.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted later Saturday that he joined Puerto Ricans ""in calling for the immediate resignation of Governor Rosselló"" and for more federal support for the island's hurricane recovery. ""Puerto Rico deserves a governor who is accountable, transparent, and capable of leading the island to recovery after Hurricane Maria, which was almost two years ago,"" he wrote. ""The federal government must provide full support in this effort."" The 2020 candidates are among the many politicians putting pressure on Rosselló to leave office.  Democratic New York Reps. Nydia Velázquez and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have joined the chorus of elected officials calling on Rosselló to exit his position. Velázquez was born in Puerto Rico and Ocasio-Cortez is of Puerto Rican descent. Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said in a  tweet  late Friday that the ""island deserves new leadership."" ""I've long advocated for the families of Puerto Rico. I've pledged to be their voice in the Senate. While I've been hesitant to weigh in too heavily on the internal political affairs of the island, it's clear that the current leadership has lost the confidence of the people of PR,"" Scott wrote. Puerto Rico's sole representative to Congress, Jenniffer González-Colón, told CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez in an interview that she wants Rosselló to step down from leading the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico and as governor.  In an open letter posted on both  Twitter  and Facebook, González-Colón said it's time for Puerto Rico to move forward.

62,Puerto Rico protests: Demonstrations resume Saturday outside Gov. Rosselló's official residence,"Mayra Cuevas, Jason Hanna and Amir Vera",7/20/19," Demonstrators calling for Puerto Rico  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló 's resignation gathered in streets outside the governor's mansion again Saturday afternoon, chanting and banging pots and pans in the latest of several days of protests on the US territory. The protests are sparked in part by last weekend's leaks of offensive private chat messages between the governor and his inner circle. But demonstrators also have railed against alleged government corruption, even as the  island battles  high poverty rates, crushing debt and a painful recovery from 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria. Saturday, scores of demonstrators stood at least a block from the governor's residence, known as La Fortaleza, facing a line of security officers who kept the crowd from approaching the building any closer. Two kilometers to the east, about a couple dozen people gathered around a covered table set up outside the Capitol building, listening to a protester read the chat messages that served as the boiling point for this week's unrest. One of those gathered there, Carla Claudio, said the chat messages formed ""a ridiculous document, but a historic one."" ""It's important to read this, do it collectively,"" Claudio, 32, of San Juan, said. ""It's been the catalyst for the protest and everything that's happened."" Thousands of demonstrators also crowded San Juan's streets  Friday , another in a string of protests over the past week that at times have seen police respond by  firing tear gas . Rosselló's aides have said he does not intend to step down. He has not responded to CNN's interview requests. The chaos in Puerto Rico follows the Center for Investigative Journalism's publication of nearly 900 pages of leaked chats from the governor's private Telegram Messenger group in which he and 11 top aides and Cabinet members exchanged profanity-laced,  homophobic and misogynistic messages  about fellow politicians, members of the media and celebrities.  In one, the former chief financial officer appeared to joke about those who died in Maria. The leak came the same week that two former officials from Rosselló's administration  were arrested by the FBI  as part of a federal corruption investigation. While  Rosselló  has refused to step down, two Cabinet members who participated in the chats  resigned July 13.  And Friday, one of his aides -- press secretary Dennise Peréz -- also  stepped down , saying she was upset that a citizen had called her corrupt in front of her son.  Governor denies new accusation Saturday, Rosselló denied an accusation, reported by news outlet NotiCel, that he was paid by the island's legislature for access to his father, a former governor, and kept up to a million dollars in bank accounts. Rosselló said on Twitter that was ""totally false."" ""It is truly lamentable and disappointing that a person which I considered a friend would make such ill-intentioned and false comments. I don't know his intentions and ask myself what is behind such similar falsities,"" the governor tweeted. The accusation comes from Rosselló's longtime family friend and business partner, Yosem E. Companys. Companys told NotiCel he was discussing a business investment with Rosselló.  ""Ricky told me he had all the money we needed. I asked him if it was family money,"" Companys told NotiCel. ""No, I have it,"" Rosselló reportedly told him. ""He told me, 'I have a million in bank accounts.'  ""To which I asked, 'From where?'  ""He told me, 'Don't say anything, but basically I get paid around $100,000 to $200,000 as adviser to the legislature and I don't have to do anything. The only thing I have to do is when they want to contact my dad, I give them access,"" Companys said.  Companys asked him whether he thought it was unethical, according to the report, and Rosselló reportedly told him, ""I am on their payroll; that's how things function in Puerto Rico.""  The exchange occurred between 2006 and 2007, Companys said.  New committee checks possible impeachable offenses Friday, the president of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives created a special committee to advise him on whether the governor committed impeachable offenses.

65,"'Something needs to change': Tensions keep rising in Puerto Rico, and more protests are coming",Nicole Chavez and Mayra Cuevas,7/19/19," For the past few nights, protesters  demanding Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's resignation  have been  tear-gassed  outside Francisco Caballeira's apartment.  Each night, he's rushed to help them. ""We threw a hose down the balcony, so people could wash off the tear gas,"" said Caballeira, 36. He and his fiancee opened the doors of their second-floor apartment -- about a block from the governor's mansion -- to strangers who have marched on the colonial streets of Old San Juan for days.  ""There's a lot of tension,"" Caballeira said. ""Everyone agrees that something needs to change. People are finally reacting to the level of corruption and abuse of the government.""  The protests erupted after Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism published  leaked chats between Gov. Rosselló and his inner circle , including profanity-laced, homophobic and misogynistic messages about fellow politicians, members of the media.  Nearly a week after the messages were made public, it's impossible to walk the streets of Old San Juan without seeing signs of the protests calling for Rosselló's ouster. On the streets, a lottery salesman and an ice cream vendor talked to their customers about the demonstrations. Crews covered spray-painted graffiti messages that read ""Ricky Resign"" with white paint. Some people cleaned shattered glass from about a dozen storefronts and boarded up doors and windows.  Restaurants and shops impacted by protests Juan Guerrero, 38, was serving drinks at a pizzeria a few blocks away from the governor's mansion when protests intensified on Monday.  The bartender, his colleagues and several patrons quickly barricaded inside the restaurant and let some protesters take shelter in the building.  ""It was packed,"" Guerrero said. When the tear gas canisters began to fly, Guerrero said they had to close the doors, but one eventually found its way inside the building through the open indoor garden. Yulissa Contreras, a server at the restaurant, said her family couldn't believe she was in the middle of the unrest. ""When my family saw the images on international television they thought it was something happening in Venezuela, not here,"" she said. The protests have forced businesses in the area to temporarily close or adjust their hours. The pizzeria has remained open for fewer hours in the past days and plans to start closing early if the unrest continues. Caballeira is also preparing for more protests. He has purchased a trauma kit and stocked up on water bottles and soap to help protesters if more tear gas is deployed again. And he's discussed what to do in case gunfire or a massive fire breaks out. ""Where should we put people?"" Caballeira said.  Puerto Rico governor says protests have 'not gone unnoticed' Hours after police officers sprayed tear gas on protestors on Wednesday night, Rosselló said he respects the people's right to protest and their actions have ""not gone unnoticed."" In a statement posted on Twitter, Rosselló said he's asked for the Puerto Rican people's forgiveness and will continue to do so.  ""I recognize the challenge that I have before me because of the recent controversies, but I firmly believe that it is possible to restore confidence and that we will be able, after this painful process, to achieve reconciliation."" He also said ""I have the commitment, stronger than ever, to carry out the public policy."" The governor has previously said he would not step down.  More protests expected Friday Several groups, including representatives from the labor movement and unions, are calling for more protests. Marches and ""cacerolazos"" -- protests with people banging pots and pans -- were expected across the island Friday and through the weekend. A massive march at the Luis A. Ferré Express has been planned for Sunday. Angel Figueroa Jaramillo, president of local labor union UTIER, said they want the Puerto Rican government to declare a state of emergency and change a controversial law, known as Promesa, that has been used to tackle the territory's debt. ""Aside from asking for the governor to resign, we demand the government to declare a state of emergency over the male chauvinist (machista) violence in Puerto Rico, we want to abolish the Promesa law, pause the bankruptcy process taking place in a federal court during this crisis, and annul the bonus accords negotiated by the Junta until the debt is audited,"" Jaramillo said. Jose Ramos, 28, a restaurant manager in Old San Juan, called this week's protests unprecedented. He said the text messages scandal made people snap out of their complacency.  ""We usually wait for things to take their course. But this will not get resolved without pressure,"" Ramos said. Ramos sees only three possibilities that could bring an end the chaos: the governor resigns, he's impeached or arrested by a federal agency. Whatever the outcome may be, Ramos hopes whoever replaces him will be trustworthy. ""There needs to be a proper process,"" he said. ""The people must be able to trust the person that inherits the position for what's left of the term.""  CNN's Mayra Cuevas reported from San Juan and Nicole Chavez wrote from Atlanta.

67,Puerto Rico protesters are clearing the streets after a night of demonstrations included police firing tear gas,"Nicole Chavez, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Leyla Santiago, Mayra Cuevas and Meridith Edwards",7/18/19," Protesters calling for the resignation of Gov.  Ricardo Rosselló  began clearing the streets in the early morning hours of Thursday, after a night of heated demonstrations that culminated in demonstrators overturning barricades and police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""We are tired of the abuse, of so many years of corruption,"" a protester, Leishka Flores, told CNN. ""We are here to make a revolution."" A series of protests began days ago when  nearly 900 pages of leaked chats from a governor's private Telegram Messenger group , obtained by Puerto Rico's  Center for Investigative Journalism , were published over the weekend.  ""He needs to know that no one in Puerto Rico wants him,"" another protester told the crowd. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Capitol on Wednesday for one of the week's largest protests and walked together to the governor's official residence, known locally as La Fortaleza.  Before reaching the governor's mansion, protesters walked playing tambourines, and banging pots and pans along with some of Puerto Rico's biggest stars.  Singer and actor Ricky Martin, reggaeton star Bad Bunny and rapper René Pérez Joglar, known as Residente, joined protesters in the American territory's capital. ""This government has to begin respecting the people,"" Residente told the crowd. ""We can't stop protesting."" Bad Bunny held a sign saying ""Ricky resign"" in Spanish. As protesters reached the governor's mansion, they met a barricade of police in riot gear blocking the street but continued chanting against Rosselló for hours. ""I'm here to fight for my rights and my daughter's rights,"" a protester, Andrea Batista, told CNN. ""I'm tired of getting robbed.""  Protests on the mainland Similar demonstrations took place in US mainland cities like Miami and Orlando, Florida. ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, former New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito attended protests at New York's Union Square.  ""I'm so numb from politics in America. But the people of Puerto Rico are numb and they are waking us all up. I'm going to have their backs,"" Miranda told CNN. Earlier on Wednesday, Puerto Rico's Justice Department issued summonses for everyone involved in the private chat group with Rosselló. The participants, which include 11 of the governor's top aides and Cabinet members, will be ordered to appear before department officials over three days and their cellphones will be inspected, department spokeswoman Mariana Cobian said.  Though Cobian said all participants of the private chat were being summoned, she declined to provide a list of names. The FBI would neither confirm nor deny whether if it was separately investigating the chats, bureau spokesman Luis Rivera said. Governor says he won't resign Rosselló announced he would not step down Tuesday, hours after  police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters  calling for his ouster. He also defended the actions of police and accused protesters of unleashing tear gas and setting fires during demonstrations Monday night.   ""I have not committed any illegal or corrupt acts,"" he said. ""I committed inappropriate acts and have expressed regret for that.""   The leaks came the same week that two former officials from Rosselló's administration were arrested by the FBI as part of a federal corruption investigation.  Rosselló has not responded to CNN's interview requests.  The governor promised to work to restore the public's confidence in him and noted that he has much work left to do.   ""Despite the difficulties that we have internal and external, the work will continue and the agenda will be completed in all areas,"" he said. ""You do not give up on work already started, and today, more than ever, a lot of people are counting on my commitment to do so."" If Rosselló were to resign, the law says the secretary of state, a post that is currently empty, is next in line to take the helm, followed by the island's treasurer. San Juan Mayor urged residents to join protests The messages, dubbed ""RickyLeaks,"" contain profanity-laden, homophobic and misogynistic messages aimed at opposition politicians, journalists and celebrities.  Among the  insults  Rosselló hurls in the chats: He calls a Puerto Rican-born New York official a ""whore"" and says she should be beaten; says an oversight board managing the island's financial crisis can ""go f*** yourself""; and tells one of this then-top officials that he'd be doing him a ""grand favor"" by shooting San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.  That official -- Christian Sobrino Vega, ex-chief fiscal officer and Rosselló's representative on the aforementioned oversight board -- also was implicated in the withering chats, making a homophobic remark about singer Ricky Martin and  mocking those killed in Hurricane Maria .  Yulín Cruz, a member of the opposition Popular Democratic Party who is running for governor, told CNN on Wednesday that the chats demonstrate that Rosselló and his supporters were hoping to silence their critics. She encouraged residents of her city, the territory's capital, to join in demonstrations demanding the governor's ouster.  ""This is the people of Puerto Rico ... clamoring for whatever is left of our democracy to be saved so we can begin to move away from the darkness of Ricardo Rosselló,"" she said. ""I am not advocating violence. I always advocate peaceful resistance, but just like (the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.) said, I cannot condemn the indignation of people."" She has filed a report over what she called Rosselló's and Sobrino Vega's death threat against her, she said, and has called on the Legislature to begin impeachment proceedings immediately.  Ahead of Wednesday's protests in San Juan, Yulín Cruz said she won't allow police officers to block or injure demonstrators.  ""I'm not going to cooperate with his (Roselló's) abuses. I won't be part of his efforts to criminalize the legitimate right of the people of Puerto Rico to ask for his resignation,"" she said.

66,"Two-thirds of Americans support statehood for Puerto Rico, Gallup finds",Paul LeBlanc,7/18/19," Two in three Americans support statehood for the US territory of Puerto Rico,  a Gallup Poll released Thursday found , a figure that's largely consistent with where public support for reclassifying the island has been for decades.  The poll found 66% of Americans support statehood for the island with notably high backing from Democrats (83%) and younger voters between 18 and 29 (80%). American support for Puerto Rico statehood has remained between 59% to 65% since 1962, according to Gallup.  But even with consistent support from a majority of the American public,  Puerto Rico statehood remains an elusive challenge.  Legislation declaring Puerto Rico a US state would have to navigate Congress and a Republican Party that holds less support for granting the island statehood.  Thursday's poll found a majority of Republicans -- 48% -- oppose statehood for Puerto Rico while 45% support it.  In September 2018, President Donald Trump said he did not support Puerto Rico statehood.  While support within Puerto Rico for statehood referendum was high in 2017 -- 97% voted in favor of statehood -- a turnout rate of just 23% cast doubt on leveraging the support into meaningful action. There is scant recent polling of Puerto Ricans on what they would like to see happen with the island. Officially, Puerto Rico is officially a US commonwealth.  While the island came under US control in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, it wasn't until 1952 that the US and Puerto Rico officially approved a federal law making it a commonwealth.  Because of this, Puerto Ricans do not have a vote in Congress. As US citizens, they can vote in presidential primary elections, but they can't vote in general elections. Calls for Puerto Rico statehood were amplified in 2018  after the island was ravaged by hurricanes. At the time, White House officials told congressional leaders and appropriators that Trump did not want any additional relief funding sent to Puerto Rico,  according to a congressional leadership aide.  ""The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations,"" Trump tweeted in 2018. ""The U.S. will NOT bail out long outstanding & unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money!"" CNN's AJ Willingham and Sarah Westwood contributed to this report.

22,Puerto Rico Governor Vows To Remain In Office After Violent Protests,Reuters,7/16/19,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Tuesday he will stay in office despite protests calling for his resignation that turned violent overnight.A peaceful demonstration that drew thousands to the streets of San Juan on Monday turned hostile in the evening when protesters and police clashed, injuring 21 law enforcement agents, officials said. The unrest was cited by a cruise ship company for its decision to cancel a scheduled stop by one of its vessels in the island’s capital city.The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the U.S.commonwealth’s historic bankruptcy and as its officials seek billions of dollars in funding from the federal government for health care and for recovery efforts following devastating hurricanes in 2017.Protests against Rossello were sparked by leaked controversial and vulgar text messages between the governor and his closest allies and by a federal probe into government corruption on the island.The Trump administration, which has tangled with Rossello in the past, said the events “prove the president’s concerns about mismanagement, politicization, and corruption have been valid,“according to a statement by White House spokesman Judd Deere.Rossello, who took office in 2017, said he respected the right to protest peacefully and vowed to bring greater transparency and accountability to his government.“My commitment is to keep on working and to make sure that services and the transformations that we’ve embarked in Puerto Rico continue,” the governor told a news conference.He added he is in the process of replacing Christian Sobrino, the island’s chief financial officer and Rossello’s representative on Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board, and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Martin, the government’s second in command.The two men, who had participated in the governor’s group chat, resigned on Saturday following the release by Puerto Rico journalist group Centro de Periodismo Investigativo of 889 pages of text messages, showing how Rossello and his closest advisers exchanged memes, comments that were derogatory, misogynistic and homophobic, as well as privileged information in a Telegram group chat.Rossello said on Tuesday he did not commit anything that could be considered illegal or unethical in the chat, but rather”improper” acts.The protests were also sparked by U.S. authorities’ announcement of a federal indictment involving six people, including two former high-ranking Puerto Rico government officials, charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal Medicaid and education funds.Rossello said he welcomed greater federal oversight tied to federal dollars as long as it does not slow down the process.“That should not be a cover for delaying federal funding,“he said.Meanwhile, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said its Empress of the Seas ship was rerouted onTuesday to Tortola in the British Virgin Islands “in light of current unrest in San Juan.”Puerto Rico filed a form of bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.Its oversight board is expected to soon unveil a proposed plan of adjustment for the island’s core government debt.(Reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago.

68,Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló vows he won't resign amid a political scandal. Here's how we got here,Leyla Santiago and Hollie Silverman,7/16/19," Puerto Rico  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló defiantly announced he would not step down Tuesday, hours after police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters calling for his ouster. Protests have been taking place for days following the release of nearly  900 pages from the governor's private group  chat obtained by The Center for Investigative Journalism and published via Telegram. The leaked chats reveal a vengeful approach in running the government, with conversations between Rosselló and his inner circle including homophobic and anti-female sentiments. Rosselló told reporters Tuesday that he will not resign. He also defended the actions of police and accused protestors of unleashing tear gas and setting fires during demonstrations Monday night.   ""I will continue my work and my responsibility to the people of Puerto Rico,"" the embattled governor said at a news conference.  The leaks came the same week two former officials from Rosselló's administration were arrested by the FBI as part of a federal corruption investigation. Now, both civilians and politicians are calling for the governor's resignation, with protesters filling the street in front of the governor's mansion in Old San Juan. Leaked chats with his inner circle Rosselló said that he was the only person on the chats elected by the people of Puerto Rico and that he would work to restore the public's confidence in him.  ""I have not committed any illegal or corrupt acts,"" he said. ""I committed inappropriate acts and have expressed regret for that.""   In one conversation about the management of Puerto Rico's financial crisis, the governor wrote ""Dear Oversight Board, Go F*** Yourself."" Other remarks disparage politicians and journalists.  In one chat, Christian Sobrino Vega, then-Puerto Rico's chief fiscal officer and Roselló's representative on the federal board managing the fiscal crisis, expressed frustration with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and said he wanted to shoot her. ""You'd be doing me a grand favor,"" the governor responded, according to the leaked chats. Politicians call for investigation Even those involved with Roselló are pulling support amid the scandal. Carlos Johnny Méndez, speaker of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives and a member of Rosselló's New Progressive Party, told a local radio show Monday morning that he'd been in touch with the governor and was pulling back his support. ""There are many issues to address, and we cannot have these distractions,"" Méndez said on the show. Puerto Rico Sen. Aníbal José Torres, who chairs the Popular Democratic Party, has called for an investigation, saying he believes the chats contain ethical and criminal violations. Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González, the territory's nonvoting representative in the US Congress, who was also mocked in the group chat, said the governor's apologies are not enough. Some are even planning to take part in the protests. Former New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, whom the governor insulted, has traveled to the island to join protesters in their calls for Rosselló to resign. A stateside protest is planned for Tuesday in Washington, D.C., in front of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration building. The first lady defends her husband Beatriz Rosselló wrote a letter addressing the calls for Rosselló to resign, saying she felt she owed the community an explanation. In the letter she defends her husband, saying that although he has failed, the governor has accepted it with humility and has asked for forgiveness. Rosselló says her husband immediately apologized for his words and she believes he means it. ""He made a mistake, he recognized it, and immediately apologized for it,"" the letter reads. ""We had a conversation about it, I know him well, I recognize his sincerity and therefore I understand his sincerity, and I believe his regret."" The chats use derogatory terms against women, including Mark-Viverito, and homophobic comments about singer Ricky Martin. But the first lady says that Rosselló has respect for women and values family. ""Ricardo, like me, values women, the family, and inclusion,"" she said. ""He was raised to a higher standard with respect."" She says her husband has begun several initiatives during times of adversity that have benefited the territory and that citizens shouldn't lose sight of the changes he's made. ""Ricardo feels a deep love for this land and people,"" Beatriz Rosselló said. ""His mandates have been concentrated on establishment, tranquility and security for our people."" Rosselló says he will not resign The governor said he has much work left to do. ""Despite the difficulties that we have internal and external, the work will continue and the agenda will be completed in all areas, social, educational, safety, health, infrastructure, recovery and everything related to the financial situation that is a high priority among others,"" he said. ""You do not give up on work already started, and today, more than ever, a lot of people are counting on my commitment to do so."" If Rosselló were to resign, the law says the secretary of state, a post that is currently empty, is next in line to take the helm, followed by the island's treasurer.

69,Calls intensify for Puerto Rican governor's resignation following leaked private chats,Leyla Santiago,7/15/19," Calls for Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to resign are growing after remarks he made in a private group chat were leaked, and more protests are being organized in San Juan.  On Sunday, one man yelled over a microphone, ""We will kick you out,"" as other protesters filling the street in front of the governor's mansion in Old San Juan joined him chanting, ""Ricky resign!""  Demonstrators say they feel disrespected and deceived. Many believe the chats indicate corruption and that the governor violated their trust, they say.  The Center for Investigative Journalism published nearly 900 pages from the private group chat via Telegram.  The exchanges between the governor and his inner circle reveal a vengeful approach in running the government -- including attacking journalists by discrediting stories and threatening to turn over political opponents to police.  The remarks also include derogatory terms against women -- notably former New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito -- and homophobic comments targeting singer Ricky Martin. When discussing the federal board responsible for managing Puerto Rico's financial crisis, Rosselló wrote, ""Dear Oversight Board, Go F*** Yourself.""

""You'd be doing me a grand favor,"" the governor responded, according to the leaked chats.  Yulín Cruz belongs to the opposition Popular Democratic Party and is running for governor. Sobrino Vega and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin, who also participated in the chats, have both resigned.  Rosselló said he will not resign.  ""Despite the difficulties that we have internal and external, the work will continue and the agenda will be completed in all areas, social, educational, safety, health, infrastructure, recovery and everything related to the financial situation that is a high priority among others,"" he said.  ""You do not give up on work already started, and today, more than ever, a lot of people are counting on my commitment to do so."" Roselló's office has not responded to a CNN request for an interview.  The leaks came the same week FBI officials arrested two former officials from Rosselló's administration as part of a federal corruption investigation.  Education Secretary Julia Keleher and Angela Avila Marrero, executive director of the island's health insurance administration, had resigned prior to their arrests.  Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González, the American territory's nonvoting representative in the US Congress, who was also mocked in the group chat, said the governor's apologies are not enough. Carlos Johnny Méndez, speaker of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives and a member of Rosselló's New Progressive Party, told a local radio show Monday morning that he'd been in touch with the governor and was pulling back his support.

Aníbal José Torres, who chairs the Popular Democratic Party, has called for an investigation, saying he believes the chats contain ethical and criminal violations. Many on the island are expressing concern over the politics of the scandal jeopardizing relief aid for the most vulnerable people, who are still trying to rebuild their lives nearly two years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.  In April, President Donald Trump called Puerto Rico's politicians ""incompetent or corrupt"" in a tweet. He added, ""Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas & Florida combined, yet their government can't do anything right, the place is a mess."" Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira, who also participated in the chats, told CNN on Sunday that he had no control over Trump's remarks.  ""We understand we have challenges ahead, but we feel we are already working to address them,"" he said.  If Rosselló were to resign, the law says the secretary of state, a post that is currently empty, is next in line to take the helm, followed by the island's treasurer. As for the Puerto Rican diaspora, which includes thousands of people who moved to the States after Hurricane Maria, they are monitoring from afar.  Some, including Mark-Viverito, the ex-New York City Council speaker who the governor insulted, have traveled to the island to join protesters in their calls for the governor to resign.

23,"Ex-Education Secretary, 5 Others Arrested On Fraud Charges In Puerto Rico",AP,7/10/19,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s former secretary of education and five other people were arrested Wednesday on charges of steering federal money to unqualified, politically connected contractors, federal officials said.Federal officials said Wednesday morning that former Education Secretary Julia Keleher; former Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration head Ángela Ávila-Marrero; businessmen Fernando Scherrer-Caillet and Alberto Velázquez-Piñol, and education contractors Glenda E. Ponce-Mendoza and Mayra Ponce-Mendoza, who are sisters, were arrested by the FBI on 32 counts of fraud and related charges.The alleged fraud involves $15.5 million in federal funding between 2017 and 2019. Thirteen million was spent by the Department of Education during Keleher’s time as secretary while $2.5 million was spent by the insurance administration when Ávila was the director.Officials said there was no evidence that Keleher or Ávila-Marrero had personally benefited from the scheme.U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodríguez said Velázquez Piñol had improperly taken advantage of contacts in the education and health insurance agencies to win federal contracts and illegally used federal money to pay for lobbying.Glenda E. Ponce-Mendoza worked as Keleher’s assistant and both she and her sister were friends of the former education secretary. Officials said Keleher bypassed regular bidding procedures to steer contracts toward her friends.“It was alleged that the defendants engaged in a public corruption campaign and profited at the expense of the Puerto Rican citizens and students. This type of corruption is particularly egregious because it not only victimizes tax payers, it victimizes those citizens and students that are in need of educational assistance,” said Neil Sanchez, special agent in charge of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General’s Southern Region.Rodríguez said Gov. Ricardo Rosselló was not involved in the investigation.Rosselló said he was returning early from vacation in Europe to meet with legislators and members of his administration about the investigation.“To maintain the trust of the people in the institutions of the government is a constant challenge that all of us who work in public service have,” he said in a statement. “That trust is torn when public officials or those related, are accused of crimes of corruption.”Multiple Puerto Rican officials over a series of administrations have been hit by charges of corruption and misuse of funds.“It’s a shame that we see this type of scheme, one after another,” Rodríguez said. “There’s much work to be done in Puerto Rico ... this is the type of case that’s been seen so much, involving federal funds, and it’s shameful.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ex-education-secretary-5-others-arrested-in-puerto-rico-probe_n_5d261670e4b0cfb595ff876b,HuffPost,Liberal
70,Washington Post: Puerto Rico might not get $600 million in aid until September despite new law,Faris Bseiso,6/25/19," The  Trump administration has not sent $600 million in emergency food stamp  aid to Puerto Rico  two weeks after President Donald Trump approved the funds , and the US territory does not expect to receive the funding until September,  according to The Washington Post . The anticipated delay would  mark six months after cuts to the food stamp program  began, Glorimar Andújar Matos, executive director of the Departamento de la Familia, told the Post. Around a million people in Puerto Rico are reliant on the food stamp program, according to Matos, and they have seen a decrease in benefits in the months since the cuts began. When states and territories request federal funding from the Food and Nutrition Service, the USDA must first review their plans before approving the fund allocation. In a statement to the Post, a USDA official said that Puerto Rico must propose a plan and then make ""required system changes"" to its local food stamps program. The agency also told the Post that the Puerto Rican government must follow financial management procedures, which it cannot do until Congress approves the funding. However, following Hurricane Maria in 2017, the Puerto Rican government submitted a new plan, according to the Post. In light of the food stamp aid cuts, Matos told the Post that she is waiting to learn from the USDA agency if the Puerto Rican government should send an amended plan or a new one for the additional aid.  ""The Food and Nutrition Service has not yet informed us whether we will be asked to amend,"" Matos said in a statement to the Post. Brooke Hardison, a spokeswoman for the US Department of Agriculture, said Tuesday that officials from the Food and Nutrition Service ""have been actively working with Puerto Rico's Secretary of the Department of the Family to provide technical assistance -- including sending staff to Puerto Rico -- to help them amend their existing disaster plan and ensure that Puerto Rico citizens in need get the additional assistance as soon as possible."" She said the FNS received the plan from Puerto Rico on Monday. ""Prompt implementation of this disaster assistance is a priority for the department, and we are hopeful that funding will be issued in August,"" Hardison said, adding that the temporary disaster funding required is unprecedented and ""cannot be implemented in the same manner"" as a regular nutrition assistance program block grant. But Kevin Concannon, the undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services during the Obama administration, told the Post there should be no reason for the delays. ""It's normally rapidly approved, because you're trying to mitigate the impact of hunger and food insecurity,"" Concannon told the paper. ""This should be straightforward. It should not take this long. The existing program in Puerto Rico has been there for decades, and the infrastructure is used months in and months out."" While lawmakers were considering the emergency funding package, the Trump administration claimed the funding requests for Puerto Rico were  ""excessive and unnecessary"" in a letter to Congress . However, Senate Republicans pressured the administration to include Puerto Rican aid as part of a $19 billion disaster relief package, as they felt it would encourage the Democrat-controlled House to pass the bill, according to the Post.  This story has been updated with additional comment from the US Department of Agriculture.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/politics/emergency-food-stamp-aid-puerto-rico/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjTsfud2cj6AhUBRjABHYd6Ajo4PBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw1K4ECvIxOjndlx6Ecsox-j,CNN,Liberal
24,Ricky Martin Wades Into Religious Liberty Debate In Puerto Rico,Carol Kuruvilla,6/14/19,"Ricky Martinweighed in on the fierce debate inPuerto Rico over a bill allowing government employees to avoid serving certain constituents on religious grounds ― and soon after, the island’s governor decided to kill the measure. The singer, who wasborn in Puerto Rico, published an open letter onThursday denouncing the measure as a “hate bill” that “projects us to the world as a backwards country.” “As a defender of human rights and a member of the LGBTT community, I am vehemently opposed to the proposed measure imposed upon us under the guise of religious freedom,” Martinwrote in a statement on his site.The same day, Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced that he was asking legislators to drop the bill,tweeting in Spanish that “instead of reaching a consensus on a basis of mutual respect, it provokes the division of our people.” Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives approved the measure, known as House Bill 2069, on Tuesday. The legislation would have established “reasonable accommodations” for government employees who do not want to serve certain constituents if they believed it would clash with their religious convictions. Supporters claimed this protected government employees’ religious freedom. Rosselló initially endorsed the bill.LGBTQ activists in Puerto Rico and their allies argued that the bill would give government employees a “license to hate.” Island senator Zoe Laboy promised Thursday to submit a “negative report” about the bill to her colleagues.Three U.S. Democratic presidential candidates — Julián Castro, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — also voiced their disapproval. After hearing that Rosselló had dropped his support for the bill, Martin posted a celebratory statement on his website. “We will never be an accomplice to policies that alienate our community and violate our rights. Authentic religious freedom aims to unite communities of different backgrounds,” he wrote. “We must stay vigilant about assaults on hard-won rights and social gains.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
25,Trump Pits Florida Against Puerto Rico Over Emergency Aid: 'They Don't Like Me',Christopher Mathias,5/8/19,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. ― President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on Puerto Rico at a rally Wednesday, this time pitting his supporters in Florida against the U.S. territory, both of which were destroyed by Category 5 hurricanes.The Trump administration plans to provide 90% of federal emergency cleanup funds to the state of Florida to help with repair after Hurricane Michael struck last October, Trump said at his rally in Panama City Beach, Florida. Aware of complaints about a lack of disaster relief funding, the president blamed Democratic lawmakers and told his supporters, “You’re getting your money one way or the other.”But the president was unable to announce his support for aid in Florida without once again demonizing the island of Puerto Rico, which continues to struggle after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017, causing an estimated 3,000 deaths.Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that Puerto Rico “got $91 billion” in aid after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and complained that the island is asking for more money. He also said Puerto Rico received the largest amount of aid ever distributed, which is also false.“It’s the most money we’ve really given to anybody. We’ve never given $91 billion to a state,” he said. Congress provided about $120 billion in aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, according to the Congressional Research Service, though that storm hit three states.Trump then held up a small piece of paper at the lectern displaying a bar graph meant to show that Puerto Rico received more aid than Florida and Texas. He pointed to the graph and said, “That’s Puerto Rico. They don’t like me.”The president has often repeated the claim that his administration gave Puerto Rico $91 billion in hurricane relief funds. According to The Washington Post, the island has been allocated less than half that amount. About $11.2 billion has been spent so far, and $40.8 billion has been allocated to the island. The $91 billion comes from the allocated amount added to a $50 billion estimate of how much reconstruction will wind up costing over the coming decades.The death toll from Maria is currently about 3,000, a huge jump from original estimates of 64 fatalities, but a Harvard University study said the number is closer to 4,645. Trump has claimed the numbers are fabricated by his political opponents to make him look bad.Meanwhile, residents in Florida are still waiting for Washington to send aid more than 200 days after Michael ripped through the panhandle. More than two dozen people died in the very county where Trump held his rally. According to the Tampa Bay Times, about 5,000 students are homeless, and 1 out of 7 children never returned to school.The president’s supporters in Florida seemed to take his anti-Puerto Rico rhetoric to heart, with some expressing anger over the lack of aid they’ve received.Beth Thompson, a retired Panama City resident who attended the rally with her husband, Ronnie, told HuffPost she resented that “millions of dollars have gone to Puerto Rico” while Florida is “not getting the relief that we need.”“I don’t think it’s Trump’s fault, I think it’s Congress’ fault,” she said. “Because they’re against our president. And they’re doing everything that he doesn’t want to do.”When HuffPost mentioned that Democrats want more money for Puerto Rico, Beth responded, “Why? They obviously haven’t done much with what we’ve given them.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rally-florida-hurricane-puerto-rico_n_5cd35ca0e4b0db2524b58ad1,HuffPost,Liberal
27,Oprah Winfrey To Donate $2 Million To Puerto Rico For Disaster Relief,Mary Papenfuss,4/9/19,"Oprah Winfrey plans to donate $2 million to disaster relief inPuerto Rico, which is still recovering from devastating effects of back-to-back 2017 hurricanes.The media mogul’s donation was announced on Monday by theHispanic Federation and theFlamboyan Arts Fund, which was founded last year by Tony Award-winning actor and “Hamilton” creatorLin-Manuel Miranda and his family. His parents were born in Puerto Rico and he frequently visited his grandparents there.Each organization will receive $1 million for revitalization projects. Winfrey said she was inspired to donate after attendingMiranda’s production of “Hamilton” in San Juanearlier this year. “I was so moved by Lin-Manuel Miranda’s commitment to bring ‘Hamilton’ to Puerto Rico and support the community that served him growing up that I wanted to join in the revitalization efforts of an island so rich in culture, beauty and heritage,” Winfrey said in a statement. “The needs of Puerto Rico and our fellow American citizens following the tragic hurricanes are still very real.”Close to3,000 Puerto Ricans died afterHurricane Maria struck in 2017, just weeks afterHurricane Irma, and residents still face medical aid and food shortages and power outages.Despite these hardships, President Donald Trump has continuously bashed Puerto Rico for seeking resources to recover from the hurricanes. Trump has complained about the costs, using grossly inflated figures, and accused officials of corruption with no evidence:Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has pushed back against the White House, telling CNN in an interview last month that he will not be bullied by the administration or allow the people of Puerto Rico to be treated like “second-class citizens.”“If the bully gets close, I’ll punch the bully in the mouth,” Rosselló said. “It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage.” ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
26,Republicans Attack Puerto Rico’s Plan To Go 100 Percent Renewable: ‘It’s Just Unrealistic’,Alexander C. Kaufman,4/9/19,"Republicans on Tuesday pilloriedPuerto Rico’s plan to stop burning imported fossil fuels to generate electricity, calling the proposal senseless and opening a new front in an increasingly bitter partisan battle over the storm-ravaged island’s struggle to recover.At a House Natural Resources Committee hearing, GOP lawmakers dismissed the Puerto Rican legislature’s vote last month to approve an ambitious bill mandating 100% renewable power by 2050 as “political interference” and accused the territory’s legislators of squandering an opportunity to reap the spoils of the American fracking boom.“It’s just unrealistic,” Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said. “Yet there’s still legislation.”The nine-term congressman, who’sreceived more from the oil and gas industry than any other donor since taking office, last month became the chief antagonist of Democrats’ Green New Deal resolution, which outlines the first climate proposal scientists say is on the scale of what’s needed to combat the global warming crisis. Bishop falsely claimed the Green New Deal banned hamburgers, andperformatively gobbled one at a news conference. Later, he suggested the Green New Deal was tantamount to “genocide.” Yet, on Tuesday, he blamed Puerto Rico lawmakers for playing politics with the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. “PREPA has been hamstrung by political demands,” he said. “One of the problems of PREPA in the past is political interference when your primary goal is [to] provide abundant and affordable energy.”At least 13 states have passed or are considering plans that set 100% clean-electricity targets, according to a report last month by the consultancy EQ Research. But Puerto Rico’s circumstance is unique. In September 2017, hurricanes Irma and Maria shredded the island’s aging electrical grid, leaving millions without power in the second-longest blackout in world history.Puerto Rico imports oil and gas for more than 80% of its electricity needs, saddling ratepayers with prices roughly twice the American average and a toxic legacy of pollution. Renewables made up just 2% of the electricity mix as of two years ago. To some, the disaster, widely seen as a glimpse of what’s to come as climate change worsens, presented an opportunity to equip Puerto Rico to harvest its plentiful sun and wind for power. But Republicans instead proposed a shock-doctrine approach that promised to make Puerto Rico a reliable market for U.S.-produced gas and oil.At a November 2017 hearing before the same committee, Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) asked at the time “which environmental regulation waivers” were required to jump-start efforts to import more natural gas to Puerto Rico. Last July, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) wondered why anyone would consider wind and solar favorable options for Puerto Rico at all. He doubled down on those queries on Tuesday.“They’re intermittent,” McClintock said. “They require reliable generators that are running at ready status so that if a cloud passes over or the wind drops off, they can instantly come on.” It’s an argument President Donald Trump routinely deploys, albeit in less sophisticated terms, to deride renewables. But renewables are typically paired with battery systems that store excess solar or wind power for use when the sky is dark or the air is still. Solar panels paired with batteries provided oases of electricity during Puerto Rico’s monthslong blackout. Indeed, the 100% renewables bill exempts energy storage systems from sales tax and eliminates rules that barred Puerto Ricans from installing battery units without permission from PREPA.Yet batteries barely came up at the hearing, except when one lawmaker pointed out that the technology can be expensive. The hearing came amid a renewed fight over Puerto Rican disaster relief. Trump repeatedly threatened to cut funding to the battered island, which is still struggling to rebuild as federal aid trickles in slowly. Last week, the president falsely claimed Puerto Rico received $91 billion in relief. In reality, of the $41 billion approved to aid Puerto Rico, only about $11 billion has flowed from federal coffers. Another $50 billion is expected to be delivered, but over a period The Associated Press said “could span decades.” The Senate failed last week to advance two separate aid bills as Democrats demanded additional funding for Puerto Rico to which Republican leaders said Trump would never agree. Negotiations broke down Tuesday as Congress headed for a two-week recess.Disaster funding hasn’t halted the natural gas industry’s progress. Last July, the Department of Energy proposed easing shipping rules for liquefied natural gas. By reclassifying tankers as “small scale,” the ships could circumvent more robust federal environmental reviews, according to a report by the watchdog site The Real News.“The finalization of this rule will expedite the permitting of certain small-scale exports of natural gas,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a press release at the time. “The so-called ‘small-scale rule’ will further unleash American energy by reducing the regulatory burden on American businesses while also providing significant benefits to our trading partners in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.”There have been hiccups. In December, Texas-based Excelerate Energy abandoned plans to build a $400 million natural gas terminal on the southern shore of Puerto Rico. But last month, New York-based New Fortress Energy signed a five-year deal with PREPA to supply natural gas to the utility’s power plant in San Juan. On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration published its latest figures showing Puerto Rico’s liquefied natural gas imports bounced back to pre-storm levels as of late 2018. Energy Department electricity chief Bruce Walker, a Trump appointee, testified Tuesday that attempting to rebuild Puerto Rico with non-fossil sources after the storm would have slowed the recovery.“There are some significant engineering concerns,” he said. “It’s not technically possible today to convert that island to 100% renewable.” PREPA CEO José Ortiz Vázquez agreed but said the debate was over how heavily to invest in imported gas to carry the island through to its eventual goal of 100% clean electricity. “Some groups favor going straight up with maximum capacity of renewables and keep burning natural gas to get us through to 2050, while other groups have a different opinion, where we should make a big bet now on natural gas and slowly work on the renewable issue,” he said.Asked how long it would take to convert Puerto Rico’s entire electricity supply, a panel of experts in the second half of the hearing offered answers ranging from “within a decade” to 25 years to “well before the 2050 deadline,” if implemented “under a well-managed, professional system.”There is a real disagreement over the feasibility of going 100% renewable on the national level. A paper published in 2017 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argued a better plan was to aim for 80% renewables by the middle of the century, with nuclear plants and fossil fuel stations equipped with carbon capture and storage technology making up the rest. But studies released in 2015 made the case that the rapid strides in clean energy made it practical and financially sound to completely transition all 50 states and 139 countries to 100% renewable starting immediately. Yet profits are at the heart of Puerto Rico’s dispute. Last year, the Puerto Rican legislature approved a plan to privatize PREPA. It’s a controversial decision that some say will help the bankrupt utility to dig itself out of debt and make the improvements it needs to lower electricity prices. But others fear a PREPA beholden to investors will lock in high rates and transfer control of a public good into the hands of the rich, establishing yet another way the downtrodden U.S. colony generates wealth for those back on the mainland.“It’s not possible for PREPA to immediately convert to 100% renewable energy. There will be a transition period. We recognize that,” said Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who presided over Tuesday’s hearing as committee chairman. “But there are concerns that the current plan to focus on natural gas instead of maximizing and doing promotion around solar generation will lock us into an infrastructure that will soon be dated, an infrastructure that will be dependent on importation. Am I correct?”Marla Pérez Lugo, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, said the question captured “the essence of the problem.” “We’re still thinking that what’s good for PREPA is good for Puerto Rico,” she said. “And that is not necessarily so.” ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
29,"Puerto Rico Governor Reminds Trump, 'We Are Your Citizens'",Amy Russo,4/2/19,"Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló is hitting back at President Donald Trump’s repeated smears of the island as the U.S. territory attempts to continue its recovery from Hurricane Maria and pleads for more federal assistance.“It’s not ‘us’ vs ‘them,’” Rosselló wrote on Twitter Tuesday. “It’s about Americans in need.”The governor was responding to Trump’s claim via a Twitter post that Puerto Rican politicians “complain & ask for more money” while spending it “foolishly or corruptly.”Within his tweet, Trump erroneously stated that Puerto Rico received $91 billion to rebuild from the devastating 2017 hurricane. A Washington Post fact check put the actual figure at just $11.2 billion, speculating that the president was likely referring to a longterm estimate of the funds that may be needed rather than the money that had already been dispersed.Rosselló followed up with a second tweet saying that the residents of Puerto Rico “are wonderful people” and reminding the president, “We are Americans, we are your citizens.”Rosselló, the leader of Puerto Rico’s New Progressive Party, called on senators from both sides of the political aisle to come to an agreement on new funding to help the island’s rebuilding efforts.Legislation stalled on Monday in the Senate over disagreements between the two parties on funneling more federal dollars to Puerto Rico.Trump recently claimed he had “taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever” ― echoing previous self-adulation for his response to the natural disaster and boasting of “a great relationship” with the territory’s residents.But ever since the hurricane’s immediate aftermath, critics have hammered Trump and his administration for responding half-heartedly to the crisis and leaving the island short of the resources it needs to make a full recovery.In February, NBC News spoke with a community leader in central Puerto Rico who reported that throughout the area, roads remained in a dilapidated condition, many homes were still covered in blue tarps and lighting had not yet been fully restored.According to CNN, Rosselló has repeatedly asked for a meeting with Trump to discuss the dire situation, but the president has ignored his request.",[],HuffPost,Liberal

Democrats said the bill did not go far enough to help the U.S. territory in its ongoing recovery effort from the devastation inflicted by 2017′s Hurricane Maria.Trump’s White House has repeatedly been criticized over its mismatched reaction to the hurricane in comparison to the way it has responded to natural disasters that have taken place on the mainland.Twitter users rhetorically asked why Trump had used the quotation marks around the word, as one suggested the president was “charging up the racism” with the post.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
71,House lawmakers push for Puerto Rico statehood amid disaster relief debate,Katie Bernard,3/28/19," The latest effort to make Puerto Rico the 51st state was introduced in Congress on Thursday amid renewed focus on the commonwealth and the US government's response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The Puerto Rico Admission Act of 2019 , which was introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Florida, and Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón, a Republican who represents the island in the House, would grant Puerto Rico equal civil rights and full statehood within 90 days of passage.  ""From the day I was sworn in as Puerto Rico's sole representative in Congress, and filed the Puerto Rico Admission Act, I stated very clearly that I would work different strategies, across all platforms to achieve the full equality for Puerto Rico, which can only be achieved through statehood,"" Gonzalez said in a  news release .  Gonzalez has introduced  similar bills in the past , which failed to gain traction in the House or Senate. The 2019 bill is the first that calls for direct statehood with no referendums or transitional steps, and similar to other efforts, faces heavy headwinds for advancing in Congress. The move comes as  the Republican-controlled Senate considers a new disaster relief package  for the territory and  tensions rise between President Donald Trump and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló , who supports the bill.   ""Puerto Rico's colonial status and unsustainable relationship with the federal government has gone on for over a century, even as our citizens have contributed to the growth, culture and social fabric of the United States, and stood shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens on battlefields around the globe and under our same flag,"" Rossello said in the release.  Puerto Rico renewed its push for statehood last year after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island in 2017. Although the territory is still recovering economically, Trump reportedly told Senate Republicans earlier this week that he questioned the wisdom of sending the island additional disaster relief aid.  In Thursday's news release, Soto referenced disaster relief efforts as a reason to give Puerto Rico statehood.  ""We have seen time and time again that colonial status is simply not working,"" Soto said. ""Look no further than the abysmal Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and the draconian PROMESA law to prove this point all too well."" US Reps. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, both Democrats, as well as Puerto Rico Sen. Carmelo Ríos Santiago also expressed support of the bill in Thursday's release.

31,Trump Absurdly Claims He Has 'Taken Better Care Of Puerto Rico Than Any Man Ever',Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,3/28/19,"PresidentDonald Trump hasonce again congratulated himself forPuerto Rico’s recovery after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017, telling reporters on Thursday he has “taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever.”“Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being, and I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it,” he said outside the White House as he left for a rally in Michigan. He noted that the U.S. government was giving more money to the island than to Texas or to Florida, which also suffered destructive hurricanes.“Frankly, the people of Puerto Rico, I really have a great relationship with them, and I think, when it comes time, they really do appreciate it,” he added.The president also took a dig at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, a frequent Trump critic, saying she “frankly doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He warned her and Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to “spend the money wisely.”The Trump administration has faced repeated criticism for its slow and uneven response to Maria compared to disasters on the mainland. A March 2018 report in Politico showed the administration had by then sent far more support to Texas after Hurricane Harvey than to Puerto Rico after Maria, both in terms of the speed and size of the assistance. Per The Washington Post, the U.S. government is estimated to spend more on Puerto Rico’s recovery over the long term.In his first visit to the island after Maria, Trump notoriously tossed paper towels at survivors, who were in dire need of basic services after the storm wiped out electricity island-wide. During that visit, he also lambasted Puerto Rico for creating a budget strain. “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,” he said.Just this week, NBC News reported that Trump had told Republican legislators at a closed-door meeting that Puerto Rico had received too much money to rebuild after Hurricane Maria.A Washington Post poll from September 2018, a year after the storm, found that the vast majority of Puerto Ricans said they didn’t think Trump had done a good job responding to the hurricane, with 80 percent of Puerto Ricans rating his job as “poor” or “fair,” and only 15 percent as “good,” “very good” or “excellent.”Trump also patted himself on the back for his response to Maria just a month after the devastating storm, giving himself a 10 out of 10 rating in reply to a reporter’s question. At the time, about 80 percent of the island still had no power and 30 percent had no drinking water.Last year, after Rosselló increased the official death count for the hurricane and its aftermath from 64 to nearly 3,000 people following an independent analysis, Trump told reporters: “I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico,” adding that the federal government had “put a lot of money and a lot of effort into Puerto Rico.” ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
30,"Puerto Rico Governor Tells Trump, 'If The Bully Gets Close, I'll Punch The Bully In The Mouth'",Jenna Amatulli,3/28/19,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has pushed back on the White House, telling CNN in an interview that he will not sit back, be bullied by the administration and let the people of Puerto Rico be treated like “second-class citizens.”“I just want to have the opportunity to explain to [President Donald Trump] why the data and information that he’s getting is wrong. I don’t think that getting into a kicking and screaming match with the president does any good. I don’t think anybody can beat the president in a kicking and screaming match. I think that what I am aiming to do is making sure that reason prevails,” said Rosselló told reporter Jim Acosta.Rosselló added, “If the bully gets close, I’ll punch the bully in the mouth. It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage.” His rhetoric comes on the heels of a reportedly tense encounter in which senior White House officials warned representatives for Puerto Rico that they needed to cease pushing so hard to arrange a meeting with Trump. The aim of the requested meeting would be to address the ongoing recovery efforts in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria hit the island in September 2017.Officials for Puerto Rico told CNN that White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, along with other senior officials, said, “Your governor is f***ing things up.” Another official reportedly said, “You guys have to f***ing stop with the meeting request.” The White House has not commented on this exchange.This week, Trump told Republican legislators at a closed-door meeting, “Puerto Rico had gotten too much money to rebuild after Hurricane Maria,” according to NBC News. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was quoted as saying Trump called the amount “way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.”White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere told NBC on Wednesday that Puerto Rico has received tens of billions of dollars in aid and that “the Trump administration will not put taxpayers on the hook to correct a decades-old spending crisis that has left the island with deep-rooted economic problems.”Previously, Trump and Rosselló were on decent terms. The pair met in 2017 to discuss the financial and hurricane recovery plans for the territory. Trump even tweeted about the goodwill between them:Since then, Puerto Rico officials have criticized Trump for not coming through with necessary disaster relief. Tensions have gotten so high that after the meeting this week, Rosselló issued a statement calling out Trump.“The comments attributed to Donald Trump today by senators from his own party are below the dignity of a sitting President of the United States. They continue to lack empathy, are irresponsible, regrettable and, above all, unjustified,” said Rosselló in the statement.“Mr. President: Enough with the insults and demeaning mischaracterizations.

72,Trump again swipes at Puerto Rico in closed door lunch with Republicans,"Phil Mattingly, Manu Raju and Lauren Fox",3/27/19," President Donald Trump, in a closed door meeting Tuesday with Senate Republicans, again took a swipe at Puerto Rico's fiscal management and the size of its disaster relief in the wake of damaging storms last week -- and he brought a visual aid to try and back up his point, according to senators in the room. Trump, as part of broader remarks that touched on everything from special counsel Robert Mueller's report and health care to trade and North Korea, went out of his way to point out the totals of disaster relief aid that has been distributed in the wake of a series of storms and hurricanes in 2017. It is an issue Trump has had for months -- mentioning Puerto Rico's finances and total disaster relief in negative terms repeatedly in meetings with lawmakers and staff as they've worked through iterations of the next disaster relief bill.  ""The point was -- are we spending the money wisely?"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican asked. ""I have nothing against helping the people of Puerto Rico, but we have got to spend the money wisely."" Trump, senators said, then utilized a chart to showed the difference between what Puerto Rico has received compared to other states like Texas and Florida. At one point, Trump noted that Puerto Rico has received more than $90 billion in aid. Congressional officials asked about the total mentioned by Trump that didn't track with what Congress has provided in aid up to this point. ""He just talked about the sum total of it,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told reporters of Trump's Puerto Rico riff. ""I agree that you should always be accounting for how money is spent, but Puerto Rico certainly has needs that were different than some of these other places,"" Rubio added, noting the island had been hit by multiple storms and was already in dire financial straits before that damage occurred. Asked for comment on the senators' description of Trump's remarks, the White House responded in a statement. ""The Trump Administration is committed to the complete recovery of Puerto Rico. The island has received unprecedented support and is on pace to receive tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers. However, the Trump Administration will not put taxpayers on the hook to correct a decades old spending crisis that has left the island with deep-rooted economic problems."" Sen. Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said Trump was ""making the point that Puerto Rico has gotten a lot of money before and a lot of it hadn't been spent wisely, and I think that's a given."" Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló blasted Trump's reported comments in a lengthy statement, saying they ""are below the dignity of a sitting President of the United States. They continue to lack empathy, are irresponsible, regrettable and, above all, unjustified."" He said Puerto Rico has spent disaster aid responsibly and suggested that ""Trump is receiving misleading information from his own staff."" ""I invite the President to stop listening to ignorant and completely wrong advice,"" Rosselló said. ""Instead he should come to Puerto Rico to hear firsthand from the people on the ground. I invite him to put all of the resources at his disposal to help Americans in Puerto Rico, like he did for Texas and Alabama. No more, no less."" The issue of Puerto Rico -- and the President's stated frustration with what the island has received up to this point -- is coming to a head now as lawmakers work to reach a deal on a disaster relief package. Senate Republicans, who unveiled their own $13.4 billion version Tuesday, include $600 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, for the island. The Senate voted Tuesday to begin consideration of the bill.  But the GOP effort falls short of what House Democrats are pushing for regarding aid to Puerto Rico. ""House Democrats oppose this bill because it does not adequately address disaster relief and recovery in Puerto Rico and the territories,"" Evan Hollander, spokesman for House Appropriations Committee, said of the Senate bill. ""If the Senate passes this bill, we will insist on going to conference to ensure that we meet the needs of all Americans."" A spokesperson for Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that the topic of funding for Puerto Rico is an ""ongoing conversation"" between Trump and Scott. ""His view is that we need to get this bill done now since both Florida and Puerto Rico need this funding now,"" spokesman Chris Hartline said. ""The senator is committed to fighting for the people of Puerto Rico in the US Senate. It's why his first floor speech and his first amendment filed was on nutrition assistance funding for Puerto Rico.""

32,An Ancient Ceiba Tree Blooms Once Again After Puerto Rico's Devastating Storms,Alexander C. Kaufman,3/5/19,"VIEQUES, Puerto Rico ― It’s been a year and a half since hurricanes Irma and Maria pummeled this tiny island off Puerto Rico’s eastern coast, and still many homes lay in rubble, electric wires hang precariously from poles and a crippled cargo ferry systemcausesshortages of groceries. The flora, too, bear the scars of the most destructive storms in modern American history.Patches of leafless gray splotch mangroves that once covered nearly half the 52-square-mile island in greenery. Wind-resistant palms, their trunks snapped by fierce gusts, remain permanently hunched.Yet an ancient ceiba tree Viequenses consider sacred is staging a remarkable comeback, one that symbolizes the resilience of the island itself for some residents.Ceiba trees, sometimes called kapok trees in English, dot the island, but there’s only one known asthe ceiba. It’s the island’s oldest tree, estimated to be upward of 400 years old, and stands as Vieques’ third-most popular tourist attraction after a 174-year-old Spanish fort and a bioluminescent bay thatboasts the brightest glowingdinoflagellates in the world.Photographs taken after Hurricane Maria show the tree leafless and badly damaged, with knobby limbs laying broken around its thick trunk. But today, new growth sprouts from its gnarled branches. And last month, pompoms of pink blossoms unfurled for the first time since the hurricanes.“It’s pretty amazing,” Edgar Oscar Ruiz, 34, a local clean-energy activist living on Vieques, said staring up the tree’s trunk.Only a few of the flowers remained during a visit to the island last week. Dried, brown husks of expired blooms littered the ground below, blending with the scattered piles of wild horse dung to create an earthy potpourri. The flowers burst open at dusk, drawing swarms of bees, spiders and hummingbirds to whatArdelle Ferrer Negretti, the founder of a local community project to protect the ceiba, calls “the nectar feast.” When the sunlight fades into blackness, bats join the banquet.The fact that the ceiba blossomed at all this year demonstrates the kind of speedy recovery that’s evaded so much else on this island.Ceiba trees don’t bloom consistently. The pink, lily-like blossoms appear only under the right conditions after the tree absorbs and stores enough energy to produce the bright, sugary flowers.“That this tree is blooming now tells me is it was able to bud leaves after Maria and still get enough energy, and probably had some stored from before,” Fabián Michelangeli, a curator at the New York Botanical Garden’s Institute of Systematic Botany, said by phone. “But that means it’s healthy enough to go for more blooming.” The ceiba is the national tree of Puerto Rico. There is at least one other park venerating a roughly 500-year-old specimen in Ponce, a city on the central southern coast of Puerto Rico’s main island. But, on Vieques, the famed ceiba’s centuries of survival encapsulates the island’s fraught history.The Spanish colonized the island as the English, Danish and other European powers began encroaching westward from their own settlements on the archipelago to the east. While the Puerto Rican mainland developed a peasant farmer economy alongside sugar plantations worked by slaves, Vieques became a giant plantation. When the Spanish finally abolished slavery in the 1870s, the former slaves and newcomers from neighboring islands became sharecroppers, called agregados, who continued to grow and harvest sugar cane. That system remained for decades after the United States conquered Puerto Rico following the 1898 Spanish-American War. In the 1940s, the U.S. Navy decided to build a base on Vieques, evicting agregados from the land they lived on for generations and demolishing their homes, crowding much of the population onto an area in the center of the island. The bulldozers spared the ceiba tree, which sat next to the first checkpoint erected to gate locals off from the third of the island the military now claimed.“Even the Navy understood there was something special about it,” Ruiz said. A protest movement, known among locals as “the struggle,” finally ousted the Navy in 2003. Four years later, Ferrer and others started La Ceiba Community Project to remove trash and debris from the grassy area around the ancient tree. “She brought us all together to restore that space, which is now used by the locals all the time,” Ferrer said. “It’s a symbol of hope that we can continue, that things may get hard but if we stand strong we can make it.” Today, the ceiba is the centerpiece of a 51-acre coastal park where endangered manatees, green turtles and brown pelicans live. On rainy days, water pools in the bowl-shaped crannies between the tree’s twisted limbs, attracting tiny crabs and wild horse, who drink the rainwater.It’s easy to see why ceibas like this one occupy such a unique place in indigenous mythology. In Maya culture, ceiba trees marked the center of the Earth, and the young branches ― covered in spikes like sharpened chainmail ― were believed to serve as a ladder allowing the spirits of the dead to ascend to the afterlife. “It connected multiple worlds in the Maya universe,” said Wayne Elisens, a recently retired botany professor at the University of Oklahoma. “It connected the worlds so souls could climb from this world up to the heavens.” In the religion of the Taíno, Puerto Rico’s indigenous people, the ceiba tree is considered the daughter of YaYa, the all-powerful goddess, Ferrer said. That’s partly why locals ascribe the feminine “la” to the ceiba even though the Spanish word for tree ― “el arbol” ― is masculine. “She’s like the ceiba mother that we all feed from, even the humans, because we feed peace and respect and lightness of the soul,” Ferrer said. “The ceiba has become a source of well-being, good mental health, good family-oriented space that enriches not only people but their families,” she added. “The reflection of all that is how healthy she is, and that she has bloomed again.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vieques-hurricanes-ceiba-tree_n_5c7ea647e4b0e62f69e6e32c,HuffPost,Liberal

73,Warren to visit Puerto Rico as administration considers diverting hurricane funds to border wall,MJ Lee,1/17/19," Sen. Elizabeth Warren is planning to travel to Puerto Rico next week, marking her first visit to the Caribbean island as a presidential hopeful at a moment of heightened political sensitivity around  a Trump administration proposal to divert hurricane relief funding  for the island toward the controversial border wall.  The Massachusetts Democrat, who announced on New Year's Eve that she is exploring a run for president, is scheduled to hold an event in San Juan on Tuesday evening, according to three sources familiar with her planning. The senator's planned trip to Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, comes more than a year after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island. It is still rebuilding after the widespread damage left behind by the hurricane, and the island's requests for additional disaster funding  have become a contentious political issue  in Washington. As Trump continues to insist on funding to build a wall along the southern border, resulting in a weeks-long partial government shutdown, his administration has explored using billions of dollars in unspent Defense Department disaster recovery and military construction funds if the President were to declare a national emergency in order to build the wall,  CNN has reported. A US official told CNN the Pentagon was asked to provide lists of unspent funds, including those earmarked for civil works projects that are part of disaster recovery in Puerto Rico, Texas, California, Florida and elsewhere.  ""Mexico won't pay for @realDonaldTrump's stupid wall, and neither will Congress,"" Warren wrote on Twitter last week in reaction to CNN's reporting. ""So now, he's considering using dollars that were supposed to go to disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, TX, CA & elsewhere to fund his political stunt. Unacceptable."" On Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a veto threat on an appropriations bill, saying in part that Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance Program -- a food stamp program -- was ""excessive and unnecessary."" Since launching her presidential exploratory committee, Warren has traveled to early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire. She last traveled to Puerto Rico around a year ago with other members of the Massachusetts delegation to examine hurricane recovery efforts.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/17/politics/elizabeth-warren-puerto-rico-hurricane-wall-2020/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiE66Dv2sj6AhU1RDABHbkPDHk4UBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw13QMCS5DnxlJ632bQCWkkO,CNN,Liberal
74,'Hamilton' set to premiere in Puerto Rico,Chloe Melas,1/11/19," Lin-Manuel Miranda is bringing his hit musical  ""Hamilton""  to Puerto Rico.  ""Hamilton"" will premiere Friday night at the Centro de Bellas Artes in San Juan.  The musical is set to run for two weeks and will raise money for local arts programs. Miranda, a New York native of Puerto Rican descent, will reprise his role as Alexander Hamilton for the run.

75,"130,000 left Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, Census Bureau says",John D. Sutter,12/19/18," An estimated 130,000 people -- almost 4% of the population -- left the island of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, according to data released Wednesday by the US Census Bureau. ""It's a really large number -- and it's a number that's well above what we've seen in the past,"" Alexis Santos, a demographer at Penn State University, said of the population decrease. ""Here, what you're looking at is double -- double the displacement we would have expected"" in a normal year.  The population of the US territory has long been falling and now sits at about 3.2 million. Amid a debt crisis and other problems, more than 530,000 people have left Puerto Rico since 2010, the agency says. The population estimates are considered the most authoritative look yet at the ""exodus"" of people from the Caribbean island amid monthslong power outages and other chaotic conditions that  proved deadly for thousands of people . The US Census Bureau data looks at the population change from July 1, 2017, before Hurricane Maria, and the same date in 2018. The figures are estimates from government records and are published annually, the Census Bureau said. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. The federal response has been described as both slow and inadequate.  CNN published some of the first figures showing the shape of the out-migration . Data obtained through public records requests showed that Puerto Ricans appeared to have moved to every US state in the months after the storm. Florida was the top state for migrants leaving Puerto Rico; Orlando was the top metro area, according to the CNN analysis.  Other researchers used net airline passenger data and other methods to try to estimate the scope of the movement of people. The census figures were released as part of its annual population estimates.

76,Trump does not want more relief funding sent to Puerto Rico,Sarah Westwood and Elizabeth Landers,11/12/18," White House officials have told congressional leaders and appropriators that President Donald Trump does not want any additional relief funding sent to Puerto Rico, a congressional leadership aide told CNN on Monday.   While there are no talks to cut funds that have already been appropriated, a White House aide said negotiations have focused on keeping Puerto Rico relief funding out of a supplemental spending bill that would fund relief efforts in parts of the south that were ravaged by hurricanes this year. That aide noted Puerto Rican officials haven't yet spent all the money Congress has set aside for them, and said the administration is moving to stop any more money from going to help the island ""because they don't need it and will most likely not be able to spend it."" Trump's latest positioning on Puerto Rico was first  reported by Axios . The White House has been making this known on Capitol Hill for ""a while now,"" the congressional leadership aide said. Trump  has previously taken aim at Puerto Rican officials  for their management of the billions in relief funds his administration has appropriated for storm recovery, accusing the island's leaders of spending some of that money for reasons other than hurricane clean-up. ""The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations,"" Trump  tweeted on October 23 . ""The U.S. will NOT bail out long outstanding & unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money!""  More than a month earlier, the President had repeatedly dismissed a widely cited death toll that placed the number of lives lost in Hurricanes Irma and Maria around 3,000  by claiming Democrats had exploited the numbers to make his administration look bad . There has been no evidence to indicate that partisan politics has played a role in the calculation of the death tally, and George Washington University, which conducted the study to calculate the death toll, released a statement at the time that said it stands by its work. Talks over stopping future funding for Puerto Rico come as lawmakers look to avoid a government shutdown when temporary spending bills expire in early December. The funding fight could be the last of Trump's presidency waged by a Republican-controlled Congress, as Democrats have an incoming majority in the House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello could also not be reached for comment. In October, the government of Puerto Rico rolled out a five-year economic blueprint that included $82 billion in federal hurricane recovery relief. The plan was approved by a federal control board, which oversees the island's finances. The board's executive director Natalie Jaresko said at the time the funds would not be budgeted for debt payments, but rather to help stimulate the economy. In February, Puerto Rico received $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster relief package signed by Trump. The funding for the devastated island was part of a $90 billion package agreed upon by Senate leaders as part a two-year budget deal to avert a government shutdown. The relief deal covered a number of major disasters across the US, including Hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, and wildfires in California. Puerto Rico had estimated it would need $94 billion to rebuild the devastated island after two destructive hurricanes hit, shredding its power grid and infrastructure.

34,"Trump, Without Evidence, Accuses Puerto Rico Of Abusing Hurricane Relief Funds",Sara Boboltz,10/23/18,"President Donald Trump has yet to run out of criticism for Puerto Rico and its government officials, 13 months after Hurricane Maria’s devastation. The president on Tuesday accused the island territory’s leaders of using federal relief funds to pay off “other obligations,” without evidence. “The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful the but inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations,” Trump said via Twitter.“The U.S. will NOT bail out long outstanding & unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money!” he continued. The president did not specify where he believed the funds were going, but appeared to be referring to the island’s longstanding financial crisis. Puerto Rico’s debt problems preceded last year’s deadly Hurricane Maria, which claimed nearly 3,000 lives, and has been the president’s scapegoat for incomplete recovery efforts.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has frequently tangled with Trump since Maria, wasted no time responding to the smear. Within the hour, Cruz tweeted that none of the relief funds will be used to pay back creditors, which include American hedge funds.“We finally AGREE on something,” Cruz told Trump.It was unclear where Trump got the idea that Puerto Rican officials were attempting to alleviate the island’s $70 billion debt with federal relief money. Trump in mid-September tweeted a quote from Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, in which Dobbs lauded the Trump administration’s efforts to rebuild Puerto Rico and said the island had “one of the most corrupt governments in our country.” Last week, FBI agents raided a San Juan municipal building in an investigation into government contractors.In July, three current and former government officials were arrested on corruption charges, accused of using $5 million in federal funds to pay employees’ salaries well before Hurricane Maria, between 2013 and 2016.Trump has a long history of feuding with Puerto Rican officials, especially Cruz, beginning with Hurricane Maria’s September 2017 landfall. Last month, after Trump flatly denied the storm’s new official death toll ― increased in August from 64 to 2,975 ― Cruz slammed his “appalling” lack of respect for the dead.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
36,"In Puerto Rico, Patients Are Still Waiting For A Dialysis Clinic That May Never Come",Carolina Moreno,10/16/18,"VIEQUES, Puerto Rico ― As the sun began to set on this small isolated island offPuerto Rico’s eastern coast, Sandra Medina de Jesús lay quietly on a hospital stretcher in her house. The 42-year-old mother, bedridden because of an ulcer in her tailbone, had just returned from one of the three 11-hour journeys she makes weekly to receive dialysis on the main island.“Today was one of my low days,” she told HuffPost between labored breaths. “I was feeling very unmotivated, very down. I didn’t want to go but I knew that I had to go.”Shortly after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in September 2017, Medina de Jesús began to develop complications from the diabetes she’d lived with for much of her life. Ultimately, she lost the bottom half of her left leg and began to suffer from chronic kidney failure.“This fight hasn’t been easy,” said Medina de Jesús, whose colorful personality and wit earned her the nickname ‘Lady Gaga’ among her friends. “I’ve fallen many times, but my son and my husband give me the strength to keep going.”Dialysis, a treatment for kidney failure, removes toxic substances and waste produced by the metabolic system from patients’ bodies. The hemodialysis machine that filters patients’ blood and returns it to them requires a consistent power supply, a water treatment plant, several gallons of potable water and trained personnel, among other things. Without dialysis treatments, patients like Medina de Jesús would die.“If a patient skips a treatment, these substances will build up and cause harm,” Dr. José Ayala, a nephrologist in Puerto Rico, told HuffPost. For the 10 dialysis patients in Vieques, including Medina de Jesús, receiving treatment on their home island became impossible after Maria. The dialysis center at the nearby Susana Centeno Hospital, known as the Diagnostic and Treatment Center, closed after parts of the hospital building suffered damage in the storm.Consequently, patients on Vieques, many of them fragile, have to travel more than 25 miles by land and air to the Fresenius Kidney Care Center in Humacao, Puerto Rico for treatment.In the past year, Puerto Rico’s Department of Health has repeatedly promised Vieques patients a temporary solution in the form of a mobile dialysis clinic ― but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, a permanent solution is nowhere in sight as politicians and government agencies pawn off responsibility for rehabilitating or replacing Vieques’ hospital.Five patients have died during this monthslong wait for local dialysis treatment, according to the nonprofit Renal Council of Puerto Rico. Though their deaths were not directly related to kidney failure, advocates say the grueling journey to get life-saving dialysis treatment deteriorates patients’ health and complicates their other chronic conditions, like hypertension, diabetes and cancer.Dialysis treatment is usually done three days a week ― for Medina de Jesús, it’s every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. When HuffPost visited, Medina de Jesús and her husband had woken up before sunrise so he could bathe her, dress her and pack her bag in time for an ambulance to pick her up at 7:30 a.m. The ambulance was 30 minutes late and broke down, which meant she had to wait for a second ambulance to finish her transport to the airport. Once there, Medina de Jesús waited as airport staff took seats out of a small eight-seat aircraft to make room for her stretcher.The flight to the mainland is less than 10 minutes long, but Medina de Jesús and her sister ― who usually accompanies her ― say it can be nerve-wracking.“A few days ago, my sister and I had a big scare,” Medina de Jesús said. “The plane dropped a lot, almost like it was going to crash, and I looked at her and grabbed her and said: ‘Oh my God, we’re both going to die here.’”Typically, after the plane arrives at the José Aponte de la Torre Airport in Ceiba, Medina de Jesús is again transferred to an ambulance and driven 30 minutes to the dialysis center in the Humacao municipality. If all goes well, she arrives just before 9:30 a.m. and is immediately wheeled in for her nearly four-hour treatment.Inside the icy dialysis center, about two dozen mauve chairs are lined up in rows next to their corresponding hemodialysis machines. Amid the beeping of the machines, you can hear the heavy groans of patients suffering from pain. Some patients try to sleep during treatment, but Leyla Rivera Acosta prefers to watch the telenovela “Rubí” on her phone.After she’s disconnected, the 45-year-old Vieques patient sits on a bench outside the Fresenius Kidney Care Center. She shakes her leg, body tense as she waits for the van that will transfer her and others back to the Ceiba airport to finish the day-long journey. It will still be almost four hours before she arrives home.“I’m tired,” Rivera Acosta told HuffPost with a sigh. “I can’t wait to get home. This isn’t easy, to be traveling like this three times a week ― and I’m young. I still have my strength, but this weakens you little by little.”She had a slight headache but insisted it was manageable compared to other days. Despite being one of the younger and more stable dialysis patients from Vieques, Rivera Acosta said she sometimes comes out of treatment feeling very sick. The dialysis process can bring about uncomfortable symptoms, including low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramping.“It’s a sensation that makes you feel like dying,” said Rivera Acosta, who has needed dialysis treatment since her hypertension caused her kidneys to fail five years ago. The “cramps start at the stomach and then keep going up and then go down towards my thighs, my legs, it’s horrible. I’m in tears.”“There are days when I’ve gotten home and I can’t help my kids,” the mother of two added. “I can’t even take a shower, I just take off my clothes and lie down because I feel so terrible I can’t do anything.”Like Medina de Jesús, Rivera Acosta has been traveling to the main island for treatment every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday for more than a year now ― which means she’s been missing two days of work per week at Vieques’ Municipal Revenue Collection Center.Rivera Acosta said she’s only been able to cash in a full-time paycheck thanks to her co-workers, who’ve gifted her their sick and vacations days. The heavy travel schedule is also affecting her ability to tend to her children, particularly her 13-year-old son Jouseph, who has autism.“When the treatment was in Vieques, it was a lot easier because I could keep my normal daily routine,” she said. “I woke up, took care of my kids, went to work, and if I had anything to do, I could do it. I would get the dialysis treatment at four in the afternoon and was back at home by 7:30 p.m. It was just those three and a half hours in the center, that’s it. Now, it’s all day, a whole day here on the main island to get my dialysis treatment.”Both Rivera Acosta and Medina de Jesús said the situation has robbed them of a better quality of life. Nephrologists and advocates agree, but there is little the mothers can do, especially since moving to the main island isn’t a viable option for their families.Medina de Jesús said her husband, who is her primary caretaker, doesn’t want to leave Vieques; Rivera Acosta said it’d be hard for her to find a stable full-time job that would be flexible with her condition, particularly with Puerto Rico’s economic crisis. She’s also afraid Jouseph would be bullied at a new school.“Bullying in Puerto Rico is terrible, and at least in Vieques, his classmates know him, he isn’t bullied and they treat him very well, they treat him like a normal kid,” she said.Ayala, who has treated Medina de Jesús and other Vieques patients at the Humacao dialysis center post-Maria, told HuffPost the full days of travel are difficult for all Vieques patients. At one point or another, Ayala said, nearly all of them have had to be transferred to a nearby hospital after treatment because of health complications that prevented them from traveling home.It’s a precarious situation the nephrologist feels is unacceptable: “Establishing a dialysis unit in an emergency situation like this should not take this much time,” he said. Private flights are just the latest in a series of stopgap measures intended to facilitate dialysis treatment for patients in Vieques after Hurricane Maria. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency flew patients to San Juan by helicopter for treatment. Then nonprofits like ViequesLove and Americares began to pay for charter planes. ViequesLove did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries, but an account it gave The Atlantic indicates the organization began funding the flights in late October. Americares told HuffPost it funded transportation for dialysis patients in Vieques from late November 2017 through the end of this February.For a while, with no one to pick up the tab, Vieques patients had to make the trip to the main island by ferry ― a notoriously unreliable, strenuous and crowded form of transportation.The Renal Council of Puerto Rico, a nonprofit organization that advocates for kidney patients, has been funding the flights since April. Director Ángela Díaz told HuffPost the organization has spent more than $161,000 covering the weekly flights for nine patients in Vieques, the paramedics who travel with them, and daily food. Transportation to and from the airports is either covered by the patients’ medical insurance or with the help of local hospitals.Medina de Jesús is an exception. Her condition makes it impossible for her to travel by plane with other patients, and Díaz said the Renal Council could not afford to cover her costs. The municipality of Vieques pays for her flights instead but doesn’t cover a paramedic to fly with her. “I go in a plane alone, with the pilot and my sister. No paramedic,” Medina de Jesús said. “If something happens to me, neither the pilot nor my sister will be able to help me because they don’t know what to do.”But the Renal Council is very close to running out of money, Díaz said, disrupting even this imperfect arrangement. The organization will only fund the flights until the end of October; then the Department of Health will either have to pick up the tab or get a functioning mobile dialysis unit on the small island. Yolanda Huertas, assistant secretary of medical and nursing services at the Department of Health, told HuffPost that FEMA gave Puerto Rico’s Department of Health $2.9 million to purchase a mobile dialysis clinic for Vieques. FEMA also confirmed via email that it had given the department funds for the unit.The Department of Health first promised the mobile dialysis clinic would arrive by July. When that didn’t happen, it moved the date to the end of August.A delay in the arrival of the machinery’s warranty paperwork caused the setback, Huertas told HuffPost.On Oct. 5, the Department of Health sent letters to Vieques dialysis patients notifying them that the mobile unit had arrived in Vieques and was being prepared for use by personnel from Odulair, a Wyoming-based manufacturer of mobile health clinics. The letter, signed by Puerto Rico Secretary of Health Rafael Rodríguez Mercado, said the mobile dialysis unit would hopefully be ready for use by or before the end of October. As of Tuesday morning, the mobile dialysis is still not up and running on Vieques.The continuous delays have left Rivera Acosta skeptical about whether a functioning mobile dialysis unit will ever be available on Vieques.“I feel like they have deceived us, and I have a feeling that they keep stalling and they are actually never going to set up a clinic,” she said, later adding. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”Even once the mobile unit begins operating, it would only be another temporary solution for dialysis patients in Vieques. The Renal Council pointed out that Department of Health regulations don’t allow a mobile dialysis unit to be used for more than eight months at a time.“We need a permanent center with the necessary security measures as well as proper water and power supply,” Ayala said. “A mobile station provides a temporary relief for the situation but it is not something permanent.” Dr. Rodolfo Troche, a San Juan-based nephrologist who served as medical director for the Vieques dialysis center from its inception in 2008 to 2010, agreed the mobile unit should not be a permanent solution.“I don’t know how strong it will be or how prepared it is to tolerate the kind of phenomenon that we just experienced,” he said, referencing Hurricane Maria. “If any other weather situation occurs, we will be back to zero.”And the need for a permanent dialysis center on Vieques will likely only grow over time. Ayala and Troche said Puerto Rico has a high incidence of people with underlying conditions that lead to kidney failure ― including diabetes, hypertension and urinary tract infections.To make matters worse, a lack of specialized providers and access to care means patients with these conditions don’t have the tools to effectively manage their chronic conditions and prevent kidney damage. “Theoretically, the most effective thing to do would be to treat the conditions that cause kidney failure, and that doesn’t seem to be happening,” Ayala said, adding that diabetes is by far the most common condition leading to dialysis in the U.S. territory. But “there are very few endocrinologists available to help with the treatment of diabetes because there are very few endocrinologists in Puerto Rico.”“We have a shortage of medical professionals,” he added. “Specialists are leaving the island due to the [economic] conditions that we live in here.”While dialysis patients wait for a more permanent solution, both Ayala and Troche agree that it would be cheaper to build a new dialysis center in Vieques than to keep paying for patients to fly between their home island and the main island for treatment.“Establishing the dialysis center in Vieques would be more cost-effective than to have to keep traveling,” Troche said. “That was the reason they [built the center in Vieques] 10 years ago. The Department of Health noticed that they were spending a lot of money paying for travel.”In the meantime, patients in Vieques are desperate for a functioning mobile dialysis unit on their island. “Some walk and others don’t, but we all get tired,” Medina de Jesús said. “Vieques is a tough little island, and I know we can do this. What happens is that I don’t think they want to fight anymore.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-patients-dialysis-clinic-hurricane-maria_n_5bc11ddde4b0bd9ed55a4cbb,HuffPost,Liberal

As of Tuesday morning, the mobile dialysis is still not up and running on Vieques.The continuous delays have left Rivera Acosta skeptical about whether a functioning mobile dialysis unit will ever be available on Vieques.“I feel like they have deceived us, and I have a feeling that they keep stalling and they are actually never going to set up a clinic,” she said, later adding. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”Even once the mobile unit begins operating, it would only be another temporary solution for dialysis patients in Vieques. The Renal Council pointed out that Department of Health regulations don’t allow a mobile dialysis unit to be used for more than eight months at a time.“We need a permanent center with the necessary security measures as well as proper water and power supply,” Ayala said. “A mobile station provides a temporary relief for the situation but it is not something permanent.” Dr. Rodolfo Troche, a San Juan-based nephrologist who served as medical director for the Vieques dialysis center from its inception in 2008 to 2010, agreed the mobile unit should not be a permanent solution.“I don’t know how strong it will be or how prepared it is to tolerate the kind of phenomenon that we just experienced,” he said, referencing Hurricane Maria. “If any other weather situation occurs, we will be back to zero.”And the need for a permanent dialysis center on Vieques will likely only grow over time. Ayala and Troche said Puerto Rico has a high incidence of people with underlying conditions that lead to kidney failure ― including diabetes, hypertension and urinary tract infections.To make matters worse, a lack of specialized providers and access to care means patients with these conditions don’t have the tools to effectively manage their chronic conditions and prevent kidney damage. “Theoretically, the most effective thing to do would be to treat the conditions that cause kidney failure, and that doesn’t seem to be happening,” Ayala said, adding that diabetes is by far the most common condition leading to dialysis in the U.S. territory. But “there are very few endocrinologists available to help with the treatment of diabetes because there are very few endocrinologists in Puerto Rico.”“We have a shortage of medical professionals,” he added. “Specialists are leaving the island due to the [economic] conditions that we live in here.”While dialysis patients wait for a more permanent solution, both Ayala and Troche agree that it would be cheaper to build a new dialysis center in Vieques than to keep paying for patients to fly between their home island and the main island for treatment.“Establishing the dialysis center in Vieques would be more cost-effective than to have to keep traveling,” Troche said. “That was the reason they [built the center in Vieques] 10 years ago. The Department of Health noticed that they were spending a lot of money paying for travel.”In the meantime, patients in Vieques are desperate for a functioning mobile dialysis unit on their island. “Some walk and others don’t, but we all get tired,” Medina de Jesús said. “Vieques is a tough little island, and I know we can do this. What happens is that I don’t think they want to fight anymore.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
77,"20,000 pallets of bottled water left untouched in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico",Bill Weir,9/20/18," The stockpile of bottled water stretches down an unused runway in Ceiba. Case after case, pallet piled upon pallet, blue tarps and plastic glinting in the sun.  The emergency supplies were brought in by FEMA in the aftermath of  Hurricane Maria , which smashed the island and left its residents without power, without roofs and without running water.  Federal officials commandeered the area in the far east of the island last fall as a staging ground, collecting the water and containers full of tarps to patch damaged and destroyed roofs in surrounding neighborhoods.  And there the supplies sat. And sat. Storm survivors were collecting spring water from the mountains for cooking and bathing,  even with the threat of disease that brought .  And apparently, the supplies were just left there, lost perhaps in poor communication and collaboration.  FEMA handles getting the supplies to the state or commonwealth, who in turn handle distributing those items at a local level, said Jeff Byard, FEMA Associate Administrator for Response and Recovery. ""Obviously with Maria, we had not a supply issue, we had distribution issues,"" he said during a briefing about Hurricane Florence.  Ottmar Chavez, now administrator of Puerto Rico's General Services Administration, said FEMA reported that it had about 20,000 pallets of bottled water in excess in May this year, before Chavez was appointed.  His agency claimed the water, intending to deliver it where it was needed.  But after about 700 pallets had been distributed, complaints began to come in about the water's foul smell and taste, Chavez said in a statement.  ""In light of this, we have been in contact with FEMA and the Department of Health to test the water inventory received by the federal agency. We are going to return those waters,"" he said.  The mayor of Ceiba, Angel Cruz Ramos, told CNN he's grateful for the generosity, but believes that too much water was delivered at the wrong time. ""The time and heat has made it bad,"" he added.  CBS News  first reported the water stockpile  on Tuesday, the same day  President Trump  said his administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico was  ""an incredible, unsung success.""

78,"Puerto Rico gov: No doubt nearly 3,000 died due to Maria",Rachel Ventresca,9/20/18," The governor of Puerto Rico said Thursday there is no doubt that there were nearly 3,000 deaths as a result of Hurricane Maria, disputing President Donald Trump's assertion that the figure was artificially inflated. ""I evaluated everything they did, and it is my view that it was a very well-done estimate of the death toll numbers,"" Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN's Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto on ""CNN Newsroom."" In August , researchers at George Washington University published a report estimating nearly 2,975 people died between September 2017 and February 2018 as a result of the storm. CNN's own reporting reflects similar numbers.  The new figure marked a sharp escalation from numbers released by the Puerto Rican government in December 2017, which said 64 people had died due to the storm. Last week, Trump disputed the new estimate, tweeting, ""When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000 ..."" Trump also alleged the figure was raised by Democrats ""in order to make me look as bad as possible.""  There has been no evidence to indicate that partisan politics has played a role in the calculation of the death tally, and George Washington University released a statement saying it stood by its work. Rosselló, who has been reluctant to contradict the President in the past over his handling of the hurricane, previously disputed Trump's statement on the revised death toll,  telling CBS News , ""Neither the people of Puerto Rico nor the victims deserve their pain to be questioned.""",https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/politics/ricardo-rossello-puerto-rico-death-toll-cnntv/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi0qOrB3Mj6AhU6ZjABHRp2ATA4ZBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2bHCH5Z7Jl5pJfFb34Zb5t,CNN,Liberal
79,Puerto Rico governor: 'We need to solve the century-old problem of colonialism',Clare Foran,9/16/18," Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló argued Saturday that residents of the US territory are treated like ""second-class citizens"" and said ""we need to solve the century-old problem of colonialism in Puerto Rico.""  In addition to calling for more resources to help rebuild after Hurricane Maria, the governor told CNN's S.E. Cupp, ""there's another thing we need: We need to solve the century-old problem of colonialism in Puerto Rico. The truth of the matter is ... we are treated as second-class citizens.""  During an interview on ""S.E. Cupp Unfiltered,"" Rosselló, a member of the New Progressive Party, which seeks Puerto Rico statehood, said that all US lawmakers should be able to answer the question, ""Do you support the notion that the United States, being the standard-bearer of democracy, should have more than 3 million of its citizens disenfranchised from voting or having representation?"" As  a US territory , Puerto Rico does not have statehood status, although its residents are American citizens. As residents of a territory rather than a state, Puerto Ricans can't vote for president in the US general election. The territory has a nonvoting delegate in Congress, called a resident commissioner. Rosselló defended the accuracy of  the death toll  of nearly 3,000 residents that was associated with Hurricane Maria by researchers and adopted by the Puerto Rico government as the official death count, but which President Donald Trump  has falsely claimed  is not accurate.  ""I reject the notion that this is somehow a conspiracy or that it is not true. It is the most scientifically accurate estimate that we have from what happened here in Puerto Rico,"" the governor said.   CNN's Darran Simon contributed to this report.

80,"Trump falsely claims nearly 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico 'did not die'",Betsy Klein and Maegan Vazquez,9/14/18," Nearly 3,000 people died in the aftermath  of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. President Donald Trump denied this reality as a hurricane barrels toward the Carolinas. ""3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000,"" he said in a  tweet Thursday morning  as Carolinians prepared to be pummeled by Hurricane Florence.  After Trump received backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers over this false claim, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley released a statement Thursday that said, ""As the President said, every death from Hurricane Maria is a horror. Before, during, and after the two massive hurricanes, the President directed the entire Administration to provide unprecedented support to Puerto Rico."" ""President Trump was responding to the liberal media and the San Juan Mayor who sadly, have tried to exploit the devastation by pushing out a constant stream of misinformation and false accusations,"" the statement read. Earlier this month, the island's governor formally raised the death toll from Hurricane Maria to an estimated 2,975 from 64 following a study conducted by researchers at The George Washington University. CNN's own reporting reflects similar numbers. The university study accounted for Puerto Ricans who succumbed to the stifling heat and other aftereffects of the storm and had not been previously counted in official figures. Much of the  US territory was without power for weeks.  Top Republicans broke from Trump's assessment. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters he has ""no reason to dispute those numbers."" ""Casualties don't make a person look bad, so I have no reason to dispute these numbers,"" he said Thursday. ""It was devastating. It was a horrible storm. I toured the entire island. It's an isolated island that lost its infrastructure and power for a long time, you couldn't get to people for a long time,"" Ryan said.  ""I have no reason to dispute those numbers,"" he added. ""Those are just the facts of what happened."" Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is locked in a tight Senate race, also split from Trump. ""I disagree with @POTUS-- an independent study said thousands were lost and Gov. Rosselló agreed. I've been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic; the extent of lives lost as a result of Maria is heart wrenching. I'll continue to help PR,"" he tweeted. Trump has consistently denied any fault for his administration in the aftermath of the storm. In fact, the President has instead sought praise for his handling of Hurricane Maria, saying earlier this week that it was ""an incredible, unsung success."" Seeking praise His comments run counter to how many locals and experts have assessed the federal government's response. ""I think Puerto Rico was incredibly successful,"" Trump said Tuesday in the Oval Office, noting that the island location is ""tough"" during a hurricane due to the inability to transport vital equipment and supplies by truck. ""It was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about."" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, a vocal critic of the administration's handling of the storm, has cast blame on the federal government for failing to provide adequate assistance in the aftermath of the storm, and she slammed Trump's assertion Tuesday. ""In a humanitarian crisis, you should not be grading yourself. You should not be just having a parade of self-accolades. You should never be content with everything we did. I'm not content with everything I did, I should have done more. We should all have done more,"" Cruz told CNN's Anderson Cooper later Tuesday evening. ""But the President continues to refuse to acknowledge his responsibility, and the problem is that if he didn't acknowledge it in Puerto Rico, God bless the people of South Carolina and the people of North Carolina,"" Cruz said. Trump administration officials admit fault While the President has frequently praised the government response in the year since the hurricane, others in the administration have acknowledged learned lessons. Earlier this month,  the Government Accountability Office released a report  that revealed FEMA had been so overwhelmed with storms by the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico that more than half of the  workers it was deploying to disasters were known to be unqualified for the jobs  they were doing in the field.  And FEMA Administrator Brock Long has said FEMA made changes to some of its priorities and procedures. ""We made a lot of changes in real time in addition to the high-level efforts that we learned through our after-action process. Bottom line is, we are concentrating on what we call critical lifelines -- health, safety, security. You know, we've got food, shelter, health and medical, power and fuel, communications, transportation, hazardous waste,"" he told reporters on a conference call on Hurricane Lane preparations last month. ""We are hyper-focused on those seven critical lifelines because we realized last year that if any one of those lifelines goes down, then life safety is in jeopardy. And so, we're reorganizing the firepower of the federal government underneath these critical lifelines, we're pushing forward,"" Long added. Trump also alleges partisan ploy In a second tweet Thursday, Trump cast blame on Democrats, who he said are trying to make him look bad. ""This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!"" he wrote. The death toll study was commissioned by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, a member of Puerto Rico's ""New Progressive Party."" It was conducted by the nonpartisan George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health. There has been no evidence to indicate that partisan politics has played a role in the calculation of the death tally, and George Washington University released a statement Thursday that said it stands by its work.  Rosselló told CNN on Thursday that the Puerto Rican government is ""confident"" in the results of the study and that he has no reason to believe the estimate was part of an effort by Democrats to undermine the President.  ""There's no reason to doubt the validity of these studies, no reason to expect -- even though it's an estimate -- that it's not far away from what the accurate toll should be,"" Rosselló said.  He also said that ""the victims nor the people of Puerto Rico deserve to have their pain questioned.""  ""The moment is not to have political bickering or to argue about other things that are not important, but rather to focus on the pain and remember those who lost their lives and focus on rebuilding the future,"" the governor added.  The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for clarification on Trump's claim of the billions of dollars raised. CNN's Kevin Liptak, Jeremy Diamond, Natalie Gallon, Ashley Killough and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/13/politics/trump-puerto-rico-death-toll/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiD2rWx6cj6AhW2RzABHStdD5g45gEQFnoECAEQAg&usg=AOvVaw01aF5YPliPykVY9uj2u4_q,CNN,Liberal
81,"Trump touts Puerto Rico response as 'fantastic' despite nearly 3,000 dead",Kevin Liptak and Jeremy Diamond,9/3/18," President Donald Trump, facing a drastically revised death toll in Puerto Rico a year after dual hurricanes devastated the island,  offered a still-rosy outlook of his administration's handling of the disaster  on Wednesday.  ""I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico,"" Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta during an exchange with reporters at the White House. ""We're still helping Puerto Rico."" It was an optimistic accounting of his administration's handling of the natural disaster, which left much of the US territory without power for weeks and resulted in thousands of deaths. The island's governor formally raised the death toll from 64 to 2,975 on Tuesday  following a study conducted by researchers at George Washington University . The study accounted for Puerto Ricans who succumbed to the stifling heat and other after-effects of the storm and were not previously counted in official figures. Trump has trumpeted his handling of the storm's aftermath, including saying in the days afterward the storm had resulted in a relatively small number of deaths compared to a ""real catastrophe like Katrina."" Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana in 2005, killed roughly 1,200. He also awarded himself a ""10 out of 10"" on disaster recovery efforts during an Oval Office meeting last year with Puerto Rico's governor. ""Did we do a great job?"" he asked his guest. Through it all, Trump has maintained that Puerto Rico's languishing infrastructure and geography hampered efforts. He said on Wednesday an outdated electric grid and the territory's status as an island continued to the difficulty. ""Puerto Rico was actually more difficult because of the fact it was an island,"" he said. ""It's much harder to get things on the island."" Trump has come under stiff criticism for his handling of the disaster,  principally from Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico's capital city San Juan . ""The administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect. The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us,"" Yulín Cruz said on CNN Wednesday, later adding, ""Shame on President Trump. Shame on President Trump for not even once, not even yesterday, just saying, 'Look, I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico.'""  Trump did not respond directly to his critics Wednesday, instead saying he hoped the island doesn't suffer a similar fate this year. ""I only hope they don't get hit again because they were hit by two in a row,"" Trump said. Trump's comments were reminiscent of former President George W. Bush's comments days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, when Bush praised his FEMA director Michael Brown during his first visit to the region affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,"" Bush said then. Trump's comments on Wednesday were not the first time he has praised the federal response in Puerto Rico. And while the death toll was not known when he voiced some of his earlier praise, they did come as disaster relief experts and local officials sounded the alarm about the slow pace of the federal response. ""Every death is a horror -- but if you look at a real catastrophe, like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering -- nobody has ever seen anything like this,"" Trump said in Puerto Rico less than two weeks after Maria struck. ""Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico."" Trump not only repeatedly praised the federal response, but he also struck out at the news media and critics who highlighted the slow pace of some of the recovery efforts and the dire conditions that much of the island continued to face for weeks and months after the hurricane made landfall. Ten days after the hurricane made landfall, Trump lambasted news reports about the troubled situation in Puerto Rico in a series of tweets. ""Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!"" In another tweet, he lashed out at San Juan's mayor, who had taken to the airwaves to raise alarm about the slow pace of recovery efforts. ""Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,"" he tweeted.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/politics/trump-puerto-rico-fantastic/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiB_7Sq6Mj6AhUgVzABHdmFDnU43AEQFnoECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw0T_70TsK1RYMgGZe-G3nRZ,CNN,Liberal
82,"Puerto Rico says nearly 3,000 people died in Hurricane Maria. So why have officials produced only 57 names?",John D. Sutter and Catherine E. Shoichet,8/31/18," Nearly a year later, they're still numbers.   Puerto Rican officials admitted this week that the death toll from Hurricane Maria, which hit the US territory last September, is 46 times higher than they'd previously said.  Not 64 dead, as was the official line.  An estimated 2,975 deaths. Yet that's just a statistical estimate -- an approximation.  Officials have still only released details on 64 of those individuals. They've named just 57.  Internally, Puerto Rican authorities have identified additional individuals whose deaths they consider to be hurricane-related, but their names have not made public, according to a Puerto Rican official who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on internal matters. The official asked the exact number of named deaths not be reported because they said that figure is not widely known even within the government. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló is forming a "" 9-20 Commission "" that will look broadly into additional uncounted deaths and recommendations produced by the George Washington University study that estimated nearly 3,000 people died, the official said.  September 20 -- or 9-20 -- was the date Maria hit Puerto Rico. Tying individual deaths to the storm is far more difficult and time-consuming than estimating the number of ""excess deaths"" that followed a hurricane like Maria, according to the official. ""If there is a death certificate or information on cases that can be associated to the hurricane, we want transparency, right? We want to make justice for everyone,"" the official said.  'They're just numbers, they're not people' Some friends and family of the deceased, however, say the government's handling of the death toll has been unjust -- even after the death toll was updated this week. ""For the government, they're just numbers, they're not people,"" said Lisa de Jesús, whose best friend, Reinaldo Ruiz Cintron, died while working in a cleanup crew after the storm. His death has still not been recognized by officials as storm-related despite the fact it was labeled ""victim of cataclysmic storm"" in a mortality database CNN and the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (CPI) sued the Puerto Rican government to obtain after officials wouldn't make it public. ""Those people left family behind -- left people grieving. ... It's not like (Puerto Rican officials) have to make a monument. But at least say, 'Hey, look, these are the people who died. These are the people who always will be remembered. These are the people who helped their country ... and they're not forgotten.' They were people. Important people. At least for us."" Tuesday's report from George Washington University -- which Puerto Rico commissioned for $305,368, according to the contract -- is just another number, an estimation, de Jesus said. It doesn't recognize the individual victims like her friend. Researchers initially proposed an assessment that would have included individual storm-related deaths -- likely including interviews with family members, medical providers and a review of hospital records, said Dr. Carlos Santos-Burgoa, a professor of global health at George Washington University and the principal investigator on the report Puerto Rico commissioned. That proposal was rejected, apparently because of the cost, Santos-Burgoa told CNN, with the understanding that a follow-up study might be commissioned. No such study has been agreed to, he said. Researchers are actively searching for a new funding source. ""When we were approached, we submitted an overall proposal that included the whole thing,"" Santos-Burgoa said. ""And they said, 'You cannot have it all. You look like a teenager -- you want to have everything! And you cannot have it.' ""It was much more complex. It had many more components, the original proposal."" ""They said, 'We are going to fund Phase I for the total mortality and let's see what happens with Phase II,"" he added. ""The government never committed to funding Phase II."" Puerto Rican officials did not respond to requests for comment on this account. Nor did they respond to questions about whether the official list of individual people whose deaths are hurricane-related has been updated. Rosselló, the island's governor, said in a press conference Tuesday that researching exactly who died in the storm could take months or years -- and it's unclear who would pay. ""We are using the best science available ... to be able to give a sense of closure to all of this,"" Rosselló told reporters at the event in Puerto Rico. ""The truth is there is a lot of work to do."" Officials will continue to investigate deaths and update the tally accordingly, he said.  Uncounted deaths CNN started raising questions about the Hurricane Maria death toll in October, after surveying funeral homes in one municipality and then contacting 112 of them across the island. Those reports, along with work by journalists from the CPI in Puerto Rico, The New York Times and others pushed Puerto Rico to commission the review. Rosselló first announced a review of deaths in December, citing news reports showing deaths were underreported. The governor in February held a press conference to announce that Puerto Rico had hired George Washington University to conduct the analysis. Since then, Puerto Rican authorities had told reporters that they would not comment on uncounted deaths until the study from George Washington University was complete. This week, after the report published, CNN sent Puerto Rican officials a list of people whose deaths the network has found appear to be related to Hurricane Maria based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The list named, among others,  three people -- including Ruiz Cintron -- whose deaths were labeled in records CNN and CPI sued Puerto Rico to obtain, as related to a ""cataclysmic storm ."" It also included two deaths labeled in Puerto Rico's own records as related to a waterborne illness, leptospirosis, that is known to have spread in the aftermath of Maria. (CNN and CPI reviewed a database of death records to show that an  unreported outbreak or epidemic of that disease occurred ; officials still refuse to call it that). Puerto Rican officials did not respond to repeated questions about the cases. At least one additional death was listed by officials as storm-related last year following a CNN report. 'It's been a year, almost' There's been ample time for officials to continue amassing evidence about who died and why, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. ""It's been a year, almost,"" he said. ""You would think there's already been enough time to make those lists and get the information out there. But they started from a place of minimizing fatalities. There were political challenges and communications challenges."" Controversy about Hurricane Maria's death toll started October 3 when President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico. In a press conference with Rosselló, Trump praised the relatively low death toll from the storm -- then 16 -- and said he was glad Maria did not have the death toll of a ""real catastrophe"" like Hurricane Katrina, which pummeled the Gulf Coast in 2005. Later that day, after Trump left the island, the death toll rose to 34. It now stands  higher than the toll from Katrina, which was 1,833 . The White House this week said in a statement from Sarah Sanders that ""the federal government has been, and will continue to be, supportive of Governor Rosselló's efforts to ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities resulting from last year's hurricanes -- the American people, including those grieving the loss of a loved one, deserve no less."" President Trump followed that up on Wednesday by saying that the federal government had done a ""fantastic job"" of responding to the disaster in Puerto Rico. Rosselló admitted mistakes in how officials communicated about the death toll in the aftermath of the hurricane, but he denied any political interference in the tabulation of the deaths. ""My only consideration is the well-being of the people of Puerto Rico,"" he said Tuesday. ""My only consideration was getting the best available information and the truth out there."" 'Where is the study to quantify how many lives were saved?' Political pressure has been mounting in Puerto Rico. In recent weeks, two officials at Puerto Rico's Bureau of Forensic Sciences, which reviews deaths, resigned, according to local news reports. (Both officials reportedly cited personal reasons). Additionally, some politicians in Puerto Rico have been calling for the resignation of Héctor Pesquera, who heads the Department of Public Safety. In an October interview, Pesquera told CNN any insinuation of political interference in the death toll was ""horseshit."" ""We have to move forward. We can't go backwards,"" Pesquera told a local Univision affiliate this week. ""If it's a question of blame, the government accepts it and I accept it, there is blame for everyone. But there was a catastrophe. That is the reason for all this. If that hadn't existed, would there have been 2,975 dead? No, probably not. So we have to attribute this to the hurricane."" He added, ""Where is the study to quantify how many lives were saved? That doesn't exist."" Rosselló said this week that he has confidence in Pesquera. The George Washington University report and others like it find that many hurricane-related deaths occurred well after the day of the storm -- raising questions about the adequacy of the federal and territory-level response to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath. A CNN comparison of power restoration in Puerto Rico versus Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Harvey in Texas, for example, shows widespread and lengthy delays in Puerto Rico. Thousands were without power for months -- some for the better part of a year. While it's unclear if the deaths were related to the void in basic public services, the George Washington report found ""excess deaths"" continued at least into February -- five months after the storm. That was especially true for poor people and older Puerto Ricans, researchers found. For residents in the lowest socioeconomic bracket, the risk of hurricane-related death actually increased in the months after the storm, peaking in January, the report says. Some people in remote parts of the island felt abandoned. "" We are the forgotten people ,"" Victor Manuel Belen Santiago, whose mother, Zoraida, died in February without power needed to run an oxygen machine, told CNN this spring. 'It still hurts so much' Not everyone thinks the names of storm victims should be released. Listing the names of the deceased raises privacy concerns and would be ""uncommon,"" said John Mutter, a professor at Columbia University who studied deaths after Hurricane Katrina. Still, he said, more information needs to be released about exactly how and why people died in order to do better next time. ""What needs to be released publicly is the statistics on cause of death, age, race, gender and, if possible, the location of the death -- where did people die."" The list of names does matter for some families and friends of the deceased, though. It matters symbolically in that some want their loved ones to be remembered publicly. And it also matters, potentially, in terms of government assistance. Families of people whose deaths are officially classified as storm-related may be eligible to have some funeral expenses reimbursed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The maximum payout for funerals and related expenses for eligible people is $6,000, a FEMA spokesman told CNN in November. There are other ways in which the death toll matters financially, too. Higher death tolls also tend to draw more attention from Congress and the public, so the accuracy of the figure matters a great deal in terms of disaster response, said Redlener, who heads the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia. ""If the government is putting out and the White House is confirming and gleeful about a very small number of fatalities, then you underplay the impact of the storm,"" he said, ""and that undermines the motivation for Congress, for example, to appropriate the right amount of money for response."" There also is an emotional punch, Redlener said. ""If your loved one died during or after a massive storm and the government is not even acknowledging that, it's very hard to get any kind of closure,"" he said. ""On the individual family level and on a community level the names are important -- and it's important that the names get acknowledged."" Lisa de Jesús wants her friend, Reinaldo Ruiz Cintron -- who loved the sea, loved crab fishing and wanted to see Puerto Rico rebuild after the storm -- to be remembered by name. The same is true for Juan Luis Ortiz Guzman, whose mother, Pilar Guzmán Ríos, died on September 29, 2017 without access to adequate medical services or power to run medical equipment. Guzman was so well-liked in her mountain community that neighbors said that ""even the cats prayed for Pilar"" when she got sick. She was known for raising three birds on her back patio -- and she'd taught them to chant the rosary and sing ""La Cucaracha."" ""It was not easy to lose my mama, and it still hurts so much,"" her son, Ortiz Guzman, said on Thursday. ""But to be in front of the television, and hear an official say, 'No, there were 64, and no more' ... it still infuriates me. ... So many people died because of this storm."" ""My loved one is gone. Mine is with God,"" he added. But if recommendations from the report are taken seriously, he said, ""at least in the future they can know and save our lives."" ""It's still painful,"" said Jan Marcos Fuentes Morales, Pilar's great-nephew. Some family members are still living in an informal shelter because their homes are damaged, he said. ""I would like (officials) to come here and see how families are still suffering. They should see that with their own eyes. Anyone they talk with is going to tell them about someone who died.""

37,The Story Behind The Updated Puerto Rico Death Toll And What We Can Learn From It,Carolina Moreno,8/30/18,"For nearly a year, experts and journalists had speculated there was a severe undercount of deaths after Hurricane Maria’s devastation of Puerto Rico. So it was no surprise this week when local authoritiesraised the official Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to 2,975, following the publication of an independent analysis by researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.Headlines focused on how the new death toll made the stormthe deadliest U.S. natural disaster in over a century. But Dr. Carlos Santos-Burgoa, a GWU professor of global health who was the lead investigator on the report, said the researchers’ purpose went beyond giving a more accurate count of deaths due to the storm, which made landfall on the island on Sept. 20, 2017.In a conversation with HuffPost, he discussed what went wrong in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Maria and his concern that other areas in the United States and the rest of the world could be similarly unprepared for a natural disaster of that magnitude.There was no way to monitor deathsSantos-Burgoa said one of the biggest problems in Puerto Rico was that the local government had no way to assess the magnitude of the storm’s impact in the days after it struck. He said acomprehensive and active total mortality surveillance system ― which can identify possible spikes in deaths by area and in subpopulations ― could have helped officials not only more quickly make a more accurate death count but also identify vulnerable populations in the aftermath of the storm. In 2012, for example,a study found that Texas’active mortality surveillance system helped the state calculate hurricane-related deaths more quickly and accurately than using vital statistics alone after Hurricane Ike in 2008. Without such a system, Puerto Rico’s public health officials didn’t have the information needed to develop appropriate interventions and allocate limited resources to communities that were suffering the most.“If you have only so many resources in any country or any state, more so in Puerto Rico, where are you going to put those resources? You should put them where you need them the most — in this case, where the most vulnerable populations are,” Santos-Burgoa said. “That’s what they should have done if they would have had the information.”The report found that during the study period, from September 2017 to February 2018, the death rate was 45 percent higher than normal for men age 65 or older and for people living in the island’s poorest municipalities. Mortality rates remained elevated beyond the study period, after which they had been expected to return to more typical levels.Researchers didn’t delve into why those populations were most vulnerable, but Santos-Burgoa said they hypothesized it had to do with the lack of resources and weaker infrastructure in poorer communities and a higher incidence of chronic conditions among the elderly.“Unlike infectious diseases, where you have an infection and you survive or die immediately, the consequences of what happens with chronic diseases are medium and long term,” he said, adding that if access to quality medical care and treatment is even temporarily affected, it can result in a person’s death.It’s a hypothesis supported by a Harvard study published in May, which estimated that the death toll in Puerto Rico was closer to 5,000 and found that most deaths in the months after Hurricane Maria were a result of interruption of medical care.But Santos-Burgoa stressed it’s not just Puerto Rico that is need of a mortality surveillance system that gives officials possibly lifesaving information in the aftermath of a natural disaster; all states and jurisdictions should have such a system as part of their disaster preparedness plans. “I am concerned and worried in general about the lack of culture of preparedness in the United States,” he said, adding that we instead focus on reacting to a disaster. “People cheer and applaud rescuers, but they never cheer for people who prevent and prepare. No news should be good news if there is a huge natural disaster and no lives are lost.”Few doctors blamed the storm on death certificatesBeyond providing a more accurate death toll, researchers looked into the death certification process and found that most physicians on the island had no formal training in death certificate completion, specifically in a disaster. Santos-Burgoa said that is far from surprising. “I am a medical doctor, and I was never trained to fill out a death certificate. Never,” he said. “That’s part of the usual training throughout the world, and here in the States, people are not trained to fill out a death certificate, less so under conditions of a natural disaster.”During interviews, some physicians said they were hesitant to designate a person’s cause of death as related to the hurricane. He said that rather than link a death to the hurricane, “doctors remained within their usual endeavors, which is medical phenomena.”This sort of miscommunication and the overall lack of training resulted in a limited number of deaths being identified as related to Hurricane Maria. Disaster preparedness is lackingThe report showed that public information campaigns before the hurricane failed to properly prepare Puerto Ricans for Hurricane Maria and that flaws in communication between agencies and communities limited the amount of public health and safety information that reached residents in the aftermath of the storm.Researchers made several recommendations to improve communication after a disaster, and Santos-Burgoa said the easiest and fastest to implement would be the creation of an interagency planning and communications committee to coordinate and monitor mortality surveillance during natural disasters. For Puerto Rico, the report also recommended creating a formalized communication network between the island’s central government and municipalities. This network would allow for more effective communication during a disaster and should also be used to have local officials weigh in on how the entire island prepares for emergencies.As far as Santos-Burgoa is concerned, what happened in Puerto Rico could happen in other areas in the United States where there are low levels of preparedness. He said one solution is for the federal government to create and require adherence to guidelines for jurisdictions to prepare for natural disasters, particularly ones as destructive as Maria. “My personal outlook is that the federal government should have a stronger say in assuring that the states are better prepared in general and not leave it as a state-level [decision],” he said. “You need to have the knowledge that can be brought by others, that can be shared by others, and also the resources, because it affects everybody.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-updated-death-toll-report_n_5b872244e4b0cf7b0031dc55,HuffPost,Liberal
83,"Hurricane Maria killed 2,975 people in Puerto Rico. It's the second deadliest US storm in over a century.",Nicole Chavez,8/29/18," Puerto Rico's new death toll from Hurricane Maria is making the storm one of the deadliest hurricanes in US history.  Authorities raised the death toll from last year's storm to 2,975 on Tuesday, which surpasses that of both Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which is responsible for 1,833 deaths, and the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane in Florida, which killed 2,500 people. The count in Puerto Rico could change as the government continues to investigate deaths from the storm, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Roselló said. Until the recent update, Puerto Rico's government had said only 64 people died as a result of the storm. The  Great Galveston Hurricane  of 1900 remains the deadliest recorded hurricane in US history.  When it made landfall on September 8, 1900, it destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 8,000 people within hours. The hurricane hit the Texas port city by surprise and had such a massive impact that it ""brought a new focus on the study of hurricane prediction,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. All three of the deadliest hurricanes were Category 4 storms when they made landfall. Deadly estimates in the spotlight News organizations and some members of Congress have raised questions about the official death toll in Puerto Rico, which had remained at 64 for months.  CNN reporters  surveyed about half of the funeral homes across the island  and found that funeral home directors identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related. In December,  The New York Times  estimated 1,052 ""excess deaths"" occurred after Maria. Others produced similar estimates. Democrats in the House, including some Hispanic Caucus members, have requested an investigation into the  Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria.  In June, Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for a commission similar to one established in the aftermath of 9/11 to look into the storm's ""death toll, the federal response and how FEMA and other agencies may have responded sluggishly based on artificially low numbers.""

Shoichet and Jason Kravarik contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/us/puerto-rico-deaths-new-york-9-11-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiB_7Sq6Mj6AhUgVzABHdmFDnU43AEQFnoECAkQAg&usg=AOvVaw0hTm_sXRV1dhQ7qnniuap9,CNN,Liberal
84,"How Puerto Rico's death toll climbed from 64 to 2,975 in Hurricane Maria",Ray Sanchez,8/29/18," Puerto Rico's true death toll    from Hurricane Maria remains elusive as the storm's one-year anniversary approaches.  The  island government raised the  official death toll to 2,975   on Tuesday after maintaining for months that 64 people had died as a result of the storm.  But the higher figure, based on the findings of researchers from George Washington University in a study commissioned by the US commonwealth's government, is only an approximation, not a concrete list of names, according to Gov. Ricardo Rossello.  ""This number can change,"" Rossello said. ""It could be less, it could be more, as time passes."" Here's how the official death toll has changed since the storm touched down September 20 as a Category 4 hurricane:  6 to 13 deaths In the chaos after the storm, the island's public safety director,  Héctor M. Pesquera, said at least  six people were killed . Rossello told CNN two days after the storm hit that  13 people had died  in the storm. That figure was based on reports from mayors on the island, but law enforcement authorities hadn't confirmed the total, the government said. Death toll rises to 34 Nearly two weeks after Maria, President  Donald Trump touched down for the first time and downplayed the devastation.  ""Every death is a horror,"" Trump said in early October before comparing Puerto Rico's official  death toll of 16  at the time to ""a real catastrophe, like Katrina,"" in which more than 1,800 people perished from the 2005 storm that ravaged New Orleans. After Trump departed, the governor announced the  death toll had risen to 34. One of the conclusions of the George Washington University study was that officials did nothing to respond to public criticism and concerns about political motivations that surged when the official tally jumped to 34 shortly after Trump's visit.  Funeral homes identify nearly 500 hurricane-related deaths In November, CNN reporters surveyed 112 funeral homes across the island, about half the total. They found that  funeral home directors identified  499 deaths  considered to be hurricane-related.  Official toll climbs to 64 In December, public safety officials  revised the official count to 64,  adding some fatalities newly certified as indirect deaths related to the storm. For instance, emergency personnel were unable to reach the home of a man who collapsed during the storm. Doctors had classified his death as natural, and it was not initially considered a storm-related death.  Other deaths later determined to be indirectly caused by the storm included a case of exposure to carbon monoxide, a suicide, a person run over by his own vehicle and a death from complications following a fall. Estimated 1,052 'excess deaths' after Maria    Also in December,  The New York Times estimated  1,052 ""excess deaths""  occurred after Maria. Other media produced similar estimates. Estimate of 4,645 deaths become rallying cry In May, a team that included researchers from Harvard University  published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine estimating  793 to 8,498 people died  in Maria's wake, a range that some academics have criticized as overly broad.  The study's midpoint estimate  -- 4,645 deaths --  became a rallying cry for activists upset by what they see as a lack of accountability for the scale of the catastrophe by officials in Puerto Rico and the United States. An estimated 1,006 to 1,272 deaths A research letter  published this month  in the medical journal JAMA  estimated that between 1,006 and 1,272 people died  in connection to the storm. Puerto Rican government admits to 1,427 more deaths than 'normal' The Puerto Rican government on August 8  quietly admitted the official toll  was higher than its December tally.  In a report to Congress, the government said documents show that  1,427 more deaths  occurred in the four months after the storm than ""normal,"" compared with deaths that occurred the previous four years. The 1,427 figure also appeared in a draft of the report -- ""Transformation and Innovation in the Wake of Devastation"" -- which was published and opened for public comment July 9.  The revised figure was first ""revealed"" by the Puerto Rico government, according to the final report, on June 13, one day after officials were  forced by a judge to release death records that CNN and the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico had sued to make public. But officials at the time stopped short of updating the official death toll.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/us/puerto-rico-growing-death-toll/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjJiPPG1sj6AhXeRDABHeGCAtI4HhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw3u0LsXh-u_MbXwffjoYEhB,CNN,Liberal
85,Puerto Rico's new Hurricane Maria death toll is 46 times higher than the government's previous count,"Leyla Santiago, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jason Kravarik",8/28/18," Puerto Rico's government raised its official Hurricane Maria death toll to 2,975 on Tuesday in the wake of a new estimate from researchers.  The new figure is 46 times larger than the previous toll the Puerto Rican government released in December 2017, when officials said 64 people had died as a result of the storm. It comes on the same day researchers from George Washington University revealed findings from a study on storm-related deaths commissioned by the US commonwealth's government. ""This is unprecedented devastation,"" Gov. Ricardo Rossello told reporters. But the new death toll is only an approximation, not a concrete list of names, Rossello said. Moving forward, he said, officials will continue to investigate deaths from the storm and refine the official tally. ""This number can change,"" he said. ""It could be less, it could be more, as time passes."" It could take months or years, he said, to come up with a complete list of storm-related deaths. ""We are using the best science available ... to be able to give a sense of closure to all of this,"" he said. ""The truth is there is a lot of work to do."" The official toll matters in part because families of those who died in the aftermath of the storm are eligible to have some funeral expenses covered by the US government. Experts say higher death tolls drive more disaster aid. And knowing precisely how and why people died can help authorities prevent future hurricane-related deaths. A key question: Will this new figure -- stemming from a study conducted at the request of Puerto Rican officials -- provide any closure to families that have long argued their loved ones died because of the storm but hadn't received any official acknowledgment?  A new study Researchers from George Washington University released a study earlier Tuesday, calculating excess deaths that occurred in the US commonwealth between September 2017 and February 2018.  The study , commissioned after the September 2017 storm, followed a number of others like it. And recently, the  Puerto Rican government had quietly admitted the official toll was higher  than its December 2017 tally. In a report to Congress earlier this month, the US commonwealth said documents show that 1,427 more deaths occurred in the four months after the storm than ""normal,"" compared with deaths that occurred the previous four years.  But the latest estimate was even higher. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz blamed President Donald Trump, the federal government and Puerto Rican officials for failing to provide adequate assistance in the aftermath of the storm. ""It's 2,975 people, and they're still calling it an estimate -- 2,975 people that will never see the light of day, and many of them died because of what was done by the administration and that was silently approved by most of the political class in Puerto Rico,"" Cruz told CNN on Wednesday.   ""The administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect,"" she added. ""The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us. ... Shame on President Trump."" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump ""remains proud of all of the work the Federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico,"" according to a statement issued after Tuesday's release of the new death toll estimate. To that, Cruz asked, ""What is there to be proud of? 2,970 dead. Is that what he's proud of?""  Researchers behind George Washington University's study said they felt they were able to provide a more accurate estimate because they took into account additional factors such as migration. ""I do think this study helps to validate that sense that many people had that there were just too many deaths,"" said Lynn Goldman, dean of the university's Milken Institute School of Public Health.  But she also stressed that Tuesday's report marks only the first phase of the study.  ""In the next phase, we would like to dig down deeper into that number to understand among all the deaths that occurred, which of them were related to Maria, which of them would not have occurred if it hadn't been for the storm? We're not able to say that now,"" Goldman said. She acknowledged that a complete list may never be possible. ""At the end of the day,"" she said, ""we may never be able to fully identify all those 2,975 people.""    'We are not going to revive them' With many different estimates emerging, it's hard to know whom to believe, said Lourdes Rodriguez,  whose father, Natalio, died in January .  ""This is up and down numbers. No one knows how or from what (source) is the real number,"" Rodriguez said. ""Due to the island being shut down, there was no way of knowing anything for a week or week and a half after the event."" Natalio Rodriguez's death hasn't been officially classified as related to the storm, but his family believes Maria was to blame. He died after the generator that was running his breathing machine ran out of gas. And no study, Lourdes Rodriguez said, can make up for what she and so many others lost. ""We are not going to revive them, unfortunately. We just have to be prepared or get prepared for the next event,"" Rodriguez said. ""September is one of the hottest months of the year, and you see people going to the beach and living in la-la land, as if nothing is going to come."" Governor: 'I made mistakes'  The George Washington University study also found that the risk of dying as a result of the storm was the highest for people living in Puerto Rico's poorest municipalities, and that older, male Puerto Ricans had a notably higher risk of death after Maria.  In addition, researchers looked at how storm-related deaths were certified, and they analyzed communication about deaths after the disaster.  Among the study's conclusions: Officials did nothing to respond to public criticisms and concerns about political motivations that surged when the official tally of deaths jumped from 16 to 34 shortly after Trump visited and  praised how low the storm's death toll had been . The governor admitted Tuesday that he'd made mistakes in handling the situation. ""I agree I made mistakes. I agree on that. ... This could have been done differently. I recognize all that,"" he said. ""However, I reject the notion that this was somehow connected to any political consideration. My only consideration is the well-being of the people of Puerto Rico. My only consideration was getting the best available information and the truth out there."" Rossello said he'd signed an executive order for a commission to begin looking at researchers' recommendations for improving communication and the death certification process, and that a memorial would be built to honor the storm's victims. Multiple estimates CNN and other news organizations have been raising questions about the official Maria death toll for months. In November,  CNN reporters surveyed 112 funeral homes across the island , about half the total. Reporters found that funeral home directors identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related. In December, The  New York Times estimated 1,052 ""excess deaths""  occurred after Maria.

This year,  CNN and the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, or CPI, in Puerto Rico sued the island's Demographic Registry  to make public a database with information about everyone who died in the months after the storm.  Using the same database, CNN reported on  deaths labeled in government records as hurricane-related that were not counted by officials ; and, in partnership with CPI, reported on  an apparent leptospirosis ""outbreak"" that was not identified as an outbreak by authorities. The network also  created an online database the public can use to search for the names of all the people who died in the months after the storm  -- and tell reporters about deaths that may have been related to Maria.

38,Hurricane María Has Renewed Puerto Rico's Fight Against Coal Ash,UNC School of Media and Journalism,8/17/18,"HUMACAO, Puerto Rico ― It’s 7 a.m. on a Monday, but already 19 people are at the gates of the El Coquí landfill to protest disposal of coal ash. Five of them, including Carmelo García, have been here since before dawn.Some protesters wear white T-shirts that say “For Your Health, Zero Ashes” in Spanish, while others hold a banner that reads,“No Ash Cancer.” Nine police officers and company security guards watch the protest from behind. The landfill in Humacao belongs to EC Waste, a waste management company, and already contains 7,000 tons of coal ash — the byproduct of burning coal for electricity. It is one of several coal ash deposits across Puerto Rico, and the ash is shipped here from a coal-fired power plant in Guayama, about 37 miles away. Applied Energy Systems (AES), the plant’s owner, also stores a five-story pile of ash on-site. Between 2004 and 2011, the AES plant converted 2 million tons of ash into filler for the construction of housing developments across Puerto Rico, according to the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a Puerto Rican nonprofit investigative journalism center. The plant has sent an estimated 400,000 tons of ash to landfills in Humacao and Peñuelas, while another 1.1 million tons of ash are unaccounted for, widely assumed to have been deposited in other areas of the island.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that coal ash contains arsenic, boron, chloride and chromium, all of which have negative health effects. That ash residue can leach into groundwater and soil, and breathing the dust can cause respiratory issues.Exposure to the chemicals in coal ash has been linked to bladder, stomach, skin, lung and kidney cancers, asthma, emphysema and infertility, according to a 2010 study by Physicians for Social Responsibility. The ash is also radioactive, and long-term exposure to radiation can result in cancer and genetic issues according to the EPA.Many of the protesters gathered at the Humacao landfill on this balmy morning say they’ve already seen these health effects in their friends and relatives.“To the administration of EC Waste, we’re saying that these ashes can’t be there, more ashes can’t come out, because they contaminate and sicken everyone,” said Timmy Boyle, spokesman for the Alianza Comunitaria Ambiental del Sureste (ACASE), speaking into a makeshift speaker system from the top of a red pickup truck.It’s been more than a year since new coal ash was dumped in the landfill, but ACASE believes the dumping may resume soon as the island’s coal-burning plant returns to its level of energy generation pre-Hurricane María. They want to stop the dumping before it starts again, and are demanding the closure of the plant and an end to ash deposits on the island.“En contra a las cenizas, el pueblo se moviliza!” they chant: “Against the ashes, the people mobilize!Buried In The AshWhen María made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 last year, it destroyed the island’s power grid, rendering the AES plant in Guayama, the island’s sole coal-burning power plant, inoperable for five days.Though the Puerto Rican Board of Environmental Quality ordered AES to cover its ash piles before the hurricane, it did not. The largest ash piles, in Guayama and Peñuelas, lost meters of ash in the storm, and ashes floated free all over the island, turning the air gray and contaminating the groundwater with heavy metals and radioactivity, according to the newspaper El Nuevo Día and a study for AES released earlier this year. AES could face fines of up to $75,000 for failing to cover the ash, according to El Nuevo Dia, but there has been little update since.While the storm brought new attention to the coal ash here, the movement against it is much older. AES sent 57,000 tons of ash to the Dominican Republic between 2003 and 2004 until residents there filed a lawsuit to stop it in 2009 over concerns about miscarriages and birth defects, according to the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo. AES now primarily deposits its ash in Puerto Rico, though the newspaper La Perla reported in April that the company is shipping to an undisclosed amount to Jacksonville, Florida.The Puerto Rican legislature approved a new law in July 2017 prohibiting the disposal of coal ash on the island and giving local plant operators 180 days after production to remove the ash. The law allows for the ash to be turned into cement or designated for another commercially beneficial use. But many in Puerto Rico say the new law is ineffective, largely because AES does not consider its coal combustion residuals to be coal ash. It’s a mix of ash and water they call “AGREMAX” that can be used in construction — a classification that has resulted in the continued storage of thousands of tons of coal ash on the island. The EPA also issued new rules for coal ash disposal in December 2014 that called for the closure of impoundments and landfills that don’t comply with engineering and structural standards. But the new rule classified coal ash as non-hazardous industrial solid waste and left enforcement largely up to states and local governments.For Puerto Rican activists, the storm has reinvigorated concerns about how coal ash will be handled on the island going forward, and they are putting pressure on the government to find a solution. Taking A Stand Yanina Moreno stands at the fence outside the AES plant in Guayama with her camera, documenting the change in the ash pile adjacent to the plant. She came here with her family after the storms, she said, and saw the pile was significantly smaller, the ash likely scattered in the winds.On a Sunday in March, she and two activists from the group Comunidad Guayamesa Unidos por tu Salud take pictures from the public road outside the plant and discuss the issues the ash has caused them. Their conversation pauses as a security van pulls up alongside them and slowly passes the group. Its driver radios for backup, and moments later, two employees in AES jumpsuits arrive to confront the activists. The three say they aren’t doing anything illegal, but an argument ensues. Moreno records it all on her phone. This has happened every time she has come to take photos and videos of the plant. She believes AES keeps track of the people who approach their property and pays special attention to the protesters.Moreno is the spokeswoman for Campamento Contra Cenizas de Carbón, a group based near the Peñuelas Valley Landfill that has also been receiving ash from the AES plant since 2015.The group has been protesting the dumping of ash since the beginning, but Hurricane María increased the group’s concerns about contamination. Between July and August 2017, 709 new truckloads of ash were brought to Peñuelas ― 12,000 tons of coal ash, according to the local press. The Peñuelas community didn’t know about the new deposits brought in last summer, Moreno said, but figured it out when they saw trucks heading toward the landfill, ash flying behind them. Residents began to notice a persistent, fine layer of black dust coating their floors, furniture and yards. “The cleaning was so continuous,” Moreno said. “You would see glass tables with this layer of dust.”They worry the ash was spread further during the hurricane.Over the past five decades, Peñuelas has also been home to petrochemical and petroleum plants and incinerators, said Moreno, so pollution isn’t new here. But the coal ash is the most recent, and possibly the most dangerous.“We are in a zone that has been highly contaminated,” she said.Six of her neighbors died of cancer and respiratory illnesses in a span of just three weeks last summer, she said. Moreno and other protesters suspect the ash is making people sick in a town that has the third-highest rate of cancer on the island, according to the Cancer Register of Puerto Rico.Moreno said the government refuses to acknowledge the community’s health problems as a consequence of the ash and has not yet conducted the health studies in the area that her group has demanded.“Our worry is to not keep paying the consequences, to not keep bringing other industries, other contaminants that aggravate the situation,” she said. “Because then our community will disappear.”The Detrimental Impact Of Coal AshCarmelo García, a member of ACASE who lives less than five miles from the EC Waste landfill in Humacao, believes his group’s activism has helped prevent new ash from being dumped there for nearly a year. Hurricane María drastically changed the landscape for the movement.As of March, García had not had electricity in six months. He and his wife were running a generator for three hours every morning and evening to sustain their home. But García has still been active in coal ash protests in his town.He said he started protesting coal ash pollution five years ago when he noticed his grandmother’s asthma worsening after trucks carrying the ash started passing through his hometown of Maunabo. His scientific and chemical background — he has a doctorate in chemistry and teaches at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao — led him to investigate why his grandmother was getting sicker when everything else in her life was constant. He began to suspect the ashes were affecting her lungs.The more research he did, the more concerned he became.“As soon as I sat down and read some of the pages, I said, ‘Oh my God, this is a criminal thing they are doing. This is a time bomb,’” he said. “The only option was to join the movement and to help them.”Now García wants to communicate the dangers of coal ash to people affected by the landfills and the transportation of coal ash.“Here at stake is the very life of the people living not only in Guayama, Peñuelas and Humacao,” he said. “Here at stake is the life of the people living on the island, because this is not a big island.”García said the landfills are not equipped to contain the ash during hurricanes. And while the storm slowed coal-burning on the island for months, he worries the drive to dump will resume. “We know (that) as soon as the grid is up, they are planning to start burning like hell, and we will start getting not only the ashes they produce but the ashes they already had,” he said. “And we are talking here thousands and thousands of tons of ashes.”A Demand For Accountability And Change Under a tent in front of the capitol in San Juan in the early afternoon of March 15, protesters and journalists mingle among pictures of the Guayama landfill at one of the first coal ash protests since the storm. There’s a giant banner highlighting the communities in Puerto Rico affected by coal ash that reads: “CONTAMINATED WITH ASH.”Protest groups from across southeast Puerto Rico are there, including Campamento Contra Cenizas de Carbón and ACASE. The air thrums with a sense of urgency. A few days before, news had broken about the presence of chemicals and radioactive materials in groundwater near the AES plant in Guayama — evidence, they feared, that the coal ash was leaching these chemicals into the environment.Miriam Gallardo Gonzalez of the Frente Afirmación Sureste (FAST), a group based in Guayama, gave an emotional speech about miscarriages and animals born with defects in her community — both caused by the ash, she said. “The problem of the ashes is real,” she said. The groups had penned a letter with a list of demands and to deliver to Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz. “We are demanding, among other things, first that the Department of Health and the Board of Environmental Quality intervene immediately in the contamination,” said Víctor Alvarado, the spokeswoman for the Comité Diálogo Ambiental de Salinas, an environmental advocacy group from Salinas, a town along the path the ash trucks took from Guayama to Peñuelas.The protesters want the state to classify coal ash as a hazardous waste, change the way the ash is tested and perform tests for radioactivity. The biggest request, however, was simple: They want the coal plant shut down for good, so no more waste is created.Photos and video by Aubrey Patti, Darian Woehr, Alexis Fairbanks and Kaitlin Harlow.

86,A closer look at Omarosa's excerpt on Puerto Rico -- from a reporter who was there,Maria Santana,8/17/18," Only a few paragraphs of Omarosa Manigault Newman's book are about Puerto Rico. But their claims are significant: that President Donald Trump lacked empathy in Hurricane Maria's aftermath and that the President and Chief of Staff John Kelly referred to Puerto Ricans in derogatory terms.  The result, the new book titled  ""Unhinged""  alleges, was a slow and cavalier response to the devastation wrought, especially when compared to Trump's swift and effective handling of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida weeks earlier.   Manigault Newman, a former senior White House adviser, wouldn't specify what offensive terms the Trump administration allegedly used when referring to Puerto Ricans, even when pressed to do so during one of her many interviews to promote her book. CNN has not independently verified her claims, and the White House did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. I was in Puerto Rico when  the Category 4 storm tore through  the island on September 20. I witnessed much of what the book describes about conditions and response on the ground unfold in real time. The White House has branded Manigault Newman a liar, and many have questioned her tactics, her motives and her accuracy. But based on what I witnessed in Puerto Rico and what I read in her book about the hurricane response, this might be one example where she got it right. Here are three claims the book made and my analysis of their veracity. Claim 1: Trump had a vendetta against the mayor of San Juan In the book, Manigault Newman says that it would not surprise her if Trump was taking out his ire with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on the people of Puerto Rico. ""I would not put it past Trump to punish the people of Puerto Rico to teach that woman of color a lesson,"" she wrote. Indeed, the President did engage in a very public feud with one of the harshest and most vocal critics of his handling of the crisis. Yulin Cruz was a frequent presence on television and didn't hold back her low opinion of Trump and his administration's response. ""We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,"" Yulin Cruz said at one news conference. Trump struck back swiftly and fiercely. ""The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,"" the President tweeted on September 30 from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he was spending the weekend. ""Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort."" Yulin Cruz told MSNBC she wasn't saying anything nasty about the President; she just wanted help. ""Rather than being a commander-in-chief, he's like a hater-in-chief. He continues to tweet his hate all over the place,"" she later told CNN's Don Lemon. Claim 2: The administration's response was too slow Manigault Newman, who was fired by Kelly last December from her role as the White House Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison, also puts much of the blame for what she calls the administration's ""lethargic"" response directly on the chief of staff. She says Kelly was slow to approve aid and that he blamed the island for its troubles following Maria. In those crucial first days after the storm, I did not see any federal agencies leading a sustained rescue and recovery effort. Many Puerto Ricans were doing much of that work themselves, and as people grew more desperate and water became more scarce, I remember many reporters on the ground asking, ""Where is the National Guard? Where is FEMA?"" When he was asked -- six days after Maria hit -- why no federal aid had yet reached Puerto Rico, Trump explained that it was difficult  ""because it's on the island  -- it's on an island in the middle of the ocean. It's out in the ocean. You can't just drive your trucks there from other states."" Trump says US working hard on hurricane response I saw local officials finally distributing FEMA-provided food for the first time more than a week after I arrived on the island, and not only did the meals mainly consist of sweets and ready-to-eat snack items, also described in Manigault Newman's book, there were often not enough to go around. In the immediate aftermath of Maria, the President gave himself and his administration a 10 -- on a scale of 1 to 10 -- for the hurricane response to Puerto Rico. But in a report issued last month, FEMA acknowledged that mistakes were made. The agency concluded it had vastly underestimated the island's ""insufficiently maintained infrastructure."" Claim 3: Trump and Kelly lacked empathy The former White House adviser wrote that in a national security meeting after the hurricane struck Puerto Rico, ""(Kelly) said, 'Their infrastructure was already screwed up,' and suggested the bankrupt government was trying to exploit the hurricane to force the United States to rebuild  their electrical grid. "" Trump's lack of empathy about Puerto Rico She said she fought ""arm in arm"" with former Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert to try to advocate for Puerto Rico, but that Kelly shut down those efforts. The fact is, it took Trump two weeks to visit Puerto Rico, even as the images dominating the news showed shortages of electricity, water, food and gas. In contrast, the President was in Texas and Florida within days after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit. Once on the island, Trump indeed complained about the territory's fiscal problems, at one point saying, ""I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget out of whack.""  He then proceeded to toss rolls of paper towels to victims gathered at a church. Trump's reaction to the lives lost was was also criticized as callous. He congratulated local officials, telling them  they should be proud  that -- unlike Hurricane Katrina -- only 16 people died. ""Every death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous -- hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here, with really a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody's ever seen anything like this. What is your death count as of this moment? Seventeen? Sixteen people certified, 16 people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together,"" he said then. We now know that the number of hurricane-related deaths was severely undercounted. Earlier this month, the Puerto Rican government  revised the death toll  from 64 to more than 1,400. Many died in the aftermath of the hurricane, due to lack of power, food and medical care.

39,Bringing The Light Back To Puerto Rico After Last Year's Horrific Hurricane Season,UNC School of Media and Journalism,8/16/18,"VEGA BAJA, PUERTO RICO — “I thought I was never going to see light in my home again,” said Elsia Cruz Torruellas, 65, as she stood on the front porch of her beige house, looking out at the electrical wires that had just been lifted from the ground and reconnected by a man she had known for only a few minutes.Alberto de Jesus Mercado, the man who restored her power, is a 59-year-old electrician and environmental activist who has taken it upon himself to bring power back to hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were still in the dark.Mercado is known colloquially as “Tito Kayak.” Tito, short for Alberto, and Kayak, in reference to the many activist protests he has launched from a kayak. Kayak has been a certified electrician for more than 30 years. It had been six months since Cruz Torruellas’ home in Vega Baja lost power during Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Maria came through 14 days later, toppled power posts and brought electrical wires down across her front yard and driveway, trapping her and her family inside the home. The family was among the 3.3 million Puerto Ricans who lost power during hurricanes Irma and Maria, which severely damaged the island’s electrical grid and initiated the longest blackout in United States history. The entire island lost an estimated 1,248 million hours of potential energy consumption. Six months after the storm, approximately 121,000 residents were still in the dark. By June 1, the beginning of Puerto Rico’s hurricane season, 11,000 people had no electricity.“The cables didn’t let us leave the upstairs patio or the house,” said Torruellas’ daughter, Maritza Ramirez Cruz, 39. She and a cousin had to crawl underneath the cables to get out of the home. Once they did, she realized they wouldn’t be able to get the car out of the garage because a power pole had fallen on top of the metal fence on their property.They walked down the block onto the main road and found some workers from the Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, known in English as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), Puerto Rico’s main energy supplier. They begged the PREPA employees to help move the downed wires, which would allow her mother to get out of the house and allow them to use their car.The workers moved the wires just enough to let the rest of their family into the yard and give them access to the garage. The men laid the wires between the pickets of the fence, stringing them mid-air across the front entrance of the house about five feet off the ground. That was the last time they saw anyone from the power authority. “We practically had to bring them by force — after that they never came back,” Ramirez Cruz said.For weeks, Cruz Torruellas called the power authority, trying to get workers to come fix the electrical pole that had fallen. It wasn’t safe for her 11-year-old grandson, Nahuel, to play in the yard. “When [PREPA] would actually answer her call, they would tell her that the issue had already been reported,” Ramirez Cruz said. “Other times the call would ‘drop.’” The power outage was extremely difficult for her mother. Many in Puerto Rico struggled with the loss of power, but Cruz Torruellas depends on the internet to do her work, which includes maintaining her blog and participating in writers workshops. She also homeschools Nahuel and, in order to keep him up to speed with the public school curriculum, needs to access online teaching materials.Family friends Orlando González Claudio and his wife Rosa Villalonga told her about Kayak. Kayak isn’t the only one taking it upon himself to restore power. Some of his friends help him every now and then and when they do, they refer to themselves as the “Electricistas En Acción,” or EEA, a play on the Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, or AEE — the actual power company. “The efforts that individuals make and the efforts that the government makes, I don’t think they’re parallel,” Kayak said.But they aren’t the only ones who’ve felt like they need to step in. Desperation across Puerto Rico has forced plenty of people to pick up wires themselves.NPR and The Associated Press have reported stories from San Sebastián de las Vegas del Pepino, on the far west side of the island, to Coamo, deep in the south, where tired Puerto Ricans are fed up with waiting for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and construction crews to get to them.Their workers include volunteers from police chiefs, former utility workers, teachers and accountants. They have managed to restore power to thousands of homes through large brigades.But unlike those groups, Kayak goes out on jobs alone, save the extra set of hands he will recruit from the “EEA” for particularly difficult jobs. And he’s in places that supposedly already have electricity — places like Vega Baja, which the power company has marked as complete despite many still lacking power.The First ConnectionIn mid-March, Kayak arrived at Cruz Torruellas’ home, distinguishable by its patterned accents painted in pink, same as her fence. Kayak lives a minimalist lifestyle, partly due to a lack of resources. He doesn’t own a car, so he drives his daughter’s green Jeep Grand Cherokee and straps on a borrowed silver extension ladder with thick yellow ties to the roof rack. He uses a makeshift pulley system to extend the ladder by tugging on the straps, eliminating his need for a partner.He said he knew right after the hurricanes that it would take months for the island to fully regain power.Kayak is an independent contractor who has been performing electrical work since he was 14. He typically works for local businesses and sometimes gets one-time contracts from large corporations, but he currently spends most of his time restoring power to houses that still lack it following the storms.He started a few weeks after Maria, reconnecting the home of an elderly woman in Manati, over an hour west of the capital, who had lost power during Irma. A friend asked Kayak to help her so she could use her dialysis machine. Since then, Kayak has taken the government’s responsibility into his own hands. “Geez, we can do this ourselves, for the community,’” he thought to himself. “It was so cool, the people were happy.”Puerto Rico’s power grid continues to be discussed as a main reason for the island’s inability to regain and maintain electricity after the storms. Through the restoration process, sporadic blackouts have been a testament to the fragility of the commonwealth’s power grid.“The electrical devastation was incredible, my God,” said Kayak, “One hundred percent of the electrical system collapsed.” And even with power now restored for much of the island, there have been setbacks. A February explosion at an electric substation, which was blamed on mechanical failures, left northern parts of the island without power soon after they regained it through recovery efforts. The explosion was reported to have hit another two substations, extending the blackout further and inducing a loss of hundreds of megawatts of energy.There are also frequent smaller neighborhood blackouts that aren’t reported. The Santurce district in the heart of San Juan had a blackout last over eight hours in mid-March. In April, another two major outages took power from Puerto Ricans. On April 12, as electrical crews attempted to clear land, a tree downed a main line to San Juan and left 870,000 customers without power. Not even a week later, on April 18, other reparation attempts threw the island back into a total blackout — the first since Hurricane Maria. The estimate from PREPA and other officials was that power would not be fully restored from Maria’s initial hit until May.Kept In The DarkIn October, the American Public Power Association reported that the island needed 50,000 new utility poles and 6,500 miles of cables.PREPA’s increasing debt ― $9 billion as of 2017 ― is due to years of mismanagement and has left the company running on equipment nearly three times older than the national industry average. This means the hurricane-damaged equipment that repair crews are attempting to fix has been long overdue for replacement. With about 80 percent of the electrical grid destroyed, it will take time just to rebuild the system, especially in the mountainous regions, and reconnect every home to the grid.“The Power Unified Command set a goal to have 90 to 95 percent restored by the end of March with others into April and May in the mountainous, hard-hit areas,” said Ken Higginbotham, who works in FEMA’s External Affairs.As of July 6, FEMA spokesperson Juan A. Rosado-Reynes reported that 99.85 percent of power has been restored.Puerto Ricans feared the restoration would not be completed before hurricane season began. The six-month season of winds and rain will make the already vulnerable system susceptible to falling again. “I think that this government agency (PREPA) works in a very bureaucratic way. It has to pass information to FEMA, and, from FEMA, it passes information to those whom they decide can fix the problem. And that enlarges the process, making it inefficient, delayed,” said Kayak.Reconnecting power in Manati made him realize that he could help bring power back for more people.  “I don’t have to go to FEMA or The Electric Power Authority,” he said. “Since I’m not with them, I just go directly there.”When González Claudio and Villalonga called Kayak to tell him about Cruz Torruellas’ family’s situation, it didn’t take him long to get there. “They let him know about what we were going through. All but two days had passed after they told him when he arrived to our surprise,” said her daughter Ramirez Cruz.Privatizing PowerPuerto Rico’s $73 billion debt crisis, which predated the storm, is another drag on rebuilding the power system. The island faces a double-digit unemployment rate and a declining population due to mass migration to the mainland. Forty percent of its population lives below the poverty line.PREPA, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2017, is responsible for $9 billion of that debt. The government-run PREPA, which is the only energy company on the island, has held a monopoly in Puerto Rico for nearly 80 years.The entity relies on purchasing imported fossil fuels and burning oil to generate electricity, not only contributing to pollution but also forcing customers to pay rates that follow foreign oil prices. In 2014, PREPA was unable to pay for fuel. After many negotiations, the authority instituted unpopular bill increases to help pay for its debt while making no effort to move toward its long-awaited shift toward renewable energy.In 2016, the Puerto Rican Senate asked the FBI to investigate PREPA for fuel purchasing irregularities. In January, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether PREPA had committed crimes “against the public interest,” following a United States Army Corps of Engineers report on construction materials PREPA was allegedly hoarding in a supply warehouse in Palo Seco. The supplies were supposed to be distributed equipment to help re-establish the island’s power grid, but PREPA reported the materials “out-of-stock.” Not having access to them has delayed the restoration process.In January, Rosselló put forward a plan to privatize PREPA, which he argued would lower the island’s debt and make the power company more accountable.“The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,” Rosselló said. “What we know today as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority does not work and cannot continue to operate like this.”According to The Associated Press, privatizing PREPA and allowing competitors to bid for the island’s customers would be the “largest restructuring of a public entity in U.S. history.”Privatization works well in theory and sounds attractive to a large population of the Puerto Rican people, but only because they don’t understand the negative repercussions, said Ricardo Santos Ramos, former president of Puerto Rico’s Electrical Industry and Irrigation Workers Union. “There is not a single country in the world where privatizing electricity has lowered its cost,” he said, “Energy will be more expensive if it is private.” Right now, he explained, PREPA sells energy at the price it costs to produce it.“If we privatize it, the private company is going to sell us what costs them, plus an increase to make the profit we will give them,” Ramos said. He is adamant that Puerto Rico, being an island, needs to have its own autonomous energy reserve. Independence from the foreign countries supplying fossil fuels, as well as autonomy from the U.S. mainland, would allow the island to become reliant on its own electricity and not need to wait for aid from the federal government. Ramos believes that privatizing the power authority would not only raise costs for consumers but would move Puerto Rico further away from a long-promised shift to other forms of energy.“Privatizing electrical power plants is to forever bury the possibility for us to make an orderly transition into renewable energy,” Ramos said.Anna Sommer, an energy analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a group that studies economic issues dealing with energy and the environment, said that “PREPA can and should do better” when it comes to “promoting energy independence and affordability by aggressively pursuing energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy investments.”Tito’s CrusadeKayak’s minimalism carries over into his style. He is easily recognized under his dark, greying hair when he wears shirts bearing the logos of his various activist causes or having to do with his electrical work. “People in Puerto Rico know me as an environmental activist. They don’t know that I am an electrician,” said Kayak. “People think that Fidel Castro, that [Hugo] Chávez sends me money and they state it openly on social media. ‘Look at that Chávez, at that Fidel! They sent him money,’ and they don’t know how hard it is for me to earn my daily bread.”“People say, ‘Isn’t that the guy who’s always protesting around, starting revolutions? And now, turns out he’s an electrician,’” said Kayak.One of his main environmental causes, Amigos del MAR, or “Friends of the Sea,” began a protest camp called Las Playas Son Pa’l Pueblo, “The Beaches Are for the People,” which is among the longest-running civil disobedience resistance camps in the U.S. Kayak and his friends established a large camping spot on a beach in San Juan, protesting in response to a large hotel company that wanted to buy the land and privatize the beach for its guests. MAR also stands for “Movimento Ambiental Revolucionario ― or “Revolutionary Environmental Movement.”Kayak is also known for protesting the U.S. military’s acquisition of land on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques for a training camp and bombing range. In 2000, Kayak flew to New York and climbed onto the crown of the Statue of Liberty during the New York marathon to hang banners that said “Peace Vieques.”Kayak sees his work restoring electrical service to dozens of homes, free of charge, as an extension of his activism. Most of the supplies he uses to install power he finds in enormous junk piles that have accumulated on the sides of roads since Maria.“Sometimes it is as simple as taking a cable, raising it up and pinning it, that’s it,” he said. “Even today, at six months — or more than six months — there is still a lot of material lying in streets and they don’t pick it up.”He does his work almost exclusively with borrowed equipment and the tools he has bought over the years from his contractor work. Even his ladder is borrowed, and it doesn’t even reach the top of the power poles he’s working on. But he gets the job done anyway.Photos and video by Rob Gourley, Ruijia Zhang, Alexis Fairbanks and Kaitlin Harlow. Graphics by Avery Williams.

40,Puerto Rico's Natural Revolution After Hurricane Maria,UNC School of Media and Journalism,8/15/18,"Ian Pagán Roig went to bed on the night of Sept. 19, 2017, not knowing what his world would look like when he woke up.The night before Hurricane Maria was set to make landfall, Pagán, a 29-year-old farmer in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, faced crushing uncertainty. Hurricanes were not unusual in this part of the Caribbean, but a Category 5 storm was beyond many farmers’ experience. There was no one to ask for advice on how his farm, El Josco Bravo, might survive Maria’s intense and unrelenting wind speeds.Pagán, a tall, gentle man with large brown hands, had tried to secure the farm. He dug trenches around his fields, removed the roof from his greenhouse and sheltered his two oxen, Caramelo and Josco, in his brother’s garage. He then took refuge in his concrete house, hoping that it would make it through the storm.He’d never felt more vulnerable.“You can’t do anything more. The hurricane’s coming,” he said. “You have to be humble.”He awoke to a devastated landscape. A huge palm tree lay across the entrance to the farm and pools of water filled its valleys. The surrounding forest, stripped of every leaf, looked like a scattering of giant sticks jammed into the ground. There were pools of standing water from the intense rains. His land looked anything but ready for growing vegetables. And yet one month after the storm, El Josco Bravo was once again producing crops.Pagán rebounded quickly because he views his farm as an ecosystem, one that should be self-sufficient and resilient just like a natural Puerto Rican forest. It was no coincidence that his farm that imitated these qualities recovered quickly from Hurricane Maria. Across the island, Puerto Rico’s forests outpaced many of the human systems in regrowth after the storm, and Pagán was not the only one watching. In places like El Yunque, the island’s 28,000-acre national forest, sun-loving plants quickly sprang up under the opened canopy, providing shade for other species and making way for the reformation of the forest structure. These natural systems, shaped by centuries of evolution and adaptation, knew how to rebuild after the disaster, but scientists in El Yunque and beyond still hope to gain new insight on how the ecosystem works and what humans can take away from it to prepare for the next big storm. For many observing the island’s recovery, Maria offered one big lesson: When disaster strikes, it is nature itself that holds the best lessons on resilience.‘A Toothpick Forest’Forests are an integral part of Puerto Rico’s environment. They cover 60 percent of the island, shading urban and rural areas alike. Magnificent native palms, squat platano trees with elephantine leaves and orange-flowered, soft-barked African tulip trees populate the land with their vibrant green and tropical splendor. In El Yunque National Forest, one of the oldest forest reserves in the Western hemisphere, the lush tree canopy stretches smoothly across the northeastern corner of the island. The thick foliage offers a shady respite to hikers wandering through the forest on a hot, sunny day. That all changed after Maria. The 155 mph winds, rains and subsequent landslides damaged or killed an estimated 23 to 31 million trees across the island. The gusts ripped up smaller plants by the roots. The lush canopy and foliage disappeared overnight.“It was a toothpick forest,” said Grizelle Gonzalez, a soil scientist at the International Institute of Tropical Forestry.Gonzalez works in El Yunque and lives several kilometers north of the forest in the town of Luquillo. During the storm, she felt her house shake, and water came in horizontally through the metal shutters covering her windows. The sounds of growling, cracking and whistling surrounded her as Maria hit the Luquillo Mountains, one of Puerto Rico’s primary topographic barriers against storms. This was not Gonzalez’s first hurricane. The 46-year-old, who wears bright pink lipstick with her muted tan and green U.S. Forest Service uniform, was also on the island for Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. But when she finally made it outside a day after Maria’s landfall, the sight of the decimated forest still shocked her.“It was like a bomb hit,” she said. “It was like the temperate forest right before winter is coming, and it’s like, but I’m here!”For Gonzalez, the completeness and intensity of the destruction in the forest was almost overwhelming. But deep down she knew it would recover, as it was adapted to do. Over the next few months, the forest would prove her right.A System Tried And TrueRight after Hurricane Maria, Ariel Lugo, the 75-year-old director of the International Institute of Tropical Forestry, went into the forest to take a picture. It was of a site, identifiable by data collection instruments, that he had been photographing since the day after Hurricane Hugo hit the island 28 years ago. He wanted to document the forest’s recovery timeline, and the post-Maria picture would be the last in the series, a way to bring the project full circle. But he also went to check on one specific type of tree: the tabonuco.Tabonuco trees grow on the ridges of mountains where the wind blows strongest. They are one of the tallest species in the forest, but despite their height, tabonucos hold their ground during storms that rip away their leaves. This is because of their interconnected root systems, Lugo said. An entire group of trees can be united and deeply entrenched in the ground. Though fallen trees littered the forest, Lugo wanted to see if the tabonucos were still standing.They were.The tabonucos are one example of a species that has taken adaptive measures to withstand Puerto Rico’s hurricane cycle. With intact root systems, the tabonucos can quickly restart water and nutrient uptake, and begin regrowing leaves.Another resilient tree species is the Cecropia schreberiana, a pioneer species and one of the first to occupy a disturbed area. The post-hurricane landscape of open sky and bare ground provides a perfect nursery for its hardy seedlings. Cecropia can rapidly grow to 50 feet tall, and the shade cast by its giant leaves provides the optimal conditions for slow-growing, shade-tolerant species to take root beneath it. In March, six months after the hurricane, the growth of Cecropia and other sun-lovers like ferns, grasses and shrubs was in full swing, and they dominated the forest floor. Trees rising above the bushy undergrowth sported tufts of leaves at their crowns and around their stubby branches. When the Cecropias die off, the understory clears and allows other plants to close the canopy. In 10 to 15 years, the average person walking into El Yunque will not be able to tell that anything happened there, Lugo said. In 25 years, dead trees will be decomposed and recycled. The canopy will have fewer pioneer species and more slow-growers settled in. In 100 years, only scientific research and acute observation will be able to reveal the marks of the hurricane left after the forest’s incredible recovery system.“Nature has natural selection,” Lugo said. “If something doesn’t work, it gets eliminated and you get an alternate.”While scientists like Lugo and Gonzales have been studying forests and hurricanes for decades, Maria’s strength and impact gives them new insights into the recovery process. It may also help them predict what may happen in future storms.“If you can predict what’s going to happen fairly confidently, then you can take steps to manage it or tolerate it,” said Nicholas Brokaw, an environmental science professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. “That’s our goal in science.” In the past three months, the Forest Service has restored data collection equipment in the forest that Gonzalez said will be essential for observing and documenting the changes happening there during the recovery process.“This is actually the first major hurricane that hit the whole island, and that we have the research infrastructure to really document,” she said.Success At El Josco BravoPagán’s farm, which recovered more quickly than most after the hurricane, offers a model for regrowth based on nature’s resilience. The young farmer, clad in tall rubber boots and a straw hat during his busy days at El Josco Bravo, attributed his success to three strategies. One was his preparation for the storm, including removing his greenhouse roof and digging trenches. The winds blew through the empty skeleton of the greenhouse, and the trenches around his fields gathered the water and prevented erosion of the soil Pagán has spent three years cultivating. Pagán said other farmers failed to take these preventative measures partly out of complacency – the relative mildness of Hurricane Irma gave them false confidence, he said. But Pagán had too much at stake to take any chances.His second strategy was his permanent infrastructure, mainly his greenhouse and his lake. These structures meant he didn’t have to spend time rebuilding his nursery or water supply. But his third strategy was most important, and it was his agroecological philosophy.As a part of this philosophy, Pagán doesn’t rely on machinery, because it requires non-renewable fuel inputs that, in Puerto Rico, come in as imports. After the hurricane, other farmers waited in 10-hour lines to get gas to fill their tractors, but Pagán’s “tractors” ran on grass, and occupied themselves during the storm munching on breadfruit from a fallen tree nearby. On Oct. 3, two weeks after Maria, Pagán harnessed up his oxen and started ploughing his two acres of land.Pagán also uses cover crops and makes compost from his neighbor’s yard waste to increase nutrients and water retention in his soil, which boost its fertility without the use of chemical fertilizers. Pagán, who did his master’s thesis at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez on organic methods of soil recovery, could place his young crops in the rich brown earth as soon as they were big enough to come out of the greenhouse.Pagán’s recovery paralleled that of El Yunque – both places built their regrowth on animals, sunlight, water and natural resources that didn’t need to come in from overseas. This is the result of agroecology, and Pagán saw his ability to produce food so quickly after the storm as evidence that his methods give farmers the tools to produce food even after great disturbances. “The hurricane suddenly changed our reality,” said Pagán.This combination of environmental systems and farming practices is what helped Pagán successfully survive Hurricane Maria, and it is what Gonzalez hopes Puerto Ricans see when they look at how the forest systems are continuously evolving.“It’s important that people understand that these systems are very resilient,” she said. “Given the time to recover, the forest will respond positively.”Photos and video by Alice Hudson, Gabi Palacio, Alexis Fairbanks and Kaitlin Harlow.

87,"Puerto Rico says power restoration after Hurricane Maria is complete, but that's not quite right",Leyla Santiago and Natalie Gallón,8/14/18," Power restoration after Hurricane Maria, which struck almost a year ago, has been completed, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. ""According to our reports, all of our clients that were without service since Maria now have electricity,"" said Geraldo Quiñones a spokesman for the power authority, which is known as PREPA. He added that the customers ""form part of the recuperation process of the electrical system after the devastation of the hurricane."" The utility tweeted a picture  of ""Charlie, Jazmín and children from Ponce,"" indicating the family was the last to have power restored. But those living in El Yunque National Forest take issue with the claim. ""It's something that's not true,"" resident Jose Saldaña Jr., 43, said on the phone, denying that power was restored, with frustration in his voice. Saldaña told CNN on Tuesday that he and his family have yet to see power restored to their home and local business inside El Yunque, on the northeast side of the island. His family runs La Muralla, a small business that has been selling local food in El Yunque for the past 40 years. His parents, both in their 60s, live above the business, and haven't had power since Hurricane Irma hit the island, weeks before Maria wreaked havoc in Puerto Rico. Saldaña said power has not been restored because of a back-and-forth with the US Forest Service and PREPA. When asked why PREPA is claiming 100% power restoration when El Yunque residents still don't have power, Quiñones said they ""don't have control in El Yunque"" and pointed at the US Forest Service, saying the utility needs the agency's permission to be on federal land and install posts. Sharon Wallace, the forest supervisor for El Yunque National Forest, acknowledged the complexities of power restoration in El Yunque. ""I think they're (PREPA) doing the best they can,"" Wallace said. According to Wallace, PREPA asked to install a new power line that would have required a lengthier process and special permission. To restore power to the existing line however, Wallace said PREPA does not need additional permission to maintain the line in El Yunque. ""We knew from the beginning we would be one of the last ones,"" Wallace said, adding that power for the Forest Service headquarters was restored in April. Quiñones said the two organizations remain in constant communication. ""We are confident that this will be resolved soon,"" he said. In the meantime, Saldaña said frustration is growing. His family business was shut down for five months after the hurricane hit. The family runs a generator about 15 hours a day, more than what's recommended, and spends about $180 a week on fuel to run it. ""It's more work, more sacrifices, more costs,"" Saldaña said. PREPA has 1.47 million power customers and returning power to the island after Maria has been a challenge after what has been the largest blackout in US history and  the second-largest in world  history. Just last week, an outage knocked out power to almost 130,000 customers. Power was quickly restored. But Puerto Ricans on the island say the instability causes anxiety, especially during the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. Nearly 3.4 million residents were left without power on September 20, when Hurricane Maria struck, as the island struggled with Hurricane Irma's brush earlier that month. ""It's like they've forgotten us,"" Saldaña said.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/14/us/puerto-rico-power-restored/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjL-fbA58j6AhUVSDABHW9xCNY40gEQFnoECAMQAg&usg=AOvVaw2-defph_JS9vVooHDBHtl-,CNN,Liberal
41,Youth Circus Brings Joy To Puerto Rico A Year After Maria,"St. Louis American, Contributor",8/10/18,"By Sophie Hurwitz Ariana Rubi Ruíz lives next door to a circus tent. When the 14-year-old resident of Dorado, Puerto Rico, was 6, she watched the tent being built in the backyard next door. Day by day, she remembers, she’d watch through the fence separating her backyard from the big top. The circus teachers eventually asked if she wanted to join and offered her a scholarship to make that possible.That was at the beginning of the National Circus School of Puerto Rico, which is part of the social circus movement ― a growing group of schools around the world that teach circus arts to at-risk young people to help them build self-confidence and be a force for social good.Ariana is one of dozens of students who spent years with the circus. Then, last summer, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, bringing 155 mph winds and widespread flooding. It crippled the roadway system and knocked out most of the electrical grid. The government initially said the death toll was 64; on Thursday it acknowledged that number was likely a little over 1,400. And a Harvard University study released last month says Maria probably killed over 4,600 people on the island.Many of the National Circus School students lost their homes, and all lost power and had limited access to food for months. Some of the students’ homes still have not been reconstructed completely.“The hurricane is not the worst thing. It’s after the hurricane,” said San Juan resident and circus coach Jafet Irizarry. “You have to deal with yourself, you have to deal with the people around you.”Leslynette Ramos Irizarry, Jafet’s sister and the resident psychologist of the National Circus School, remembers the lack of resources after the hurricane.“Everybody got anxious, like, lining up to get gasoline,” she said. “People spent eight hours in line for gasoline. We didn’t even bother trying to get gas until about the fourth week, because the lines were so long. And the line in the supermarket? It was like, OK, you can only buy 10 things, and only these certain things.”Ricardo Martinez Lopez, 18, of the National Circus School of Puerto Rico, started college four days before the hurricane hit. Those four days were the only college education he got for many months. “Coming from a place where you are used to daily having a struggle, and always having to push yourself … and to have something hold you back even more, was really hard,” he said.Jessica Hentoff, the director of Circus Harmony ― a social circus group based in St. Louis ― took notice. Like the National Circus School of Puerto Rico, Circus Harmony uses the teaching and performance of circus skills to build community, as well as to build confidence and social skills in its students, many of whom come from marginalized communities.The group has previously created circus partnerships under the name Peace Through Pyramids in Israel and in Ferguson, Missouri. Hentoff made a donation to help restore the National Circus School’s big top tent. Then, nearly a year after Maria hit, she decided to take the St. Louis Arches ― the elite youth circus troupe that performs as part of Circus Harmony ― to Puerto Rico to join with the National Circus School and create a touring act. The Peace Through Pyramids Puerto Rico program was born, with the purpose of creating intercultural connections and bringing hope to communities still hurting from the hurricane.“Socially, most of these kids that are coming with us have never met anyone from Puerto Rico, much less hung out with them,” Hentoff said. “And of course, they’ll find out, ‘Oh, they’re just circus kids,’ because that’s what happens wherever we go. Everyone lives in their own little bubble, but to really go somewhere totally different, where the life experience is so different ― and yet, they’ll be seeing the circus side of it, so it’s the same.”Nine circus students from St. Louis, ranging in age from 13 to 23, joined with 10 Puerto Rican circus performers to become what they called Revolution for Harmony Circus.Most of them could not speak each other’s languages, but Hentoff said that wasn’t a problem.“There are ways to communicate both verbally and nonverbally, but the common language is circus, and you have a common goal,” she said. “To create a show. And when you’re on that path, the details like the exact words don’t matter that much. Circus is so broad a language, and it’s so easy to say, ‘Like this’? You know, just by doing it. I mean, look at human babies. That’s how they learn.”By the end of their first day together, the kids from St. Louis and Dorado were laughing, picking up each other’s slang and dancing salsa.Ari Maayan, an 18-year-old St. Louis Arches performer who has been unicycling for “about four or five years,” used his skills to bond with the Puerto Rican students.“I can connect with people who unicycle much better than I can otherwise,” he said. “I can teach them tricks, and they can teach me tricks.”When he got to the circus tent in Dorado, he bonded quickly with a young Puerto Rican performer named Ilka Miranda who could do tricks he had never attempted before, like jumping rope backward on a unicycle.The students trained together and became one team. Then, they went on a whirlwind tour of Puerto Rico, visiting the towns of Adjuntas, Comerio, Yabucoa and Dorado, along with the old city of San Juan and the island of Vieques. In each place, they connected with community organizers who helped spread the word about the circus coming to town. Sometimes, the circus coaches would even come to people’s houses and knock on their doors to tell them there was a circus in the plaza, soccer field or basketball court. The coaches helped older people who couldn’t walk to the circus themselves.Each town was in some way still affected by the hurricane.About 30 percent of the population of mountain town Adjuntas still doesn’t have lighting, according to community organizer Rebeca Rodriguez. She works with Casa Pueblo, an organization that has begun distributing solar panels and mini-refrigerators to those who need them.The group also distributed gifts and toys to the children in Comerío and Yabucoa, held juggling and tumbling classes in Adjuntas and Dorado, and traveled alongside a group of doctors to the island of Vieques.Vieques, a former U.S. Navy base, now has the highest rate of chronic illness in the Caribbean. The island lost all its power after the hurricane, and the hospital lost much of its capacity. Now, it only functions as a crisis clinic, which means medical care for chronic conditions is nearly inaccessible there. The circus kids provided a distraction ― children could attend a juggling workshop while doctors screened people in the other corner of the plaza.People needed to see something like Revolution for Harmony’s shows, Rodriguez said.“[The circus has] really been a blessing for the town ― to be able to relax, to have a tranquil mind, so you don’t have tension,” she said. “You’re bringing something very beautiful for our children.”Edgardo Larregui Rodriguez, an activist and artist in the town of Comerío, said public art experiences are a necessary part of healing Puerto Rico.“Art is what unites us in our community,” he said. “It is an activation of the abandoned spaces. It’s an action of reclaiming community. It’s not just drawing, or painting, or making sculptures, but a vision of community, of uniting people to make public spaces better, or to imagine the possibilities of an abandoned space to encourage people to become active, to get away from their houses, to get away from their television.”Before the students began their tour, psychologist Leslynette Ramos Irizarry gave the group a tutorial in what they should and shouldn’t say to people ― “Never say, ‘I know how you feel.’ Because they have been through a disaster. You don’t know.” ― and asked why they were doing this tour. The students answered: “Distraction.” “Hope.” “To make people happy.” But Hentoff said even her own students sometimes underestimated the circus’ ability to make a difference. “They don’t realize how appreciated they are by the people who are seeing them,” she said. “And not because of the tricks, just because they showed up. To the kids, we’re just doing another show. I wonder if they realize how much it means to them, that someone from outside the town came.”The Puerto Rican performers hope to continue the cultural exchange by visiting St. Louis. A grant of $5,000 from all-star Cardinals baseball player (and Dorado native) Yadier Molina has helped them jump-start their fundraising for the trip. “I just love the environment, and what it makes you do as a person, and how it pushes you to be a better person,” said Lopez of the National Circus School of Puerto Rico. “Not just physically, because yeah, you’re working with your body, and you’re doing things that normally a human being would not do, but it also makes your mind stronger because you have to believe in yourself. You have to believe in your partners and in your group, and have that state of mind of, ‘I can do this, I can do whatever I want.’ And circus has taught me that.”Hentoff agreed with that sentiment.“When people hear ‘circus,’ they think it’s light and fluffy, like cotton candy,” she said. “And they hear ‘kids,’ and they think it’s just a bunch of kids doing cartwheels. And they don’t realize the depth and impact of the work on the individual children, on the audiences, and also the level of what they’re going to see. It’s much more dense than cotton candy, and certainly a lot higher-level than cartwheels.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
88,New Puerto Rico death toll amplifies Trump disconnect on relief efforts,Jeremy Diamond,8/9/18," Less than two weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, President Donald Trump took to the island to praise the federal officials in charge of the recovery efforts and  declare they could be ""proud"" that the death toll  had climbed to just 16 people. ""Every death is a horror -- but if you look at a real catastrophe, like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering -- nobody has ever seen anything like this,"" Trump said then. ""Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico."" Two weeks later, he gave his administration a 10 out of 10 for its response in Puerto Rico. Even then, Trump's comments struck many as tone deaf. The US territory's 3.5 million residents still lacked access to potable water and nearly all the island lacked electricity. Local officials and others on the ground were already sounding the alarm and critics were calling attention to an all-too-slow pace of the recovery efforts. But now, the government of Puerto Rico is revising the 64-person death toll it declared in December, estimating that more than 1,400 people died as a result of the devastating hurricane -- or 400 short of Hurricane Katrina's death toll -- raising questions about the effectiveness of the federal response to the hurricane and its aftermath. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Thursday the Trump administration is continuing to aid Puerto Rico. ""There's only one official count and the actual counting of disaster related fatalities is the local responsibility of Puerto Rico. We have been supportive of Governor (Ricardo) Rossello's efforts to ensure a full accounting and transparency. Those grieving deserve no less,"" he said in a statement to CNN. ""The whole of government remains focused on ongoing recovery and preparedness for the current hurricane season.""  The new estimate it follows several other studies in recent months estimating the death toll surging well past 64 to anywhere from 1,000 to more than 4,000. Even as those studies emerged and Puerto Rico continued to struggle to restore power to the entire island, Trump offered no indication the federal response needed to be re-evaluated or examined. Instead, during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in June, Trump continued to lavish praise on federal officials. He declared himself ""very proud"" of federal officials work to beat back last year's devastating hurricane season and said ""our entire government leapt into action to coordinate the response along with state and local leaders."" ""We really appreciate the job you've done,"" Trump told FEMA officials and members of his Cabinet. ""I want to thank you very much."" FEMA admitted in a July report that it was understaffed and underprepared for last year's hurricane season. In Puerto Rico in particular, the agency admitted it did not have enough supplies on hand when Maria hit the island. The agency also said in a 65-page report that ""FEMA leadership acknowledged that the Agency could have better anticipated that the severity of hurricanes Irma and Maria would cause long-term, significant damage to the territories' infrastructure."" The latest death toll estimate from Puerto Rico's government and Trump's repeated rosy assessments of the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico evoked comparisons to President George W. Bush's praise for his FEMA Director Michael Brown during his first visit to the region affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,"" Bush said during a visit that came just four days after Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, when -- just like Trump's remarks -- it was still unclear how high the death toll would rise. Trump not only repeatedly praised the federal response, but he also struck out at the news media and critics who highlighted the slow pace of some of the recovery efforts and the dire conditions that much of the island continued to face for weeks and months after the hurricane made landfall. Ten days after the hurricane made landfall, Trump lambasted news reports about the troubled situation in Puerto Rico in a series of tweets. ""Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!"" In another tweet, he lashed out at San Juan's mayor who took to the airwaves to raise alarm about the slow pace of recovery efforts. ""Such  poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan , and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,"" he tweeted.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/09/politics/trump-puerto-rico-death-toll/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjikvij2sj6AhVAmIQIHfS9BHI4RhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw1aeA2A7FmdFHOG7zXcU5No,CNN,Liberal
42,Power Was Finally Restored To Almost All Of Puerto Rico. Then Another Outage Struck.,Dominique Mosbergen,8/8/18,"Hours after Puerto Rico officials announced that power had finally been restored to almost all of the island’s residents — almost a year after Hurricane Maria devastated the U.S. territory — a new problem with the power grid reportedly plunged thousands of people into the dark once more.Puerto Rico’s electric provider tweeted Monday that just 0.002 percent of its nearly 1.4 million customers (some 25 people) remained without electricity, marking a significant milestone in what’s been a long and challenging post-Maria recovery journey.Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, told The Hill that he expected the remaining 25 customers to “receive electricity within the coming weeks.” On Monday afternoon, however, hours after the utility’s tweet, another large power outage was reported on the island. Local newspaper Caribbean Business reported that some 130,000 residents were left without electricity following the failure of a transmission line originating in the Costa Sur power complex in Guayanilla.CBS News reporter David Begnaud said Tuesday that power had been restored to the affected areas. Customers had been without power for under two hours, he said. In an earlier tweet, however, Begnaud had pointed out the continuing problems of the island’s faltering grid. “As of now, [the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)] says only 25 customers still don’t have [power]. On a side note, blackouts happen almost daily,” he wrote on Monday.Intermittent power has been a huge problem for Puerto Rico residents since Maria. In April, the entire island lost power in what’s been described as the second-largest blackout in history.PREPA, together with the U.S. government, has been harshly criticized for its response to Maria’s devastation. The utility faced intense backlash last year when it signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings ― a small, Montana-based firm with just two employees ― to help with the island’s power restoration efforts. PREPA eventually backed away from the controversial contract.The sluggish pace of power restoration in Puerto Rico has been blamed for many post-Maria deaths. One example was the January death of Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, whose family told CNN that the 77-year-old died because they couldn’t afford to power a breathing machine that had kept him alive.Harvard researchers estimated earlier this year that almost 5,000 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria ― a number more than 70 times larger than the government’s official death toll of 64. More than 30 percent of households surveyed for the study said they’d struggled with interruptions to medical care after Maria. Ten percent of those impacted households said they’d been unable to use respiratory equipment because of a lack of electricity.On average, households went 84 days without electricity after the storm, the study found.

89,"Finally, 11 months after Maria, power is restored in Puerto Rico -- except for 25 customers",Jessica Campisi and Jaquetta White,8/7/18," Nearly a year after Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, officials there say   power has been restored to most of the island's residents. Of the nearly 1.4 million customers who lost electric service after the storm, just 25 remain in the dark, the island's electric provider  tweeted Monday . The declaration, coming about two months into the start of the Atlantic hurricane season, is a significant development from Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. The beleaguered state-owned utility has struggled over the last year to recover from last September's storm, which decimated the island's electrical grid. Thousands of people were  still without power in June .  CNN has reached out to PREPA and has not received a response. The damage and the response Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, the  strongest storm to hit the US territory in 85 years . It resulted in the largest blackout in US history and the  second-largest  in world history. More than 10,000 people were still without electricity at the start of hurricane season in June, eight months after the storm. Since the storm, PREPA has come under fire for signing a  $300 million contract to restore power  with a small, Montana-based firm that had only two employees at the time. It canceled the contract after widespread criticism, and its  executive director stepped down in November . The slow restoration of power has been cited by  residents and some researchers as a factor in dozens of deaths  occurring after the storm. The family of one man says he  died from a pulmonary disease in January  because they couldn't afford to power a breathing machine that helped keep him alive. Federal officials have said restoration efforts have been slowed by the island's remote location and the poor condition of its infrastructure and roads. FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer Michael Byrne said in June that the agency has improved its response efforts since Hurricane Maria and has more relief supplies, including generators, on hand this hurricane season.

90,"Warren, Sanders introduce debt relief bill to benefit Puerto Rico",Veronica Stracqualursi,7/25/18," A number of potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are behind a bill that would allow Puerto Rico to terminate its $73 billion in debt. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, introduced a bill Wednesday that would give the US territory a way out of its crushing debt crisis exacerbated by the damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017.  The US Territorial Relief Act of 2018 includes as cosponsors two other Democratic senators mentioned as prospective 2020 candidates: Kamala Harris, from California, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-New York -- the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the House -- plans to introduce companion legislation in the House. The relief act aims to allow US territories to ""terminate their public, unsecured debt"" if they meet two of the following criteria: population decrease of 5% over 10 years, received major federal disaster assistance and per capita debt going beyond $15,000. Puerto Rico qualifies under these criteria. ""Puerto Rico was already being squeezed before Hurricane Maria hit, and will now have to rebuild under the weight of crushing debt,"" Warren said in a  news release  on the bill Wednesday. ""Our bill will give territories that have suffered an extraordinary crisis a route to comprehensive debt relief and a chance to get back on their feet."" The senators propose that Puerto Rico's governor and Legislature approve the debt relief, since Puerto Rico is a self-governing territory. The bill would then designate a ""special master"" to allocate $15 billion to creditors Puerto Rico owed. The bill would not extend to bond insurers, large financial firms and hedge fund investors. ""Disaster funding and the other resources in struggling territories' budgets must not go to Wall Street vulture funds who snapped up their debt,"" Warren said. Under the bill, eligible US territories would be allowed the option to terminate their debt only once every seven years. The measure would also create a commission to do an audit of the causes and sources of Puerto Rico's debt.  The Caribbean island has been in an economic recession for over a decade and in May 2017 it  filed for bankruptcy , the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing ever in the US. Four months after filing for bankruptcy, Puerto Rico was hit by the strongest storm the island has seen in 85 years: Hurricane Maria.  When he was a candidate, Donald Trump said he would not "" bail out "" Puerto Rico, but as President and following Hurricane Maria, Trump  floated the prospect  of wiping out Puerto Rico's debt burden.

91,"A man harasses a woman for wearing a Puerto Rico shirt, saying it's 'un-American'",Susannah Cullinane and Amanda Jackson,7/11/18," An Illinois park is investigating after a woman accused one of its police officers of standing by as a man harassed her for wearing a shirt with the Puerto Rican flag, saying it was un-American. Mia Irizarry says she was trying to celebrate her 24th birthday in the  Forest Preserves of Cook County  last month when the man approached her asking her why she was wearing the sleeveless Puerto Rico flag shirt, which also had ""Puerto Rico"" written below the neckline. Irizarry recorded the encounter on her phone, saying she felt threatened, and posted the video to Facebook.  On Monday,  Forest Preserves of Cook County tweeted  that it was aware of the June 14 incident and video. ‏""After the incident, we immediately launched an investigation pursuant to our personnel policies into the response of our officer,"" it said, in a series of posts on Twitter.  The officer resigned Wednesday, the forest agency said. The investigation into the incident continues, the agency said. Timothy G. Trybus, the reportedly intoxicated individual involved in the incident, was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct, according to a police report. He is scheduled for his first court appearance August 1, the Cook County Circuit Court said. He will be represented by a public defender, but one has not been assigned to him yet, the public defender's office said. CNN has attempted to reach Trybus for comment. ""All people are welcome in the Forest Preserves of Cook County and no one should feel unsafe while visiting our preserves,"" the agency said. On Tuesday, park spokeswoman Stacina Stagner said investigators will interview the officer this week about the incident. She said the investigation would wrap up soon, but did not elaborate on a timeline. On Wednesday, Cook County Commissioner Jesús ""Chuy"" García called for elevated hate crime charges against Trybus.  ""A charge for simple assault or disorderly conduct is not sufficient,"" García said. ""We cannot allow that ugly rhetoric to be the norm in Cook County."" CNN has called the state attorney's office for comment on possible consideration of hate crime charges. García said Forest Preserves should speed up its investigation and discipline the officer involved, ""up to and including termination."" 'Officer, I feel uncomfortable' In the footage, a man can be seen approaching Irizarry saying: ""You should not be wearing that in the United States of America."" He gets closer to her and asks ""Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?"" Irizarry can be heard saying that Puerto Rico is part of the United States and the man approaches her multiple times.  Irizarry asks a park police officer to help, saying, ""I am renting this area and he's harassing me about the shirt that I'm wearing."" Later she says: ""Officer, I feel entirely uncomfortable, can you remove ... please officer"" as the officer is seen walking away from her. Then she says: ""Officer, I'm renting, I paid for a permit for this area. I do not feel comfortable with him here, is there anything you can do?"" The officer can then be seen talking to the man who gesticulates back and tells him to ""shut the f*** up."" Female officer steps in More police arrive and Irizarry says she still doesn't feel safe. The man resumes his abuse, saying: ""You're not American, if you were American you wouldn't wear that. You know that right?"" A female officer asks to see his ID and can be heard telling him that he's intoxicated, to which he replies, ""Well that's your judgment."" She explains that Irizarry has a permit and she warns him that he could be arrested ""for not being compliant."" ""You don't come here harassing people,"" the officer continues. ""People have just as much right to be here as you and when you're drunk, you don't belong here."" The female officer then speaks with Irizarry, who gives her version of the incident and the officer explains that they were called to the area after a report that a man was choking a woman. Eventually the first officer on the scene takes notes of Irizarry's account of the incident and says that he was at the scene due to the separate incident, noting that she was not being attacked though acknowledging she felt threatened. Irizarry can be heard explaining to the officer that the incident began when they had asked the group the man was in if they could move as they had a permit for the area. She said the group politely complied but her Puerto Rico shirt appeared to act as a trigger to the man. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello was on CNN's Erin Burnett ""OutFront"" on Tuesday night discussing the incident. He said he was ""shocked, appalled and disgusted"" when he watched the video. ""This was an attack of an American citizen on another American citizen,"" he said. ""Puerto Ricans have been part of the United States and we've been fighting wars with other fellow Americans. We are proud US citizens. People need to understand that."" US commonwealth Puerto Rico is a US commonwealth  with its own constitution, rather than a state. Puerto Rican residents have been American citizens since 1917 and have the right to vote in US presidential primaries, but not in presidential elections. The Trump administration has received criticism for its treatment of Puerto Rico,  particularly for its response after Hurricane Maria struck  last September.

92,Beryl weakens to low pressure system as it moves toward Puerto Rico,Eric Levenson,7/8/18," Tropical Storm Beryl, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season, was downgraded Sunday to a remnant low pressure system, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 11 p.m. Sunday, the remnants of Beryl were moving over the northeastern Caribbean Sea. It is expected to drift south of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by Monday, bringing squally rains and occasional breezy conditions. Puerto Rico is not currently under any warnings or watches from the hurricane center. Such advisories were discontinued Sunday afternoon for Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, Saba, St. Maarten and St. Eustatius. The Meteorological Service of Barbados has discontinued the tropical storm watch for Dominica, which was  torn apart  by Hurricane Maria last September. The government announced earlier Sunday that a curfew and  state of emergency will go into effect  at 4 p.m. on Sunday. The  water system  will also be shut down at 2 p.m. Track Tropical Storm Beryl here Rainfall amounts are expected to reach between 2 to 3 inches across the Leeward and Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. Local amounts of up to 5 inches are possible, according to the hurricane center. ""While we don't expect a direct hit to take place on Puerto Rico, even some of those outer bands ... have the potential to knock out power"" on the US territory, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello declared a state of emergency for the island on Friday. Puerto Rico preps Though the storm was far from the strength of major Hurricanes Maria and Irma last year, Beryl still posed a threat of wind and rain to areas that have not fully recovered from those destructive storms. Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico's electrical grid and caused the deaths of an untold number of people. The US commonwealth  was ordered to turn over to CNN  and another news organization a database of information on all deaths that occurred after Maria pummeled the island. An academic report has  estimated that 4,645 people died  due to Maria's destruction. News of Beryl's approach was enough for Puerto Ricans to flock to stores to stock up on water and dry goods. Frances Colon, a Miami resident who was on the island for a wedding, shared a photo Friday morning of a line of people that spread to the parking lot of a Costco in the city of Bayamón. ""People are very aware, and they want to be prepared,"" Colon said. ""No one taking a chance with Beryl,"" she tweeted. ""It's all anyone talks about wherever we go. I don't blame them."" Others shared photos of the crowds lining up to buy supplies. Gabriel Rivera-Cruz, a resident of San Juan, went to the same Costco on Thursday night with his family and was surprised to see long lines of people already there. ""I think the memories from (last year's) hurricanes are so fresh that we have a clear idea of the effects and which items can be scarce or hard to find,"" he said. ""Most people I know are aware that this storm doesn't seem to be a second Maria, but is simply a wake-up call that the hurricane season is here and we are still extremely vulnerable,"" Rivera-Cruz added.

93,Puerto Rico pushes for statehood by 2021,Veronica Stracqualursi,6/28/18," In the wake of Hurricane Maria, the island territory of Puerto Rico is making a new push to become a state within the next three years.  Puerto Rico's representative in the House, Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón introduced the bill Wednesday that would make the territory a state ""no later than January 1, 2021."" This is the second time González-Colón, who has no voting power in the House except in committees, has pushed for statehood since elected resident commissioner. ""The catastrophe left behind by Hurricanes Irma and María unmasked the reality of the unequal treatment of the American living in Puerto Rico, forcing the Executive to approve waivers and Congress to make exceptions so that we could receive help,"" González-Colón said in a news release Wednesday. ""My colleagues saw firsthand the effects of this unequal treatment due solely to our territorial situation. Statehood is nothing else than Equality; and this Admission Act provides the means to put into effect the values of Democracy and Respect upon which our Nation is built."" Ricardo Rosselló, Puerto Rico's governor, echoed her.  ""The fight for Puerto Rico's Equality is one of civil rights,"" he said in the release. So far the bill has bipartisan support and currently 37 co-sponsors -- a majority of which are Republicans. The Puerto Rico Admission Act of 2018 proposes creating a bipartisan task force -- the Congressional Task Force on Equality for American Citizens of Puerto Rico -- of nine members to help with the transition and make recommendations to Congress. The Caribbean island is still recovering from Hurricane Maria and is currently in a financial crisis. Last year,  97% of Puerto Ricans  voted in favor of statehood in a nonbinding referendum, though only 23% of voters cast a ballot.   Congress would have to pass a statute to admit Puerto Rico as a state, which President Donald Trump would also have to approve. Héctor Ferrer, the president of an opposing party in Puerto Rico that favors keeping the island a commonwealth, pushed back against the bill, saying it's dead on arrival and intends to distract from the country's problems. Puerto Rican residents have been American citizens since 1917. Its residents can vote in US presidential primaries, but not in presidential elections. ""For some issues we are considered a domestic territory, for others we are a foreign country. Those differences in federal law have to end,"" González-Colón told CNN en Español's Juan Carlos Lopez in an interview Wednesday. ""If not, the economic situation and the civil rights issues will not improve until we put a stop to this.""  She added that if granted statehood, ""Puerto Rico would definitely be a battleground for both"" Democrats and Republicans. During a lunch at the White House last Thursday, Rosselló told President Donald Trump that Puerto Ricans ""want to be a state. We want equal treatment."" Trump joked that the process would go quickly since ""Ricardo is going to guarantee us two Republican senators.""

94,What 2 CNN reporters want you to know about Puerto Rico,Harmeet Kaur,6/15/18," It's been more than eight months since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. People are still using tarps for roofs. Officials are worried another storm could wipe out power on the island again. And a new estimate of the death toll suggests thousands more died than we knew. CNN correspondent  Leyla Santiago  and senior investigative reporter  John Sutter  are seeing it unfold firsthand, documenting the devastation and digging on the death toll. I asked them to give me and others on the mainland a window into what it's really been like over there. Our Slack conversation, condensed and lightly edited for clarity, is below. Harmeet Kaur:  Did you know immediately when you got to Puerto Rico that Maria was going to be as devastating as it was? Did you expect to spend months covering the disaster?   John Sutter:  I arrived in Puerto Rico a few weeks after the storm. And I was absolutely floored by the level of devastation. After that much time, I expected to find some level of normalcy. I didn't.  People were sleeping in homes without roofs, drinking water from a federal Superfund site because they didn't have working taps. Power was a SUPER luxury. Power lines were draped like spaghetti in the trees. Some roads were impassible. It was a mess. It felt like the hurricane had hit the day before and that time had frozen. Several months later, it still feels like that in some parts of the island.   Leyla Santiago:  Absolutely not. I was on the island for Hurricane Irma, and stayed for an entire month after María. I never expected it to be so bad, despite the government warnings.  The moment I woke up the morning of Sept. 20 and heard that ominous hum as María approached, I knew this was different. I stepped outside, and the winds were incredible. It was hard to stay standing.  When we flew out of San Juan several days after the hurricane and I got an aerial view of the island, I realized this wasn't just different -- it was devastating. María would change the island and its people.   Kaur:  Has it been frustrating to see other stories instead dominate much of the news cycle? Have you felt like the story hasn't gotten the attention it deserves?   Sutter:  I do find that frustrating. I'm not sure people on the mainland realize how severe the crisis has been -- and continues to be.  In March, I was  reporting a story  on people in a remote town, Maunabo, where people were dying because they lacked basic services like electricity. Breathing machines weren't working. People couldn't get medical help. There was just this cloud of despair that hung over the place.  I worried that our readers might not get it -- or might not care, that they'd be focused on a Trump tweet. PR is part of the United States -- but it can feel like living on another planet down here. The experiences people are having, and that we're reporting, don't translate for many Americans.  I also worry the crisis here will be forgotten because it will stop shocking people -- that they'll feel like they already know that Puerto Rico is suffering and they'd rather tune it out. I sincerely hope that doesn't happen. I do think CNN has done an amazing job at continuing to put people/resources on this story.    Santiago:  Of course, I want this story to get more air time. It deserves it. These are US citizens on the island, and  people are still dying  due to lack of power.  This is also the island I call home. So for me, this is personal. I want to make sure everyone knows what is, and is not, happening here (especially in areas outside of San Juan). That said, I am very proud of the work coming from CNN teams on this island.    Kaur:  Why does it feel like Americans on the mainland don't care?   Sutter:  I do think Americans care. Friends and colleagues are always asking me about what's happening here -- there's been an outpouring of donations and such. But it's way too easy to treat Puerto Rico like ""that island over there."" To not view the disaster here the same way you'd look at hurricane recovery in Florida.  I'm also frustrated by the ways in which American politics ignores Puerto Rico. People here are US citizens, as Leyla mentioned, but they can't vote for the president, and they don't have voting representatives in Congress. We've designed a system that sticks this place in a sort of unfair limbo.   Santiago:  I think people do care. I get messages and tweets all the time saying so.  I also think they forget. It's been more than 8 months now. It certainly sounds like enough time to recover. And, I think most people assume that is what has happened. Progress has been made.  Power has been restored  for more than 99% of customers (according to the power authority). But, that still leaves more than 11,000 US citizens in the dark.  I talked to the mayor of Corozal today. He told me 20-25% of his residents still have tarps or some sort of temporary roof over their homes. I don't think people realize how many people are still struggling to live their daily lives with just running water and power -- basic things EIGHT months after María. I can't tell you how many people on the island still tell me they feel forgotten or abandoned.   Kaur:  You both visited funeral homes around Puerto Rico and found months ago that the hurricane death toll was likely much higher than the official count. A  study that published this week  estimated that more than 4,600 people died. Did that surprise you at all?   Sutter:  I wasn't all that surprised, sadly. In our  November investigation , we surveyed 112 funeral homes -- about half those on the island here. And funeral home directors/staff told us they'd identified 499 probable hurricane deaths. That's certainly not 4,600. But it's far higher than the current official death toll from Puerto Rico officials: 64.  I don't think we'll ever know the exact toll. Harvard admits that, too. But it's far higher than has been officially recognized. That matters. Because these are real people with real families who passed away. They deserve to be remembered. Their families also are eligible for certain types of FEMA aid if their deaths are classified as ""official.""  Experts keep telling us that death toll figures drive attention/aid/government response after hurricanes. If the public had known this 4,600 figure sooner -- who knows what would be different now.   Santiago:  I don't find those numbers surprising. BUT we also have to be careful with the numbers from the study.  I think most people think Harvard found 4,600 cases of Hurricane María related deaths. That's not what happened here. They visited about 100 barrios, interviewed about 10,000 people. Based on the trends identified they believe 4,600 is a conservative estimate.  The doctors I've talked to tell me lack of power is absolutely taking a toll on healthcare. We did our investigation in November. When we checked in with funeral homes again February, I was appalled to hear people were STILL dying because of lack of power. I believe the number of indirect deaths is much higher than what is currently counted.  And the death toll is important. If we don't know who died, where and how, we have no way of possibly preventing it in the future. Kaur:  Is it hard to get data?   Santiago:  YES!   Sutter:  Second that! Very hard. That's partly why we surveyed so many funeral homes -- at a time when communications systems were mostly down. It's partly why Harvard did that MASSIVE survey. And it's why CNN is suing PR's Demographic Registry (with CPI, an investigative journalism organization here in Puerto Rico) for death records.  The Puerto Rican  government  did commission  George Washington University  to do a review of the death toll. That review is still forthcoming, and has been delayed. But the government here has been very reluctant to share documents and records about what's happened. And I think it's fair to say that the Maria death toll has become a highly sensitive and politically charged issue.   Kaur:  Leyla, you were born in Puerto Rico. You spent summers on the island and even got married there. Has your  connection to Puerto Rico  made this assignment more challenging? Has it changed how you approach the story? How has it changed you?   Santiago:  How much time do we have?   I have always been proud to call this home. This island is my happy place :) When you see so much devastation, destruction and desperation ... of course it affects you. I cried quite a bit in the weeks after María. I cried when I watched a cruise ship filled with Puerto Ricans with specials needs leaving the island. I cried when I found my family for the first time (nine days after María). I cried when I saw the blue tarps flying in last week.  I understand it is my job as a journalist, and a Puerto Rican, to give the people of this island a voice. This island molded me into the person I am today. I owe it to them.   Kaur:  John, you covered climate change for a long time. Are there connections you're drawing between that and everything that's unfolded in Puerto Rico?   Sutter:  It's one of the reasons I wanted to cover this storm.  The standard disclaimer is that it's tricky to link any one storm/flood/etc. to climate change (Scientists are actually getting better at this). But we do know that this storm looks a lot like climate change. We know seas are rising, which influences the height of storm surge. We know oceans are warming. We know more water in the atmosphere can create more-intense rains. And we know that people are messing with all those systems -- fundamentally making them more dangerous -- because we've refused or been unable to stop burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests.  I'm very troubled by the new moral matrix this creates: In a world where so many storms/weather events are supercharged by climate change -- by us -- who is to blame for the catastrophe that follows? It's getting much harder to look at any weather events as fully ""natural,"" because they're occurring in a climate system we've altered.  Maybe that all sounds wonky. But climate change is all about risk. And we're making the planet riskier because we continue to burn fossil fuels at such an astounding rate.   Kaur:  What is the one thing you each hear from people over and over?   Sutter:  ""No es fácil,"" or ""It's not easy."" My sense is that many people here are disinclined to complain about what they're going through. They're just trying to survive. Helping each other. Doing what they can. Some are resigned to a new normal -- without power, etc. In those places people always use that phrase. I take it as code for a sense of hopelessness.    Santiago:  I called 8 mayors across the island. When I asked them what the biggest issue would be if another storm headed toward the island, the answer was unanimous: the power grid.  Among the people you'll often hear, ""No es fácil."" It means, ""It's not easy."" It's how they describe life after María. Many feel forgotten. Many feel hopeless. Many feel they're not treated like US citizens.   Kaur:  Is the situation there hopeless? Will Puerto Rico ever be the same?   Santiago:  I think in some ways Puerto Rico is forever changed. The way people live their lives and the way they respond to disaster will never be the same. But I also think Puerto Rico will one day become a  resilient island  again. It will take a lot of time. It will take a lot of help. It will take a lot of money.   Sutter:  It's not hopeless, but it feels it at times.  The island is hemorrhaging people and has been for years; it has an extremely low birthrate; child poverty is sky-high; and the debt crisis has in many ways crippled the economy, forcing a range of austerity measures. Plus Maria.  Some people here have lost hope, at least temporarily. I certainly hope it's not permanent -- because Puerto Rico truly is a place of incredible beauty and strength and potential.   Santiago:  Amen.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/02/us/on-the-ground-in-puerto-rico-qa/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3ic6x3sj6AhXCSTABHV8GB-s4eBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw26zEG9ZY_yYxwRbl5bjne4,CNN,Liberal
95,Puerto Rico seeks to delay releasing death records after hurricane; judge rejects motion,John D. Sutter,6/12/18," Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló  told CNN last month that there would be ""hell to pay""  if officials withheld records related to  Hurricane Maria .  Yet his government filed a motion late Monday asking for permission to stall the delivery of death certificates and other data a judge had ordered to be released to CNN and the Center for Investigative Journalism, or CPI, after the organizations sued for access to those records.   In response, the court said it would not lift its requirement that records be released to CNN and CPI by Tuesday. ""This new delay tactic (speaks) to the Rosselló government's credibility,"" said Carla Minet, executive director of CPI. ""The government didn't need seven days to hand in most of the information -- and yet they haven't delivered anything at this point, even when they publicly stated that they would comply with the court.""   ""Transparency is a word they just don't understand,"" she added.  CNN and CPI planned to file motions in opposition to the government's request for delay.  The news organizations planned to meet with government attorneys at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. The judge asked to be notified of the results of that meeting by 5 p.m. on Wednesday.  The organizations sued for death certificates and databases in February after officials from the Puerto Rican Demographic Registry refused to provide the documents. The records and data relate to CNN and CPI's independent investigations of the death toll from Hurricane Maria, which  evidence suggests is substantially higher  than officials have reported.   The Puerto Rican judge on June 4 had  ordered the US commonwealth to release, within seven days, death certificates, death databases, burial permits and other records  to CNN and CPI. Ramón Rosario, Puerto Rico's secretary of public affairs and public policy, issued a statement the following day saying the government would comply with the court order, adding that it is the government's policy is to ""work with strict transparency and facilitate access to all public information.""   With the deadline for delivery of those records approaching, however, Puerto Rico on Monday filed a motion asking the court to lift the seven-day requirement for the delivery of the records.  Puerto Rico's motion had asked the court to consider the volume of the records request and difficult circumstances facing the US commonwealth's government, including budget cuts, personnel shortages and austerity measures brought about both by the hurricane and the debt crisis that had crippled Puerto Rico in the years before the storm.   ""Reaffirming our work to faithfully comply with the judgment in this case, we understand that the seven days granted to the state are not enough to accomplish this process that we're just starting,"" wrote Wanda Vázquez Garced, secretary of justice, and other officials.  Puerto Rico wishes to maintain the ""highest level of transparency,"" the motion said.   In a statement issued Tuesday, Puerto Rican authorities said they would begin to release some information to CNN and CPI that same day. Officials did not specify which information and maintained they needed more time to process records. ""(W)e have invested all of our resources and efforts in complying with the order, however we must be extremely careful with the information we are sharing and understand that (the) court was clear in that we should protect sensitive information such as people's social security numbers,"" said Dr. Rafael Rodríguez Mercado, Puerto Rico's secretary of health. ""So it will be necessary to request more time to protect the deceased and their families and comply with each of the instructions given to us."" Experts say Puerto Rico does not have a clear public records law, meaning that journalists and others seeking public information must sometimes sue in order to obtain it.  ""It's totally contradictory"" for the government to ask for a delay while claiming it would comply with the judge's order, said Javier Villa, news director of Radio Universidad, a radio station affiliated with the University of Puerto Rico. ""It appears the government doesn't want the public and the press to know what is going on -- and (that) they are trying to delay this.""  Puerto Rico fought the release of these records in court, arguing that at least some parts of the records should be kept private out of concern for the privacy of the deceased.    Meanwhile, the governor touted Puerto Rico's approach to government transparency in a  May 31 interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper .  Cooper asked Rosselló why officials would not provide death records to the Harvard University researchers who were conducting an assessment of Maria's death toll.    ""If it's true, Anderson, you know, there will be hell to pay,"" Rosselló said. ""Because I really want this to be very transparent. I want the truth to come out. That's the bottom line. And I want us to learn from this tragedy, so that we can prevent in the future something like this happening.""   The lawsuits by CNN and CPI follow the accumulation of evidence suggesting Puerto Rico's official death toll for Hurricane Maria, which stands at 64, is a vast underestimation.   In November,  CNN surveyed 112 funeral homes across the island , about half the total. Funeral home directors and staff identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related.  Several months after the storm,  CNN found people were still dying in remote parts of Puerto Rico without access to electricity , hospitals and other basic services.   In May, researchers from Harvard and elsewhere published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine claiming an estimated  4,645 people may have died in the storm . That estimate was based on interviews with more than 3,000 households across Puerto Rico.

96,Puerto Rico releases records of deaths since Hurricane Maria to CNN and another news organization,John D. Sutter,6/12/18," The Puerto Rican government on Tuesday released to CNN and another news organization a database of information on all deaths that occurred after Hurricane Maria, which pummeled this US commonwealth on September 20.   Officials had attempted to stall on the delivery of this information, filing a motion on Monday asking a court to vacate a requirement that the data be delivered by Tuesday.   A judge rejected that motion and officials on Tuesday turned over a database containing information on all the thousands of people who died in Puerto Rico after the storm. Additionally, officials said they planned to make 24,000 death certificates available within five business days. They planned to make 1,000 of those death certificates available to journalists on Tuesday.  CNN and the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) in Puerto Rico sued the Puerto Rican government in February for death certificates and other records following Hurricane Maria.   CNN plans to use the records to further investigate deaths that followed that storm. The data will include many deaths that occurred after the storm but were unrelated to Hurricane Maria.  The network intends to post all of the names online in a searchable database and to ask its audience to help investigate which of the deaths were related to the storm. Puerto Rico's official toll from the storm is only 64 dead; evidence suggests many times that number of people may have died in the storm and its chaotic aftermath.   It may never be possible to know the actual toll of Hurricane Maria, but this data could yield new clarity about who died in the protracted aftermath of the storm. Millions remained without power in Puerto Rico for months, far longer than after other recent US storms.  The Puerto Rican government had argued much of this documentation should be kept secret out of concern for the privacy of people who died in the aftermath of the hurricane.  While his government fought in court to keep these records private, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló argued publicly that commonwealth authorities were promoting transparency,  telling CNN's Anderson Cooper there would be ""hell to pay"" if records were withheld .   ""I really want this to be very transparent,"" the governor said in that May 31 interview. ""I want the truth to come out. That's the bottom line. And I want us to learn from this tragedy.""  Government attorneys on Tuesday asked journalists from CNN and CPI to sign a document saying that, ""With the delivery of this information the recipient acknowledges the confidential character of the information delivered, and that wrongful management of this information could imply violations to the penal code of Puerto Rico and other laws."" The journalists refused and officials agreed to release the information without that requirement.  Rosselló in February announced  Puerto Rico had hired George Washington University to investigate the death toll . An initial review was expected in late May but has not been released.  Puerto Rico -- a US commonwealth where residents are US citizens but cannot vote for president and don't have a voting representative in Congress -- does not have a clear public records law, experts say. That means that journalists and researchers seeking information the government does not want to release often file lawsuits in order to obtain public records.   The toll initially came under scrutiny  after US President Donald Trump visited the island in October  and praised the relatively small death toll from the storm, then 16.   That figure jumped to 34 after Trump left Puerto Rico, later that day.   In October,  CNN highlighted uncounted deaths in one town . In November,  the network surveyed 112 funeral homes across the island  -- about half the total -- and found that funeral home directors and staff believed at least 499 people had died for reasons related to the storm and its aftermath. That investigation prompted an immediate response from the Puerto Rican government, which  ""implored"" funeral home directors to come forward with information .   Two deaths  were added to the official tally following CNN's reporting .  Subsequently, academics and journalists analyzed aggregate death data for the months after the hurricane and compared that to the total number of deaths during that time in previous years. Researchers found that about  1,000 ""excess deaths""  appear to have occurred in the months after the storm.   In March,  CNN reported that people in Maunabo, Puerto Rico -- a community that was largely without power almost six months after the storm -- were still dying without access to basic services . Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, 77, died in January, for example, after waking up unable to breathe. The family couldn't afford to run a generator to power his breathing machine.   Experts criticized the federal and Puerto Rican government's response to the storm as slow and questioned whether these deaths would have occurred if services had been restored sooner.  ""It's unconscionable and unreasonable that it has taken so long"" to restore power, Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said at the time. ""You have to ask yourself, 'why is that?' It's money and politics, the common denominator for so many things. ... Can you imagine no (electric) power in Beaumont or Port Arthur or Rockport, Texas, for this amount of time? I don't care what kind of disaster it was. You would never see this.""  Federal officials have said they responded to the crisis in Puerto Rico as they would to any disaster on the US mainland and that logistical challenges presented by the Caribbean island -- its remoteness, the impassability of its roads, the poor state of its infrastructure before the storm -- slowed down efforts to restore electricity and other basic services. Although power had been restored to nearly all customers, according to Puerto Rican authorities,  thousands remained without power on the island in early June , more than eight months after Maria.  On May 29, researchers from  Harvard University and other institutions published the results of an extensive survey  that showed anywhere from 793 up to 8,498 people may have died because of the storm and the chaotic aftermath, which included, for many, months without power or medical services. That report prompted activists and academics from Puerto Rico to mobilize around the hashtag #4645boricuas, using one of the numbers in the range that the study cited and the term commonly associated with people from the island.  Days later, people brought  more than 1,500 shoes representing victims of the storm  to the steps of the Puerto Rican capitol in a silent, public memorial for the unnamed dead.

97,Puerto Rico ordered to release death records,John D. Sutter,6/5/18," The Puerto Rican government has seven days to release death certificates and related data to CNN and a local journalism organization investigating the true toll of Hurricane Maria, a Puerto Rican judge ruled Monday.  The decision comes amid controversy over the US territory's handling of the official death toll from the hurricane, which battered this Caribbean island on September 20.  Puerto Rico had argued that some information contained in death certificates should be kept private in order to protect the identities of the dead. Puerto Rico Superior Court Judge Lauracelis Roques Arroyo ruled these records are a matter of public information and must be released, with the exception of the social security numbers of the deceased.  CNN and the  Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI)  in Puerto Rico sued for access to death records. Both organizations have published  extensive investigations questioning Puerto Rico's official death toll , which is 64.  Data about Hurricane Maria deaths has been the Puerto Rican government's ""best kept secret,"" with officials blocking journalists and academics from obtaining basic mortality data, said Carla Minet, executive director of the Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico.

Ricardo) Rosselló to finally deliver the information without further excuses."" Puerto Rico said Tuesday that it will release the data. The government's policy is to ""work with strict transparency and facilitate access to all public information, so we will be complying with what was recently ordered by the court,"" Ramón Rosario, Puerto Rico's secretary of public affairs and public policy, said in a statement. In November,  CNN surveyed 112 funeral homes across the island , about half the total, and found that funeral home directors and staff identified at least 499 deaths they believed to be hurricane-related.  A Harvard study published last week, which was based on interviews with more than 3,000 households, suggested the true  death toll may be more than 4,600 .  Puerto Rico this year hired George Washington University to review Maria's death toll. Officials have said they welcomed Harvard's assessment and want to know how many died in the storm and its aftermath.

98,Puerto Ricans lost to Hurricane Maria remembered as new reports question low death toll,Jason Hanna and Leyla Santiago,6/2/18," Puerto Ricans laid out hundreds of shoes Saturday in front of the US territory's Capitol in a makeshift memorial to those killed by Hurricane Maria -- wrapping up a week in which two reports brought fresh questions about how many people died from last year's devastating storm. Residents placed more than 1,600 pairs of shoes in front of the building, some with notes and flowers honoring one or more people. Visitors hugged one another, or looked on in tears. Emma Rodriguez sobbed when she arrived with Alberto Martinez. They came from Aguadilla, and left shoes for Jonathan Goitia and Abner DeJesus. DeJesus had a medical condition that worsened after Maria, when he couldn't get medical attention he needed. Goitia, Rodriguez said, was found dead in his home. ""I can smell the death. This is death,""  Rodriguez said. Most people left written messages with the shoes, such as, "" You will rejoice when you see me in the place that no eye has seen ..."" and "" Today I am lending your shoes for a cause ."" And some mourners expressed anger. ""Donald Trump had the nerve to say this wasn't that big of a deal compared to (Hurricane) Katrina,"" Arturo Alvarez said. ""There are no words to describe how disrespectful it was"" for him to say that. ""Now is the time to say goodbye to the relatives, is the time (for) sorrow, is the time to hug each other,"" memorial organizer Gloribel Delgado told CNN. ""So it's the time to really say a goodbye in honor and dignity."" University of Puerto Rico professor Rafael Acevedo is credited with coming up with the idea for the shoe memorial. Delgado said the shoes will be left out until Sunday, then moved to other municipalities hurt by the storm.' The memorial came as a controversy swirls over  the government's official death toll of 64  from the storm that slammed into the Caribbean island on September 20. On Friday, the US commonwealth's government released data showing deaths on the island spiked sharply around the time Hurricane Maria hit -- perhaps dovetailing with assertions that the official storm death toll is far too low. The data show an increase of 1,431 overall deaths on Puerto Rico in September, October and November 2017 compared with the same three months a year earlier, and a jump of 1,720 deaths compared with the same three months in 2015. However, the raw data released Friday by the island's demographic registry does not specify causes of death -- so it is unclear how much of the spike could be related to the storm. The data release comes days after a  Harvard University study  estimated that 4,645 people died from Maria and its aftermath -- 70 times greater than the island's official death toll. CNN and other news outlets have used government statistics and extensive interviews with families of the deceased and funeral home directors to  question the Puerto Rican government's official tally of deaths .  CNN and  the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI)  in Puerto Rico are suing the island's demographic registry for access to death records that have been withheld.  On Thursday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said he did not stand by the official death toll, and that he welcomed the Harvard study results. But he said his government did the best it could with information-gathering protocol available at the time.  ""We had established that this number was going to be much, much higher than what we had as an official tally,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper.  ""It's not sticking with the number. It was just establishing that the process that we had prior led us to that number, which is what we got from doctors and death certificates."" Maria wiped out Puerto Rico's power grid, leaving the entire island in the dark in September. While most power and water service has been restored, thousands of people remain without electricity more than eight months after the storm hit.  CNN's Leyla Santiago reported from San Juan, and CNN's Jason Hanna wrote and reported in Atlanta.

99,"Still mending Maria's mess, Puerto Rico braces for a new hurricane season",Leyla Santiago and Jason Kravarik,6/1/18," Sitting outside his one-room home, Miguel Angel Vera Gonzalez admits he may get old, but the view does not.  With his legs crossed, and a hat bearing the Puerto Rican flag atop his head, the thin 83-year-old man looks out at the mountains he has always called home. The landscape brings Vera a sense of tranquility. That peace is interrupted by the hum of a machine that sits just a few feet away. It's a power generator that Vera depends on to power the device he uses four times a day to cope with his asthma. He's one of 11,000 US citizens living without power eight months after Hurricane Maria slammed into the island. The Category 4 storm wiped out the US territory's power grid, leaving the entire island in the dark in September.  ""I don't know. I have no answer for that,"" Vera responds when asked when he expects to have his power restored. Miguel Angel Vera Gonzalez spends much of his day sitting outside his front door and enjoying the views. His Utuado home still doesn't have power With the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane season under way as of Friday, the desperation among those still without power had led some to take deadly risks to get it back. ""We feel abandoned,"" said Charley Reyes from atop a power pole on a winding street in the hills of Utuado. He's restoring power to his neighbors -- more than a dozen so far -- even though he has no experience in working with electrical lines. Using empty water bottles to encase wires he shouldn't touch and as neighbors watch from the ground, Reyes cuts, scrapes and ties off wires with bold confidence -- surprising since he had only a one-day crash course in power restoration from a retired power worker. ""You see it in the eyes of the people, the frustration,"" said Utuado's mayor, Ernesto Irizarry. ""Every day I go and start the day and talk to God: 'Lend me the power and the mind.'"" The mayors  Irizarry says he doesn't feel his city is prepared for another storm -- and he's far from alone.  When CNN contacted the mayors of Utuado, Arroyo, Bayamon, San Juan, Añasco, Salinas and Toa Baja, they agreed the vulnerable power grid would be the biggest issue if the island were hit soon.  None of the mayors confidently told CNN they were fully prepared for the next storm. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin and Bayamon Mayor Ramon Luis Rivera both said they were ""as prepared as can be,"" given the island's vulnerability.  ""If I told you we were ready, that would be a lie,"" said Arroyo Mayor Eric Bachier Roman. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects the season, which began June 1, to be  ""near-or above normal""  -- but not to the same degree seen last year. Bachier Roman, and Rivera, quickly pointed out that municipalities are still in recovery mode. An aerial view reveals hundreds of homes still depending on blue tarps to provide shelter in homes. While the US Army Corps of Engineers has completed the majority of debris removal, the cleanup continues.  While Arroyo is back to 100% in power restoration, its mayor said to be prepared for another storm, he would need to be able to depend on the water, generators, communication and relief supplies he currently does not have.   ""We need much more,"" says Toa Baja Mayor Betito Marquez Garcia.  Marquez Garcia hopes to have six sirens fully installed by the end of June, possibly early July. He believes the communication tool could be valuable if another storm wipes out all communication again as Maria did. A 'weak or fragile' power grid  Should another hurricane hit Puerto Rico, there is one certainty: its power grid will collapse.  ""I think the most honest thing to say about our grid is that it's weak or fragile,"" said Walt Higgins, the new CEO of the Puerto Rico Power Authority (PREPA), in an interview with CNN. Puerto Rico has faced the longest lasting power outage in modern US history, according to FEMA. Neighbors from Paso Palmas community use old power lines found on the side of the road and splice them together to run new lines of power.  Most of the island currently has power, and among the thousands still waiting for it, Higgins says says most, though not all, should be able to turn lights back on within the next three to four weeks.   While they've been working on power restoration for months, Higgins admits, PREPA officials are still trying to identify who doesn't have power.  The bigger challenge, however, is rebuilding a power grid that was never built to withstand a category 4 or 5 hurricane under a power authority that is $9 billion in debt.  Just weeks ago, an  island-wide blackout  was caused by a fallen tree, according to PREPA.  ""There is a lot to do. Anybody that ever goes into an emergency thinking they've got it under control is wrong,"" Higgins told CNN.  If a storm were to move toward Puerto Rico today, Higgins said PREPA is more prepared than it was for Hurricane Maria because hundreds of more crews are on the ground, and more are on the way.  ""There's no magic wand. There's no silver bullet,"" he said. ""You just day by day, by day, have to do all the things it takes so that over time PREPA will become the utility that the customers want here."" FEMA: Faster response next time  Showing off a warehouse full of supplies in San Juan, FEMA Federal Coordination Officer Mike Byrne stands by the agency's initial response to Hurricane Maria. The FEMA Public Assistance Program has committed $2.4 billion in funding for emergency protective measures and debris removal in Puerto Rico, according to FEMA. Byrne admits there is room for improvement. ""Absolutely. No doubt. No doubt,"" he insists when asked if FEMA will be ready for a faster response in the event of another hurricane on the island.  A big difference planned for future response, he explains, is more stockpiling of relief supplies. Compared to Hurricane Maria preparations, FEMA plans to have 6.5 times more water, six times more generators, and eight times more tarps. They've also outlined a distribution plan to get the supplies to residents in need, something that hampered the recovery after Maria. Emergency plans, drills while residents wait, wonder As the government of Puerto Rico touts emergency management plans and upcoming island-wide drills, it's also been forced to acknowledge mistakes and lessons learned from the response to Hurricane Maria.   After CNN asked about specific changes for potential disasters in the future, Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rosello, pointed to  plans to immediately call for mutual aid assistance in power restoration . After Maria, Puerto Rico waited more than a month to make the request. The governor is also questioning the method of counting deaths, after a new  Harvard study  and a  CNN investigation. Luis Miguel Vera Romero is still using a generator to power his father's nebulizer machine, the device he needs to cope with asthma. Harvard researchers believe 70 times more people than what Puerto Rico's government reported have died as a result of Hurricane Maria. Based on trends researchers found after surveying more than 100 barrios, or neighborhoods, across the island and talking to 10,000 people, Harvard researchers believe Hurricane Maria claimed the lives of at least 4,600 people. The official Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico stands at 64.  ""There really is no real logical explanation for us wanting to pin down the numbers."" We want the real number to come out. We had a protocol that was sub-par and we recognize it, and now toward the future we want to make sure that its effective and can be a model for other nations, as well,"" Gov. Rosello said during a press conference in San Juan. As federal and local officials try to identify ways to improve coordination for the next storm, Puerto Ricans, like Vera, are left to wait and wonder.  As Vera waits on his front porch, his hope is power will return before the next storm comes.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/01/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-readiness/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiD2rWx6cj6AhW2RzABHStdD5g45gEQFnoECAMQAg&usg=AOvVaw2kv6sex572Oc6PXCf5uvKv,CNN,Liberal
100,Puerto Rico's governor says there will be 'hell to pay' if officials withheld mortality data,Emanuella Grinberg,6/1/18," Puerto Rico's governor defended his government's efforts to account for deaths on the island following Hurricane Maria after a new study called the official tally a ""substantial underestimate.""  The official death toll in Puerto Rico has been the subject of substantial controversy since Hurricane Maria hit the island, a US territory, on September 20. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said he welcomed the  results of a Harvard study  published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Researchers surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen households across the island and compared it to official mortality statistics from 2016. They concluded that an estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico -- almost 70 times the government's official tally of 64. Rosselló said he does not stand by the official death toll. But he said his government did the best it could with information-gathering protocol available to them at the time.  ""We had established that this number was going to be much, much higher than what we had as an official tally,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It's not sticking with the number. It was just establishing that the process that we had prior led us to that number, which is what we got from doctors and death certificates."" CNN and other news outlets have used government statistics and extensive interviews with families of the deceased and funeral home directors to question the Puerto Rican government's official tally of deaths. Previous estimates suggested Maria contributed to about 1,000 deaths. Rosselló cited the government's commissioning of a study to be carried out by George Washington University as a sign of its intentions to reach an accurate number. He acknowledged that the GW study is behind schedule and blamed the delay on the difficulty of obtaining accurate data from death certificates. He said he hoped the results of the GW study, along with the Harvard survey results, could inform decision-making about how to handle similar catastrophes.  One researcher who worked on the Harvard study told CNN that the Puerto Rican government did not provide them with data they requested. Rosselló said there would be ""hell to pay"" if officials from his government were found to be withholding mortality statistics from researchers. ""I really want this to be very transparent. I want the truth to come out. That's the bottom line. And I want us to learn from this tragedy.""

101,Puerto Rico will be an enduring stain on Trump's presidency,Gregory Krieg,5/31/18," Two days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, President Donald Trump was busy kicking up a storm of his own.  Speaking in Alabama on Friday night, September 22, 2017, Trump took aim at the small group of NFL players who were kneeling, during the national anthem, as a protest against racial injustice. Team owners, he said, should be meeting their demonstrations with calls to ""get that son of a bitch off the field right now,"" adding theatrically: ""He's fired!""  As the President blustered and baited, Puerto Rico suffered. According to the official count, 64 people died during and after the ravenous storm. That estimate was always assumed to be on the low end, but a new, independent study published this week in  The New England Journal of Medicine  has brought to bear something closer to the true depths of the tragedy. In their report, researchers from Harvard and other institutions placed the toll much higher, at more than 4,600 lives.  One-third of the fatalities, the study found, ""were reported by household members as being caused by delayed or prevented access to medical care."" The magnitude of loss on the island -- and the continued suffering of both the people still there and those forced to flee -- will be a stain on the Trump administration that outlasts its time in Washington, a searing reminder of what's at risk when a society and its leaders reveal themselves to be unequipped, in every sense, to contend with a real disaster.  The new report is the latest in a series of more thorough, independent investigations into the storm's devastation. Last year,  a CNN survey  of Puerto Rican funeral homes, counting deaths from September 20 through October 19, put the number of those believed to be storm-related at 499. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on November 3, offered a similar estimate. By then, the initial shock and panicked relief efforts had passed. Reporters like  CNN's Leyla Santiago  kept close, but the news cycle never stopped spinning.  During the first two weeks after hurricane struck, Trump's Twitter feed featured a maddening mix of exhortations to vote in the Alabama special election primary, best wishes to the people caught in Maria's path, jabs at Republicans who opposed another failed Obamacare repeal push, tributes to FEMA and first responders, and repeated potshots at pro football players. Over time, as situation in Puerto Rico deteriorated and the administration faced criticism for its response, Trump turned bitter.       On September 25, he turned his ire on the island itself.  ""Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,"" he said in  the first   of a series   of three tweets . ""It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars ... owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well."" A day later, with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy looking on, Trump talked up the administration's ""massive"" efforts in the region, praised Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló for praising him, and explained — as if it were some newly discovered wonder — that rescue and recovery work in Puerto Rico was more complicated than in places like Texas because ""it's on an island in the middle of the ocean. It's out in the ocean. You can't just drive your trucks there from other states."" Excuses in place, Trump by September 30 had settled on a villain. He leveled  a series of attacks  against Cruz, the San Juan mayor, in response to her criticism of the White House's relief work, as many on the island waited on help without power or access to clean water and medical aid. ""The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,""  Trump tweeted  early that morning. ""They,""  he added , naming the mayor and  ""others in Puerto Rico,""  ""want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort."" In an interview later that day with Orlando television station WKMG, Vice President Mike Pence  echoed Trump's complaints , calling it ""frustrating"" for ""millions of Americans to hear rhetoric coming out from some in Puerto Rico, particularly the mayor of San Juan, instead of focusing on results."" A few days later, Trump visited Puerto Rico, where he made a show of tossing paper towel rolls, like he was playing pop-a-shot basketball, to a crowd and compared the number of dead favorably -- ""Sixteen people versus in the thousands"" -- to what followed ""a real catastrophe"" like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""That was a terrific visit,"" he told reporters on the flight home, ""that visit was terrific.""",https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/politics/puerto-rico-death-toll-trump-legacy/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiD2rWx6cj6AhW2RzABHStdD5g45gEQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw0Moy_L_nE_efssdZtCRjx6,CNN,Liberal
45,Hurricane Maria's Death Toll In Puerto Rico 70 Times Higher Than Official Estimates: Study,Hayley Miller,5/29/18,"Over 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria ― more than 70 times the official death toll ― according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday.The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found Hurricane Maria left at least 4,645 people dead in Puerto Rico after the storm made landfall on the island on Sept. 20, 2017. This figure stands in stark contrast with the Puerto Rican government’s official tally of 64. The Harvard researchers conducted a survey of 3,299 randomly chosen households across Puerto Rico, in which participants were asked about displacement, infrastructure loss and causes of death.Interruption of medical care was the primary cause of the increase in mortality rates in the months after the hurricane, according to the study. Researchers said their 4,645 estimate is “likely to be conservative” and the death toll may actually exceed 5,000. Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, told PBS that he was not surprised that the death toll was likely higher than 64. He said his agency had commissioned George Washington University to conduct a study on the number of hurricane fatalities and that its results would be released soon.“As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities,” Mercader wrote in a statement. “We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported.”Trump repeatedly downplayed Hurricane Maria’s disastrous toll on Puerto Rico in the months following the storm. During an October visit to the island, Trump said Hurricane Maria wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina, which left over 1,800 dead. At the time, Puerto Rico’s official death toll for Hurricane Maria was 16.“Sixteen versus literally thousands of people,” Trump said at the time. “You can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s been taking place in Puerto Rico.”During the same trip, he bizarrely tossed paper towels to local residents and lamented how much federal money was being spent on the disaster relief efforts.“I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack — because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that’s fine, we’ve saved a lot of lives,” Trump told local officials at an airport hangar in Puerto Rico.A representative from the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Harvard study.Puerto Rico officials, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, had begged the federal government to increase rescue and relief efforts, accusing Trump of turning his back on fellow Americans.Trump responded by calling Cruz “nasty” and claiming her accusations were politically motivated. “It took too long to understand the need for an appropriate response was NOT about politics but about saving lives,” Cruz tweeted Tuesday in response to the Harvard study.This is a developing story.

44,Harvard Study On Puerto Rico Is Devastating For More Reasons Than The Alarmingly High Death Toll,Carolina Moreno,5/29/18,"Puerto Rico’s death toll in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria is estimated to be almost 5,000, according to a Harvard study published Tuesday. Data from this large-scale survey also revealed some sobering information about what life has been like for those trying to manage their health on the island in the wake of the storm. The study, which surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen households in Puerto Rico over three weeks, found that from Sept. 20 to Dec. 31, 2017, at least 4,645 people died in connection to the storm. The government’s death toll is 64. Dr. Satchit Balsari, one of the researchers for the study, explained the importance of having an accurate death count not only because of its financial ramifications but also because it gives families a sense of closure. “It’s important to acknowledge what happened and why they lost their family members,” he told reporters in a conference call on Tuesday. Researchers calculated this new alarmingly high death toll and gathered facts about causes of death, displacement and infrastructure loss in the months after the storm. The information paints a distressing picture of the sort of challenges that millions of Puerto Ricans faced after Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in September of last year. The study’s numbers aligned with previous media reports and analyses that the death toll was likely in the thousands. The researchers’ findings are dismaying but, unfortunately, are surprising only in their magnitude. The aftermath of the storm was deadlier than its landfall The survey found that the significant increase in deaths in the months after Hurricane Maria was mainly a result of interruption of medical care, with about one-third of households reporting such issues — including accessing medications (14.4 percent), being unable to use respiratory equipment because of a lack of electricity (9.5 percent), having no open medical facilities nearby (8.6 percent) or having no doctors at medical facilities (6.1 percent).Nearly 9 percent of households in remote areas said they were unable to reach 911 services by phone. Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York, said he knows the numerous health struggles people face after a disaster.“I think people gravitate towards how many people were killed immediately from drowning or falling debris,” he said. “But the reality is, the much, much bigger problem is the long-term inability to get to medical care or the inability to get the medical devices or medication that people need to survive — so, people who are dependent on electrical-powered medical devices like ventilators or who need their medication every single day so their diabetes or high blood pressure doesn’t get out of control.” The average household went over 2 months without power and waterAfter Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s decades-old power grid was devastated, leaving millions of residents in the dark. For months, access to drinking water and plumbing was compromised by a lack of electricity ― conditions that prompted health concerns over bacterial disease outbreaks, among other fears.A lack of power can be dangerous for people with chronic conditions who rely on electrically powered medical devices or must have a functioning refrigerator to store medicines such as insulin. And the Harvard study found that, on average, households went 84 days without electricity and 68 days without water. Many respondents were still without power at the time the survey was conducted, from Jan. 17 to Feb. 24 this year. Older Puerto Ricans stayed behind while young adults left their homesIn the wake of Hurricane Maria, a historic number of Puerto Ricans have migrated to the mainland to escape deteriorating economic and day-to-day conditions on the island. The Harvard study found that 2.8 percent of sampled households’ residents were reported to no longer live there. The majority moved elsewhere on the island, and 41 percent went to the mainland. The median age of those who left their households and did not return or were missing was 25. Those who stayed in the household or died had a median age of 50. Alice Thomas, a climate displacement program manager for Refugees International, said the organization witnessed these patterns while visiting the island four months and six months after the hurricane hit. “It was very obvious from what we saw on the ground that the people who were being left behind were mainly the elderly,” she said. “We visited a number of households in different parts of the island, both remote and close to San Juan, where it was essentially older people living in a house that didn’t have electricity [or] potable water.”Older people are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions, which often require regular management and may limit their mobility and ability to migrate or travel long distances for treatment. “There were people who had chronic illnesses — including Alzheimer’s, hypertension, high blood pressure, Parkinson’s ― and they were living traumatized by the storm itself,” Thomas added. She said her group’s workers met many people who were poor and did not have health insurance to help pay for what few resources were available. The study likely included a dramatic undercount of suicides As it stands, data from the study included only one suicide. The number linked to Hurricane Maria is likely much higher, since the government’s count includes at least four suicides and separate figures from the government have shown a spike in suicides in the aftermath of the storm. Balsari said the team on the ground consisted entirely of psychology students who had been working on mental health outreach in these communities for a while. “They did find that the prolonged suffering, interruption in their utility services for several months and the interruption in medical care was taking a toll on a higher burden of mental health morbidity,” he said. Dr. Rafael Irizarry, another researcher in the study, chimed in to say he suspected that if the study’s sample size had been larger, they would have seen more suicides. The death toll estimate is conservative and likely much higher Researchers said their estimate of additional deaths from Maria is probably an undercount. “The death rate appears to be constant after September all the way up to December,” Irizarry said in the conference call. “There’s no reason for us to believe that all of a sudden that trailed down after January.”Eight months after the storm, many Puerto Ricans are still without power or reliable access to health care ― a deadly combination for those who remain on the island, particularly in the face of the 2018 hurricane season, which begins Friday. “This is not the end of the story,” Redlener said. “I think there’s every reason to worry that the numbers will climb significantly higher because there are still people without access to the health care they need.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/harvard-study-puerto-rico-death-toll_n_5b0d91d1e4b0568a880f2998,HuffPost,Liberal

Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s been taking place in Puerto Rico.”During the same trip, he bizarrely tossed paper towels to local residents and lamented how much federal money was being spent on the disaster relief efforts.“I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack — because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that’s fine, we’ve saved a lot of lives,” Trump told local officials at an airport hangar in Puerto Rico.A representative from the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Harvard study.Puerto Rico officials, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, had begged the federal government to increase rescue and relief efforts, accusing Trump of turning his back on fellow Americans.Trump responded by calling Cruz “nasty” and claiming her accusations were politically motivated. “It took too long to understand the need for an appropriate response was NOT about politics but about saving lives,” Cruz tweeted Tuesday in response to the Harvard study.This is a developing story.

102,Widespread power outage persists in Puerto Rico,Madison Park and Steve Almasy,4/19/18," In another blow to its recovery efforts, an island-wide power outage left most of Puerto Rico in the dark, with only a fraction of residents regaining electricity by Wednesday night.  The latest blackout prompted Gov. Ricardo Rossello to call on the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to cancel its contract with the subcontractor that caused the massive outage. ""I have suggested to the PREPA Board of Directors that they cancel the contract with the Cobra subcontractor who is directly responsible for this power outage,"" he said in a statement Wednesday. An excavator operated by D. Grimm, a subcontractor for Cobra Acquisitions, apparently caused the blackout, according to the authority. Workers had been removing a fallen tower when the machine got too close to an energized line and an electrical ground fault caused the outage, according to Mammoth Energy, Cobra's parent company.  The same company was responsible for an  outage that affected 870,000 customers  after a tree fell on a power line last week, PREPA said. ""This is the second power failure that has affected the people of Puerto Rico in less than a week,"" Rossello said. ""This incident denotes the need to transform PREPA into a cutting-edge, modern and robust corporation. This is another example of why Puerto Rico's energy infrastructure needs to incorporate new forms of power."" As of 8 p.m. Wednesday, only 334,000 customers in the US commonwealth had electricity again,  according to a tweet from PREPA.  It also said via Twitter that it's working to restore service through the island.  The game must go on  Hours into the blackout, the lights came on at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan for a baseball game between the Minnesota Twins and Cleveland Indians. The Wednesday game lasted 16 innings before a sold-out crowd of 19,537,  according to MLB.com.  Backup systems and mobile tower lights allowed the game to go on as planned, said San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz. ""Playball! Nothing will stop us,"" she tweeted.  Many watched the game then went to homes without electricity.  Power was to be restored to customers who had electricity before the latest outage within 24 to 36 hours, according to PREPA.   Most of the island had had its power restored as Puerto Rico began the process of rebuilding its decimated electrical grid after Hurricane Maria struck in September and knocked out power to nearly 1.4 million customers.  ""Seven months after Maria, we are back where Maria left us,"" Cynthia Garcia Coll, a professor at Carlos Albizu University in San Juan, said via email. Is Puerto Rico ready for hurricane season?  Cruz worried that the latest outage signaled that Puerto Rico won't be prepared for the upcoming hurricane season. ""Our electrical system is weak, at best,"" the mayor said Wednesday. ""Today's blackout makes it painfully obvious that we are not yet ready for the coming hurricane season, which is only 43 days away.""  The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June through November. This season could be a slightly above average one,  according to a preliminary forecast.  ""Today's total power outage in Puerto Rico pinpoints the fact that we are still in a very fragile state,"" she said. ""Moreover, the suffering of the Puerto Rican people seems to be nowhere nearing an end."" Puerto Rico has lost 3.4 billion customer-hours of electricity service due to Maria, according to an analysis released last week by the economic data analytics and policy firm Rhodium Group.  RELATED: Puerto Rico's power outage is now the second-largest blackout in history It's the largest blackout in US history (in terms of customer hours) and the second largest in the world -- after the outage caused when Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people.

46,The Blackout In Puerto Rico Will Likely Happen Again -- And Soon,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,4/19/18,"Puerto Rico was hit by a massive blackout this week, wiping out electricity across the island. And it’s likely just the latest of many more to come, as the U.S. territory continues to recover from Hurricane Maria.On Wednesday,more than 1.4 million people in Puerto Rico found themselves without electricity after a private contractoraccidentally downed a transmission line during restoration work. By Thursday afternoon, power had been restored, according to the Puerto Rican electrical energy authority.However,about 40,000 people who have been without electricity since Hurricane Maria still haven’t gotten their power back seven months later.This week’s blackout was just the latest of several since Hurricane Maria hit in late September, leaving much of the island without power for months. Amajor outage just last week affected more than 800,000 Puerto Rican residents. Another one in Februaryplunged much of San Juan and the northern part of the island into darkness. Anda blackoutin November hit the capital just hours after officials had celebrated restoring 50 percent of the island’s power after Maria.What’s worse, the island remains vulnerable to outages, given thetroubles with Puerto Rico’s power grid even before the storm, thestruggles to restore power to the island since then and the threat of thenext hurricane season, which is typically June to November.“It’ll happen again,” Judith Enck, aformer U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator responsible for Puerto Rico, told HuffPost, speaking of this week’s island-wide blackout. “And likely at that scale.”The power outages have very realconsequences for Puerto Ricans’ daily lives. In the months-long outages in the wake of Hurricane Maria, children’sschooling was interrupted,hospitals were unable to treat patients, and residentsstruggled without being able to use lights, fans and refrigerators.“This situation with the power is driving us crazy,” said Carmen Bonilla Ramos, who lives in the outskirts of Rincon, a town in the western part of the island. Her homedidn’t have power for over four months after Maria.“We don’t know whether to buy meat,” she added, never knowing if the refrigerator will work. “This is the story that never ends. And soon hurricane season is starting, so I don’t have any hope that it will get better.”And Puerto Ricans are already bracing for the next outage.“People were in despair,” Benita Cardona, a resident of Rincon, said of how the blackout affected her neighbors this week. “But after Maria, you always have to be ready.”  “It’s 100 percent going to keep happening,” said Vivienne Miranda, another resident of Rincon. “We hope this inspires some real help to happen ― on a government level.” Several factors have contributed to Puerto Rico’s vulnerability to blackouts in the months since the storm. Even before Maria, the island was struggling with an aging electrical grid ― a system that is 28 years older than the industry average in the rest of the United States, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said in January.  On top of the island’s “rickety old, unreliable electricity system,” as Enck put it, the island’s electrical facilities are virtually all maintained by a single company, PREPA, which is state-owned and operates essentially as a monopoly on the island. And PREPA “does a miserable job across the board,” Enck said. “Even on a bright sunny day with no wind they have problems,” she said. Earlier this year, Rosselló announced a plan to privatize the power company, but the process could take up to 18 months, he estimated, and first it has to get approval from Puerto Rican lawmakers. Some experts have expressed concern about private interests getting involved in the island’s electric utility, including a risk of increased rates for customers. Junck said she’s “keeping an open mind, because PREPA does such a poor job.” Meanwhile, hurricane season is expected to begin in June. High winds and rains from storms could undo much of the progress made to fix fallen utility poles and power lines, not to mention to repair houses and broken roofs.  “Caribbean islands are just sitting ducks,” Junck said. “Climate change is getting worse. They’re going to be hit repeatedly.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-blackouts-electricity-happen-again_n_5ad91cffe4b03c426daccb16,HuffPost,Liberal
47,Puerto Rico Hit By Islandwide Blackout,Dominique Mosbergen,4/18/18,"In what’s been called the second-largest blackout in history, Puerto Rico lost power entirely on Wednesday — marking the second time the island has suffered a major power failure in less than a week. Puerto Rico’s beleaguered power authority blamed the outage on a private contractor who accidentally downed a transmission line during unrelated power restoration work, The Associated Press reported.Officials said it could take between 24 to 36 hours for power to be restored to nearly 1.5 million customers. Restoring power to hospitals, airports, banks and water pumping systems is the first priority, they added. The islandwide outage reflects the continued fragility of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, despite a multi-billion dollar recovery effort underway since Hurricane Maria devastated the island seven months ago. Puerto Rico’s power authority had said earlier Wednesday that electricity had been restored to 97 percent of its customers, The New York Times reported. But just three hours later, the islandwide outage struck.The blackout comes less than a week after a fallen tree knocked out power for about 870,000 customers. “We are becoming a Third World country,” an unidentified resident in the San Juan area told CNN at the time. “Every time this happens we go into PTSD mode.”On Wednesday, Puerto Ricans expressed their exasperation at the continued grid troubles.“This is too much,” Luis Oscar Rivera, whose power was only fully restored less than two months ago, told the AP. “It’s like the first day of Maria all over again.”San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who has been critical of post-Maria recovery efforts, expressed her disdain on Twitter.Lawmakers in Puerto Rico are considering privatizing the island’s embattled and debt-ridden power utility, but there has been some resistance to the idea. In January, the territory’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, said he hoped to sell the utility to the private sector ― a process he said could take about 18 months.“The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,” Rosselló said in a statement. “What we know today [is] the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority does not work and cannot continue to operate like this.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
103,Most of Puerto Rico still without power,Ray Sanchez and Leyla Santiago,4/18/18," With most of Puerto Rico in the dark Wednesday night, Gov. Ricardo Rossello  said in a tweet  that he has suggested Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority cancel its contract with a subcontractor that caused an island-wide power outage.   An excavator operated by D. Grimm, a subcontractor for Cobra Acquisitions, apparently caused the blackout, which originated at a major transmission line running between Salinas and Guayama in the southeast, according to the authority. The same company was responsible for an  outage that affected 870,000 customers  after a tree fell on a power line last week, PREPA said. Mammoth Energy, Cobra's parent company, said workers were removing a fallen tower when the machine got too close to an energized line and an electrical ground fault caused the outage.  As of 8 p.m., only 334,000 customers in the US commonwealth had electricity again. Power was to be restored to customers who had electricity before the latest outage within 24 to 36 hours, the authority said.  This is the latest setback as power officials try to restore power to the nearly 1.4 million customers who lost electric service during Hurricane Maria nearly seven months ago. Most of the island had had its power restored as the commonwealth rebuilt its decimated electrical grid. Hospitals first The utility said its priority Wednesday was to bring back service to medical facilities, water pumping systems and financial institutions. Video and photos posted on social media showed rapid transit line workers helping down passengers from stalled trains and college students registering for classes during the blackout. Long lines of cars formed at gas stations and a fire broke out in an electrical generator behind a restaurant in the Condado tourist district. ""Seven months after Maria, we are back where Maria left us,"" Cynthia Garcia Coll, a professor at Carlos Albizu University in San Juan, said via email.  Rafael Santiago, an engineer at a plant that makes prosthetic devices, said via Twitter that he and other workers were evacuated after being locked inside for about 20 minutes while electric generators were started.   San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a frequent critic of recovery efforts since the September hurricane, worried that Puerto Rico won't be prepared for the upcoming hurricane season. ""Today's total power outage in Puerto Rico pinpoints the fact that we are still in a very fragile state. Moreover, the suffering of the Puerto Rican people seems to be nowhere nearing an end,"" she said.   Play ball! But the mayor said backup systems and mobile tower lights allowed Wednesday night's baseball game between the Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins to go on as planned at Hiram Bithorn Stadium. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she tweeted.  Puerto Rico, home to more than 3 million US citizens, has grappled with widespread power outages for months since Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean island. Puerto Rico's power outage is now the second-largest blackout in history Puerto Rico has lost 3.4 billion customer-hours of electricity service due to Maria, according to an analysis released last week by the economic data analytics and policy firm Rhodium Group.  It's the largest blackout in US history (in terms of customer hours) and the second largest in the world -- after the outage caused when Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people. Puerto Rico's power authority faced widespread criticism late last year for signing a $300 million contract to restore power with Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana-based firm with only two employees at the time. The utility canceled the contract amid public outcry, and its executive director stepped down in November.  CNN's Natalie Gallón and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

104,Puerto Rico's power outage is now the second-largest blackout on record,Doug Criss,4/16/18," You may have thought the world had run out of superlatives to describe the misery that Hurricane Maria brought to Puerto Rico. Well now, here's another one: second-largest blackout in history. Since the monster storm slammed into the American Caribbean territory in September 2017 and heavily damaged the power grid, more than 3.4 billion hours of electricity have been lost there. That makes it the second-longest blackout in world history,  according to a report from the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm . The only blackout in world history bigger than Puerto Rico's is the one that came after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines in 2013. About 6.1 billion hours of power were lost after that massive storm. The Rhodium Group analysis largely relies on data on electricity loss provided to the Department of Energy, as well as news reports for storms prior to 2000, according to Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium who co-wrote the analysis with Peter Marsters. The analysis leaves out war-related destruction of electrical infrastructure. The worst in US history Houser said the group analyzes the economic impacts of weather and climate events, and they decided to dig in more deeply on the impacts of Maria on the Puerto Rican economy. ""As we started looking at the scale of the blackout and try to put that in historical context, it became clear this was a record-breaking event and worthy of some attention and focus just from an electric standpoint,"" Houser said. The blackout is already the worst in US history , beating out Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Right now, Rhodium estimates power has been restored to 96% of the island, meaning that 53,000 households -- between 100,000 and 200,000 people -- still don't have electricity, some seven months after the storm. Houser and Marsters said their research shows that ""making existing electricity supply more resilient to storm-related disruptions in both developed and developing countries is also important, particularly given recent and projected changes in the global climate.""",https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/16/us/puerto-rico-blackout-second-largest-globally-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjikvij2sj6AhVAmIQIHfS9BHI4RhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3zq7guv_ooUSnaoiqSD7yH,CNN,Liberal
105,Power returning to Puerto Rico after massive outage caused by fallen tree,"Ray Sanchez, Leyla Santiago and Khushbu Shah",4/12/18," Power was gradually returning to Puerto Rico Thursday night after the US commonwealth was hit with a massive outage -- nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria destroyed much of the island's infrastructure and its electrical grid.   The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, said a tree fell on a major power line, knocking out service to 870,000 customers, about half its clients. The utility tweeted an image it said was of the tree that fell across a power line near the southeast mountain town of Cayey.  In a statement Thursday evening, PREPA executive Justo Gonzalez Torres said a major transmission line was damaged while contractors were clearing vegetation.   A worker suffered burns on a hand and foot when the machine he was operating touched the tree that came down on the power line, said Jesus Martinez, director of Emergency Management for Cayey. The worker was in stable condition.  Power had been restored to about 779,000 customers by early evening, and full restoration was expected in the next few hours, PREPA said. Major blackouts were reported earlier from the northern coastal town of Manatí to Yabucoa, roughly 50 miles southeast.  The blackout also included the capital of San Juan, the most populated area of the island. ""We are devastated at this point,"" Cynthia García Coll, an educational psychologist who lives near San Juan, told CNN. ""Every time this happens we go into PTSD mode.""  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said earlier that it could take eight to 16 hours for electricity to return.  Cruz posted images on Twitter of police officers directing traffic on the streets of San Juan. The mayor, shortly before 5 p.m., reported that power was returning to parts of the capital.  Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, home to more than 3 million US citizens, in late September.  Puerto Rico has lost 3.4 billion customer-hours of electricity service due to Maria, according to  an analysis released Thursday by the economic data analytics and policy firm Rhodium Group . That made it the largest blackout in US history and the second largest in the world -- after the outage caused when  Typhoon Haiyan tore the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people. ""More customer-hours have been lost in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria than in the rest of the US over the past five years due to all causes combined,"" according to the group's analysis.  ""We are becoming a Third World country,"" García Coll said. ""And we the people in the street ... are working 24/7 to contribute to this country's recovery without reliable infrastructure.""   The power authority reported last month that  more than 100,000 people were still in the dark. The  US Army Corps of Engineers said more than $200 million worth of materials  were to arrive in Puerto Rico in March to help the corps' power restoration efforts. The materials included more than 7,000 poles and nearly 400 miles of conductor wire, according to Col. Jason Kirk, commander of the Corps' district that includes the island. The Corps of Engineers has said back-to-back 2017 disasters, the remoteness of the island and the fact that some supplies had to be manufactured for installation in Puerto Rico, slowed down work on the electric system.  The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority faced widespread criticism late last year for signing a $300 million contract to restore power with  Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana-based firm  with only two employees at the time of the contract.  The public utility company canceled the contract amid public outcry and its  executive director stepped down in November.  San Juan resident Domingo Marqués said on Thursday that many residents have lost confidence in both PREPA and the island's government.  ""At this point, we are so helpless and hopeless,"" Marqués said. ""We still have so many people exposed to suffering, displacement and trauma that two hours without power is like a reminder that the problem is nowhere near to be fixed. We have just learned to live with it.""

48,Puerto Rico To Shutter 283 More Schools This Summer As Education Crisis Deepens,Dominique Mosbergen,4/6/18,"In another bleak development for Puerto Rico’s decimated education system, the island’s Department of Education announced Thursday that it would close an additional 283 schools this summer, a 25 percent reduction in the current number of public schools.Puerto Rico Education Secretary Julia Keleher said a sharp decline in student enrollment and the territory’s ongoing economic crisis, especially since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, had prompted the closures. Almost half of all schools are at less than 60 percent of enrollment capacity, Keleher said, with nearly 39,000 fewer students than a year ago. Officials have said several thousand more students are expected to leave the island for the mainland to continue their education in the coming years.“We know it’s a difficult and painful process,” Keleher said of the impending closures, according to The Associated Press. “Our children deserve the best education that we are capable of giving them, taking into account Puerto Rico’s fiscal reality.” The closures are expected save the education department about $150 million, said Keleher. She stressed, however, that no teachers would be laid off but some would be transferred between schools.Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory in September, dealt a major blow to Puerto Rico’s education system, which had already been suffering from an enrollment slump. Last summer, 179 public schools on the island were shuttered and 150 more were closed from 2010 to 2015.Following the new spate of closures, just 828 public schools will remain open, AP reported.Teachers and parents have reacted with fury and frustration to the new closures.“This is like killing 300 communities,” Aida Díaz, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Teachers, told Education Week. “We’re going to have communities that are not going to have any schools. The only place they have to meet is the school.”The association said the school closures would affect 60,000 students and 6,000 teachers, reported Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo Dia newspaper. Díaz estimated that 4,000 non-tenured teachers would leave their jobs regardless of the Education Department’s no-layoffs promise.“I don’t even know where the schools they’re being located to are,” Haydee Del Valle, whose 12-year-old son will need to transfer, told NBC News on Friday. “I don’t know if they’re too far away from us or if the school bus they take now will be able to take them there.”“This makes me sad because this is a great school,” she added.Díaz criticized the Education Department for not being transparent about how it decided which schools to close, noting that 45 of the schools had been recognized as schools of “excellence.”Thursday’s closure announcement comes on the heels of a controversial education reform bill signed in March by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. The bill aims to introduce a charter school pilot program and private school vouchers for 3 percent of students.Thousands of teachers went on strike on March 19 to protest the bill.“They think that because our island is vulnerable, because it doesn’t have electricity, that we’re going to let them privatize our schools, get rid of our teachers,” Mercedes Martínez, president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation, told NPR in March of the reform effort.

106,Puerto Rico tourism slowly bouncing back,Joe Yogerst,4/3/18," —  Last summer, Puerto Rican tourism officials were getting flooded with calls about ""Despacito"" (""Slowly""), the sexy megahit by Puerto Rican crooners Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee that made history as the most streamed song of all time. But nowadays they're much more likely to get calls from people in the travel industry or ordinary travelers wanting to know if tourism has recovered from the hurricanes that devastated the Caribbean island in September.Like the song, the answer is slowly — widespread but gradual recovery from one of the most destructive and deadly storms in Puerto Rico history.After Hurricane Irma on September 6 and Hurricane Maria on September 20 -- the latter passing directly over the island -- close to 100% of Puerto Rico was without power or water, the airport was closed and cruise terminals were devoid of ships.But six months later, tourism is well on the road to recovery in many areas.""The island has been officially open for tourism since ... December,"" said Carla Campos, acting executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, or PRTC. ""San Juan Port started welcoming leisure cruises just two weeks after Hurricane María and areas around the island like Culebra, Ponce, Mayagüez, Cabo Rojo, Rincón, Vieques are also back in business. The best way to support Puerto Rico is to continue visiting, staying at our hotels, eating at our restaurants, enjoying our activities and shopping.""Back in businessMore than 125 hotels (with more than 12,000 total rooms) were back in business by the end of February, while more than 4,000 restaurants around the island were serving customers again. That's about 80% of Puerto Rico's hotels and restaurants.The number of passenger ships calling on San Juan has risen steadily, from just 15 in October to 53 in December. PRTC says that more than 170,000 cruise passengers moved through the port of San Juan since the hurricanes. Other than the fact that many of the traffic lights are still out, the tourist zones of San Juan have almost completely recovered; the beach hotels are open in Condado and Isla Verde. Restaurants and bars are packed, and attractions like El Morro fort and Old San Juan are just as crowded as before the storms. The only tropical rainforest in the entire US Forest Service, El Yunque in the mountains of eastern Puerto Rico, looked like a World War I battlefield directly after the storms: the trees nearly leafless, the jungle slopes covered in mud. Aided by hundreds of volunteers, the forest service was able to get parts of the park open again by February, including the main road through to La Coca Falls and one of the most popular trails.    But that's not to say that everyone has recovered. Some of the resorts, restaurants and attractions directly in the eye of Hurricane Maria are still closed or struggling to open their doors again. For many, recovery has been difficult and often dramatic. It took some hotels -- like the posh  Royal Isabela  golf resort, which took a direct hit from Hurricane Maria -- months to repair the damage and open its doors again.A struggle to recoverFor many of the others, recovery was difficult and often dramatic.After the hurricanes,  Wyndham Grand Rio Mar  golf and beach resort east of San Juan was virtually cut off from the outside world. A combination of employees who rode out Hurricane Maria inside the hotel and others living nearby used chainsaws and axes to cut a path to the property.  Damage was extensive to the Wyndham's guest rooms, restaurants and golf courses. But general manager Nils Stolzlechner and his team devised a phased recovery plan that saw the golf courses in play by the end of November, the first post-storm convention in February, and reopening to the general public on March 1.Snagging that convention took major effort. The client was on the verge of canceling when Stolzlechner ""suggested that they come and visit to see firsthand that we are alive and well. And we convinced them to give us a chance.""Celebrity chef Mario Pagán faced a mixed blessing after the storm. His signature  Mario Pagan restaurant  in Condado was nearly unharmed. But down the road, his  Sage Steak Loft  in the Olive Boutique Hotel was flooded with 3 feet of brackish water from the storm surge. ""There were plenty of brutal challenges, but we worked through them,"" said Pagán. ""Getting gas and diesel for the generator was probably the main one. Produce and proteins were hard to get, but we managed with local purveyors. We had a lot of local farmers passing by the restaurant helping out with anything they had left.""Loisse Herger, co-owner of the chic Olive Boutique Hotel, faced similar flooding. But within days of the hurricane, Herger and her staff had the upstairs guest rooms ready for occupancy.""Right after the storm, most of our guests were journalists, humanitarian personnel, high government officials and others involved in the recovery,"" she said. By late January, Olive Boutique was full of bona-fide tourists and hosting a rooftop cocktail party for the Caribbean Travel Marketplace, another convention that decided to keep its commitment rather than abandon the island post-storm.  Another good sign is the return of surfers to an island generally considered to have the best waves in the Caribbean.""West facing beaches on the northwest coast took the hardest hit,"" said Otto Flores, a legendary Puerto Rican surfer and founder of a coastal environmental organization called Granito de Arena. ""The storm unleashed its fury -- decimating the coastline, taking down structures and putting them in the ocean like Baby Godzilla was playing Lego.""But after several recent visits to the northwest coast, Flores thinks the region's remarkable beaches are bouncing back. ""Yes, there are places with no power still and there are structures that are gone,"" he said. ""But as far as surfing goes, it's all good.""","https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/puerto-rico-tourism-post-hurricane/index.html

He captured once-flooded areas now beginning to be repaired, and shows major highways ripped apart by the storm now reopen to traffic.The images are promising, but Puerto Rico still has a long way to go. Portions of the island are still without power, cellphone service and electricity, living in houses with torn-off roofs and gasoline-powered generators, even though official government figures showmost services have been restored. Many Puerto Ricans have left the island ― and some may never return. And the tourist industry is still in big trouble. “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda has encouraged people to help the island recover by visiting and spending money there.See the transformation of Puerto Rico in the GIFs below.

107,Power and plantains are back -- for some -- six months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico,Leyla Santiago,3/20/18," I hear coquis, the tiny frogs that sing like birds at night, as the sun drops behind the mountains.  I smell the garlicky green paste we call sofrito that serves as the base for many of Puerto Rico's typical dishes.  And my uncles are poking fun at each other.  I am home. I'm in Corozal, Puerto Rico. I spent my summers here. I was married here. My family has lived here since the 1800s. This is all familiar to me.  But it's a normal life that was missing for so long after Hurricane Maria hit six months ago today. And really, it's still not even close to the old life on this island.  ""Leyla, I have plantains now. Want me to make you some arañitas?"" my Aunt Hilda asks me, offering a dish of shredded and fried plantains.  I would never pass up an offer for Aunt Hilda's food. She makes the best arañitas, although I would never admit it to my other aunts. But this isn't a big deal because Hilda is cooking. It's because we actually have plantains. The large banana is a staple in our diet. We mash it. We fry it. We sauté it. We eat it with just about every typical meal. And while Puerto Rico imported most of its food even before the storm hit on September 20, plantains were a local staple grown on the island.  The hurricane wiped out most of the plantain farms on the island. Supplies are being shipped in until there can be a harvest again, hurting our pride as well as our stomachs. Corozal is known for its plantains. In fact, our volleyball team's mascots are los plataneros, the plantain farmers.   As Hilda gets ready to shred the plantain, she calls for me to get video on my phone. With her typical sweet smile, she points out she can use her food processor to cook again. They now have power.  The electricity returned ""about a month ago,"" my Tio Jesus, a retired US Postal Service worker, tells me. Jesus, whose eyes close every time he smiles, jokes he is the famous one these days, the one CNN anchor Jake Tapper talked about on TV when his show replayed video of the two of us hugging the first time I reunited with my family, nine days after Hurricane Maria.  ""There is no word to express that feeling,"" he tells me in his best English as I film our conversation. ""I said, 'Oh God, you sent something that really really we love -- my niece.'"" ""Did you know why I was so upset, why I was crying?"" I ask.  I explain I had flown over the island, seen the destruction in a way many hadn't. I had seen the people of Puerto Rico suffering, without being able to reach my own family. I couldn't control my tears because I was overwhelmed and relieved to hear them say they were OK.    I didn't realize it, but nine days after Maria, much of my family in Corozal still had not grasped how bad the situation was on the island. They had no power. No TV. No cell service. Limited access on roads. No way of knowing how devastated Maria had left the island. How a month of hurricane nightmares changed Puerto Rico, and me Today, they are counting their blessings. My family is in the minority in Corozal. The mayor's office tells me 45% of the municipality has power.    With an arañita in hand, my uncle Eddie tells me he made sure the power workers from the US mainland had water and coffee.  ""I want to make sure they leave this island and tell everyone how well they were treated by our people. That way, if someone ever speaks badly about Puerto Rico, they can say, 'no, that's not true, they're good people,'"" he said in Spanish.  Down the street, I find a team of four from Tampa Electric working to restore power. TECO has 25 employees here under a mutual aid agreement. They managed to turn the lights on for this section of Corozal, but had to pinpoint why one house in particular still couldn't get the lights on. They believe it was an issue with the home's breaker.  The supervisor, Ron Wright, who likes to say, ""never been wrong"" after giving his last name, calls this latest mission the best experience of his 39-year career.  Wright has been working on Puerto Rico's power grid since January. He is quick to say the people are resilient, but hesitates when I ask when power will be fully restored on the island. ""The biggest challenge is materials, getting materials in, and the work areas, getting some of the roads cleared, the debris cleared, so that we're able to get trucks in here,"" Wright says.  $200 million in supplies heading to Puerto Rico There are now 1,260 contractors working on Puerto Rico's power grid, under the US Army Corps of Engineers. Most are already making exit plans. The Tampa Electric crew in Corozal tells me they will leave on Thursday.  While things are improving for many families in Corozal -- now with power and plantains -- not everyone can say the same.  According to Puerto Rico's Power Authority, 103,000 people still don't have electricity. Lourdes Santiago (no relation), 56, is one of them. She lives about 25 minutes from my family, and her 37-year-old son is bedridden because of complications from diabetes. Six months after the storm, people are still dying During Maria, Lourdes took him to the hospital. They stayed there for two months. She returned to a home without a roof. A local church donated a tarp that is meant for 30-day use. It's still on her roof. These days, when it rains, water finds its way into the home, forcing her to have buckets inside. ""At first it was an uphill battle, but things are improving,"" she says. She shows me a generator the non-profit organization Samaritan's Purse gave her. It is efficient for gas, she tells me.  And finally, finally, she got running water in her home just last Friday.  The mayor's office tells me FEMA is still sending aid. They still receive food and water, but the amount varies from week to week. Impact Your World: How to help Puerto Rico ""Today, there are a lot of people here that don't have nothing, and they are forgotten. They don't have no place to go. They don't have no job,"" my uncle Jesus says. ""We are a little better. But (the recovery will be) long term.""

108,$200 million in supplies heading to Puerto Rico to fix the power grid,Leyla Santiago and Khushbu Shah,3/2/18," More than $200 million dollars' worth of materials are expected to arrive in Puerto Rico this month to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hit its 95% power restoration goal at the end of the month. More than 7,000 poles and nearly 400 miles of conductor wire are slated to arrive in the next two weeks, said Col. Jason Kirk, commander of the Corps' district that includes the island. The additional supplies, according to Kirk, are part of the reason he believes the people of Puerto Rico can count on 90 to 95% power restoration by March 31.  Contractors restoring power in Puerto Rico under the USACE are expected to leave the island by mid-April, according to the Corps' current plan as obtained by CNN.  According to Puerto Rico's power authority, on average 87% of the island has power. But Kirk admits that number falls to about 50% in the interior part of the island, and 150,000 US citizens on the island  still don't have power .  ""We know that there are a couple of regions that will take into April, potentially May,"" Kirk told CNN. USACE is downsizing, as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is increasing its workforce across the island. The Army Corps of Engineers projects its contractors will have completed work by April 7. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló has repeatedly expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery and  help. He has questioned the USACE's response on the island compared to other states dealing with disasters. At a press conference Wednesday, he claimed  people on the US territory are being treated like second class citizens, saying, ""I don't see the urgency.""  Getting the work done has also become a frustration for mayors on the island like Jorge Gonzalez Otero of Jayuya, in the interior part of the island. He tells people in his municipality, ""Prepare yourselves. We're in it for the long haul.""  Only 45% of Jayuya, according to the mayor's office, has power. Hurricane Maria wiped out the power grid when it hit Puerto Rico on September 20 last year. And even where the electricity has been restored, like in the capital San Juan, mass outages are still happening. A journey along the path of Hurricane Maria USACE admits materials have been a challenge in restoration efforts. ""The initial assessment told us that we would need about 60,000 power poles and over 3 million individual items to work the repair of 30,000 miles of line across the island,"" Kirk said. To date, USACE has received 38,831 poles and 3,068 miles of conductor wire for power restoration efforts. Some of the materials expected to arrive this month were manufactured in January in South Carolina. According to Kirk, a big part of the challenge is the amount of material needed, the distance it has to travel, and the response to other disasters.  Puerto Rico's governor claims USACE agreed to have power restored in 45 days, but did not provide proof.  Kirk, however, counters, ""The Army Corps has never committed to a 45-day restoration time line.""  At its peak, USACE had more than 4,000 contractors and personnel at work on the island. Currently, about 2,300 workers are engaged in the power restoration efforts, as many people across the island wait for the lights to come back on.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/us/puerto-rico-power-supplies/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiiy7as5Mj6AhUUmYQIHZABB0Y4tAEQFnoECAkQAg&usg=AOvVaw1vCpAqU3XGJezmLs2nMjr8,CNN,Liberal
110,Puerto Rico 'exodus': How CNN analyzed and mapped the data,Sergio Hernandez,2/21/18," For its story and graphics showing where Puerto Ricans  may have migrated after Hurricane Maria, CNN analyzed two national data sets obtained under the Freedom of Information Act: Application data from the  Federal Emergency Management System's Individuals and Households Program , which provides housing and financial assistance to eligible disaster victims, and Change-of-address orders placed with the US Postal Service. Individual assistance applications The FEMA data, which captured 1,057,006 applications through November 11, included ZIP codes for each applicant's current mailing address and ""damaged dwelling."" An early analysis of the data found thousands of entries where ZIP codes were either invalid or indicated a damaged property location outside Puerto Rico. FEMA officials told CNN these errors occurred because ZIP codes are ""a required field that is entered by the registrant"" when they apply for assistance and ""it is possible that registrants do not know their ZIP code, and therefore enter any value as the field is required to be entered before they can continue."" While the agency said it has a process in place to correct or validate addresses, ""This only occurs if the address is recognized, so it does not catch all cases where an address may have an incorrect entry."" To limit the number of incorrect entries in its analysis, CNN compared each application's damaged dwelling ZIP code against a list of valid Puerto Rican ZIP codes provided by the US Postal Service. CNN also excluded cases where an applicant listed their ""Current Location"" as ""Damaged Dwelling,"" which suggested an applicant had either not moved at all or provided a mailing ZIP code that was different from where they were residing. When other data points suggested error, such as one case where the applicant's damaged dwelling was listed as a ""Correctional Facility"" but listed the current location as ""Family/Friends,"" those records were also excluded. CNN then calculated the total number of applications by mailing address ZIP code and -- because ZIP codes represent postal delivery routes, not geographic areas -- used geospatial data from the US Census Bureau to match applications to their corresponding  ZIP Code Tabulation Area, or ZCTA , a census unit that approximates the geographic areas served by ZIP code routes. Because ZCTAs and metro areas do not always conform to county -- or even state -- lines, CNN then grouped applications by county and  Core-Based Statistical Area  based on which counties and CBSAs contained each ZCTA's centroid. CNN calculated state totals by grouping the county-level figures. Change-of-address orders CNN obtained data from the US Postal Service listing the number of change-of-address orders originating from Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands between October 1 and December 31. For privacy reasons, the Postal Service would not release change-of-address totals for individual ZIP codes, only at the three-digit prefix level and where the totals were greater than 25. Because the Postal Service data distinguished between three-digit ZIPs where the change-of-address volume was 0 and where the total had been withheld (meaning it was somewhere between 1 and 25), we filled in the minimum possible value: 1. CNN then analyzed the Census Bureau's geospatial data for ZCTAs, combining shapes that shared a three-digit prefix and joining them with the change-of-address totals to map the address change orders.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/us/puerto-rico-migration-data-methodology-invs/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi0qOrB3Mj6AhU6ZjABHRp2ATA4ZBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw2a3tJGLvlnVpwARd75fEAE,CNN,Liberal
109,'Exodus' from Puerto Rico: A visual guide,John D. Sutter and Sergio Hernandez,2/21/18," Before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, there already was an unprecedented migration from the Caribbean island to the mainland United States -- at least in part because of the US commonwealth's financial crisis. After the storm, academics are starting to use words such as ""exodus"" and ""stampede"" to describe the massive outflow of people.  ""This is the greatest migration ever from Puerto Rico since records have been taken,"" said Jorge Duany, a professor of anthropology at Florida International University.  Some reasons for the migration are obvious: Millions of Americans living in Puerto Rico were left without power or running water because of the Category 4 hurricane. Schools were closed. Jobs lost. There seemed to be little hope on the horizon. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can move to the states without visas or other paperwork. And so, many did.  Yet the scope and shape of this diaspora remain mysterious.  So far, estimates of its size have been based on airline traveler data, which some academics consider unreliable because flying off the island doesn't necessarily mean you're going to migrate. Florida school enrollment numbers have added clarity, but they only cover students who showed up in the Sunshine State, not the entire nation.  To get a clearer picture of the migration patterns,  CNN analyzed data from two federal government agencies  obtained under the US Freedom of Information Act.  Together, the data sets from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the US Postal Service show Puerto Ricans appear to have migrated to all 50 US states in the aftermath of Maria.  As of November 11, FEMA received at least 10,600 applications for disaster assistance from ZIP codes in 50  states and Washington, according to FEMA data provided to CNN. The applications may represent households, not individual people. The average Puerto Rican household is made up of about three people, according to the US Census Bureau. In total, FEMA received more than 1 million applications for aid related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico -- indicating nearly everyone who asked FEMA for help under its Individual Assistance programs did not leave the island after the storm.  Still, the data appear to show a substantial increase in the outflow of people from Puerto Rico.  ""It sounds possible that we're on pace for a historic net outmigration to the US"" from Puerto Rico, said Jens Manuel Krogstad, an editor at the Pew Research Center. ""In 2015, the net outmigration was about 64,000 people. And so, from the numbers you described, it sounds like it's possible that even after just a few months we're already on pace to overshoot that."" Separately, between October 1 and December 31, the US Postal Service received at least 6,590 change-of-address requests -- nearly five times the amount received during the same months the previous year -- from Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands to the 50 states and District of Columbia. The Postal Service received about 2,900 additional requests to change addresses within Puerto Rico, according to the data, suggesting that while some people left Puerto Rico, others moved within the storm-battered island. Neither data source is a precise measurement of hurricane-related migration. It's possible that some people changed their addresses for reasons unrelated to Hurricane Maria. FEMA applicants could have listed current addresses in the states for reasons other than migration. They may have listed a relative's address in the states even if they did not move away from Puerto Rico, a FEMA representative said. Several demographers and disaster experts said these methods of counting -- tracking disaster-assistance claims and official changes of address -- may substantially undercount the true number of people who fled Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.  That's because not everyone who leaves Puerto Rico also files a disaster claim with FEMA, and of those who did file and also moved, some may have listed the address of a relative or friend rather than their new location, said Alexis Santos, a Penn State University demographer who grew up in Puerto Rico. Others may move away from the island without knowing exactly where they will land, he said, making it difficult to track relocations based on this paperwork.  Further, people in Puerto Rico are disinclined to use change-of-address forms -- even in normal circumstances, Santos said. He finds it especially unlikely that everyone who moved in the frantic aftermath of Hurricane Maria took the time to file those requests.  ""That process -- we normally don't do it,"" he said. ""We use our mom's address or something. Still, my uncles receive letters at my grandmother's house."" ""I don't know how representative that is of everyone who's left,"" William H. Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studied the Hurricane Katrina diaspora, said of the findings. More interesting, he said, is what the data say about where people are going. Among the surprises: Migrants appear to have moved to every US state.  FEMA applicants listed current ZIP codes in 48 states -- including 11 households in Hawaii, seven in Alaska, three in each of the Dakotas and two in Wyoming.  US Postal Service data suggest people moved after the storm to at least 49 states -- all but Alaska -- plus Washington, D.C., the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.  ""There are people going to South Dakota to work on farms and turkey factories,"" said Edwin Meléndez, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College in New York and director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies. Migrants primarily follow the patterns family members and friends have set before them, he said, but they also seek out steady jobs wherever they might be available. ""People are looking for any kind of job they can get,"" said the Pew Research Center's Krogstad. ""And if (the job is) in Alaska, they're willing to give it a shot. ""That happens a lot with migration,"" he continued. ""It's what happened a lot over the past 25 years with migration to the Midwest (United States) from Latin America -- people moving to small towns that previously had not seen much demographic diversity.""  Florida appears to be the top destination for Maria migrants -- by far.  More than half -- 52% -- of households that filed claims with FEMA from the states did so from Florida, which is the closest state to Puerto Rico geographically and has been the top destination for Puerto Ricans in recent years.  Outside Puerto Rico, the top six counties for FEMA claims -- Orange, Osceola, Miami-Dade, Broward, Hillsborough and Polk counties -- all are in Florida, according to the FEMA data. Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford -- a metro area in central Florida already known as a mecca for Puerto Ricans -- is the top metro area for applicants outside Puerto Rico. Other top states for migrants were New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas and Connecticut, all of which already had sizable Puerto Rican populations.  US Postal Service data tell a similar story, with about 40% of address change requests from Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands listing new ZIP codes in Florida. Other top locations for these requests, which include mail-forwarding requests as well as actual change-of-address orders, included Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas and Massachusetts, followed by the US Virgin Islands.  It is logical that hurricane victims would move to locations where large numbers of Puerto Ricans already are established, demographers and academics said.  ""I would imagine that a lot of people were already thinking about leaving Puerto Rico and this was the final blow,"" said Carlos A. Suárez Carrasquillo, a lecturer in political science at the University of Florida. ""I am sure that in some cases people were desperate and either left with the humanitarian flights that happened initially or were able to amass money to leave."" What does all of this mean for US politics?  Puerto Ricans tend to vote left of center, and many have expressed outrage at the way the Republican White House has handled the federal response to the disaster. And while, yes, Puerto Ricans are American citizens even in the Caribbean, they can't vote for president or elect voting members of the US Congress unless they establish residency in the states.  Florida has become a particular focus of attention since it has welcomed so many migrants.  Gov. Rick Scott in October declared a state of emergency because so many people were arriving . Florida schools have seen more than 11,500 new students from Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria hit, according to data provided by the Florida Department of Education on February 6.  Still, there remains too little information to argue that Maria migrants will sway elections, said Daniel Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Florida.

""I have to wait and see,"" Smith said. ""Certainly, one could look at analogous situations (like) the displacement of folks following Katrina in New Orleans. I don't think the lesson we learned from that is that those who were displaced -- or who stayed home -- became more politically active. I haven't ever seen any evidence of that. ... If not, why are we assuming some supra political participation among the migrants of Puerto Rico to the mainland? There is certainly, in many people's eyes, good reason for them to become politically engaged and mobilized and to have a clear vote choice. But I'm a realist and I know there are many barriers to participation."" Among them: These are disaster victims we're talking about, said Suárez, the University of Florida political scientist who also is Puerto Rican. ""If they were traumatized by the experience of the hurricane, the last thing they (may) want to do is think about politics.""  The other question is how long people will stay put.  Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, followed migrants for years after Hurricane Katrina hit the US Gulf Coast in 2005. People moved several, if not a dozen, times, she said. Some returned home.  ""It was unbelievable, and at times almost unbearable to the heart and mind, to track that amount of displacement in such a short period of time"" after Katrina, she said. ""One moment -- one point on a map at a singular time -- doesn't actually at all tell the story of what displacement means, especially for the most low-income and disadvantaged people. They're oftentimes living very mobile and very uncertain lives, and when you throw a disaster in, everything is in play. And everything is in transition for such a long period of time."" Some academics said they find the focus on US politics to be somewhat myopic given the context of what's happening to more than 3 million people still living in Puerto Rico. ""What will happen to them?"" said Pew's Krogstad. ""Even before the storm, Puerto Ricans on the island significantly lagged Puerto Ricans on the mainland on a variety of economic measures -- like child poverty and median household income.  ""The concern is that these gaps are going to grow even wider."" ""To be frank,"" said Suárez, ""not only is it self-serving, but it also fails to reflect the desperate conditions and the grating inequality under which the people on the island of Puerto Rico live. That aspect gets lost. This is a place where people are the most desperate."" Demographic shifts may only make the situation worse.  The island population has been declining since 2004, at least partly because of Puerto Rico's debt crisis and, more recently, government bankruptcy. All signs pointed to continued population decline, even before Hurricane Maria, according to demographers. The consequences for Puerto Rico could be stark. The population is aging. Maria may help sap the island of vital workers. That could further stall the economy, leading to decreased tax revenue and government services.  ""You're losing people and you're in an economic depression,"" said Meléndez of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies. ""The people are what keep businesses open -- restaurants and policemen and all of that. So to the extent that the population is declining, you have a problem with economic recovery."" No US states are shrinking in the way that Puerto Rico is, Krogstad said. ""If you compare Puerto Rico to other US states, there really isn't any comparison."" ""Puerto Rico has seen a net decline of 500,000 people to the US mainland over the past decade or so,"" he added. ""These are huge shifts. We haven't seen migration (out of Puerto Rico) of this scale since the World War II era."" Before the hurricane, this alarmed demographers.  Now, doomsday scenarios aren't all so difficult to imagine. Lyman Stone, an economist working with the Puerto Rican Financial Oversight and Management Board to develop population projections, said his early analysis of  airline data from the US Department of Transportation  shows 179,000 net airline travelers left Puerto Rican airports for the states between September and November.  Stone  estimates the island's population will continue to shrink . If the island rebounds relatively quickly from Hurricane Maria -- which he terms a ""weak Maria"" effect -- then perhaps the population will stay closer to 3 million in the next decade. If problems on the island snowball, pushing more people out -- which he terms a ""strong Maria"" effect -- Stone estimates Puerto Rico's population could plunge below 2 million by 2040.  These are rough estimates, he said, but the trend is clear. ""In 10 years, Puerto Rico will have less than 3 million people and still be headed quickly towards 2.5 million or lower,"" he said. ""Once below that level, I don't think it will come back above 2.5 million -- effectively ever."" Beyond that, Stone said, only questions remain: Will another hurricane hit? Will Congress provide enough money to help rebuild? Will people return to Puerto Rico -- or will more flee?  Time will tell. CNN's Curt Merrill contributed to this report.

111,Color brings hope to Puerto Rico,Christopher Dawson,2/20/18," With paintbrushes in hand, residents of the Ciales municipality are trying to dab color -- and hope -- back into their community blown drab by Hurricane Maria.   They paint in the daylight. There isn't electricity to run lights at night. Basic necessities like food and water are still not getting through. Leaves have still not grown back. But the people of this town in Puerto Rico's mountains show growing resolve as their vibrant mural takes shape across the walls and floor of an old gymnasium.  How to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria  ""The mural was a symbol for hope for the community,"" explains Casey Harrity, Save the Children's team leader in Puerto Rico. ""It is a chance for everyone to take part in the rebuilding, to be agents of change themselves."" The children especially took to the project and the idea that they could make things better. Their brush strokes and tiny handprints reflect their commitment to the work and the message.    ""So many kids have had this energy awoken in them that has been dormant,"" says Jenith, a local resident. ""a lot of desire to keep moving forward."" Events like this aim to strengthen the hearts of Puerto Ricans, whose resiliency is being tested by the slow recovery.   Hundreds of thousands still do not have power , and those with electricity face blackouts. Rain still soaks the thousands who  wait for government-issued tarps  to temporarily replace the roofs blown away five months ago. But blue and green tarps dotting the landscape are not inspiring colors of hope. Instead, buckets of paint, brought by charities like  Save the Children  and Apartial, are helping communities create murals that spread encouragement.  In Punta Santiago, for example, on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico, a new mural shows the vibrant foliage that has yet to return to the countryside. The Spanish phrase written on the skyline translates to ""there is no leaf that dies without another that is born.""",https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/iyw-puerto-rico-color-returns/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjusta46sj6AhVspIQIHYthDb848AEQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw2RRHpWVwNPCNJGoHeAT-6j,CNN,Liberal
112,Hospitals are turning to hurricane-hit Puerto Rico to recruit nurses,Parija Kavilanz,2/16/18,"Hurricane Maria was the final straw for Gina Aponte Torres.  Aponte Torres had been working as an emergency room nurse at Puerto Rico Medical Center in San Juan for roughly two years. She loved being a nurse, but the island's struggling economy meant she was making much less than she would in the U.S. So in September, she applied to Florida Hospital's international nurse recruitment program.    
 
  Maria struck a week later ,  knocking out power and downing trees that temporarily trapped her in her house with her parents. When Aponte Torres could finally access a cell phone signal, she saw the email from Florida Hospital. She had been accepted.   ""[I]t pushed me to make my final decision to leave,"" said Aponte Torres, who moved to Kissimmee, Florida, in late December.      Gina Aponte Torres was accepted by Florida Hospital a month after Hurricane Maria hit.    Since she started working as a full-time emergency room nurse for Florida Hospital, Aponte Torres says her pay has doubled, she's getting more on-the-job training and her workload has shrunk -- nurses in her unit are assigned to just four patients at a time instead of the 10 she used to be responsible for in Puerto Rico.    ""This is my dream come true,"" she says.   In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Florida Hospital, which operates 26 hospitals throughout the state, has recruited as many as 45 health care professionals from Puerto Rico -- including nurses, medical technologists and nutrition specialists.   Like many other medical facilities in the U.S., Florida Hospital needs the help.   ""The country has struggled with a nursing shortage since the early 2000s,"" says Seun Ross, director of nursing practice and work environment at the American Nurses Association.   Not only are experienced nurses retiring at a rapid clip, schools aren't graduating enough nurses to be able to replenish the workforce.   Exacerbating the problem is the aging U.S. population, which is fueling demand for health care services. Nearly 48 million people in the U.S., or about 15% of the population, are currently 65 years of age and older,  according to the Census Bureau .   ""We estimate the U.S. will need to produce over one million new registered nurses by 2022 to fill newly created jobs and replace a legion of soon-to-be retirees,"" says Ross.   That has Florida Hospital looking everywhere it can for new workers.    ""We're hiring them as quickly as we can find them. It's come one, come all,"" says Karla Muniz, the nonprofit health care system's senior director of talent acquisition.      Florida Hospital began an international recruitment program for nurses a decade ago. It has since hired nurses from the Philippines, India, Canada and the UK.   But Puerto Rico has become one of its most promising pipelines for talent. Before Hurricane Maria struck, about 3% of Florida Hospital's nurses came from Puerto Rico as a growing number of its residents migrated to the U.S. to escape the economic problems that were plaguing the island. But now, Muniz says that percentage is expected to double.   Florida Hospital has even developed an outreach program, partnering with community groups to find and help healthcare professionals from Puerto Rico find jobs. The hospital also fast tracks the hiring process. Interviews, applications, as well as getting the state requirements for nursing are all expedited, said Muniz.   ""Many [Puerto Rican candidates] or most are bilingual, so they already have a good handle on the language,"" she says. ""Many clinical processes that they are already familiar with easily translate here on the mainland.""   And given that Central Florida has a large Puerto Rican population, she says many nurses they hire already have local connections and are able to easily integrate themselves into the workplace and the community.      Cox Medical Center South, one of CoxHealth's hospitals in Springfield, Missouri.    CoxHealth, a nonprofit regional healthcare system operating six hospitals and 80 clinics in Missouri, initiated a nurse recruitment effort in Puerto Rico last spring.      While CoxHealth has also been hiring nurses from   other countries ,  Puerto Rico has emerged as an easier option ""because we don't have to deal with work visa issues,"" said Celeste Cramer, the group's director of recruitment and retention.   There were at least 10 other nurses from Puerto Rico in Sharlene Morales' orientation class after she arrived in Florida.   Morales, 34, was working as a progressive care nurse at Doctors' Center Hospital in San Juan when Maria hit. She was earning $14.15 an hour, working long shifts and attending to as many as 15 patients at a time because the hospital was understaffed. ""I barely saw my husband and my daughter,"" she says.      Morales had heard from other nurses about Florida Hospital's international recruiting program and contacted the hospital after the hurricane hit.      Sharlene Morales' hourly pay almost doubled after she left her nursing job in Puerto Rico and moved to the U.S.    She went to Florida for an interview in November and by early December, she began her eight-week orientation program at Florida Hospital's Winter Park Memorial Hospital.   Her pay has almost doubled to $25.71 an hour since. She's also handling fewer patients and has more time to spend with her family. She hopes to become an ICU nurse soon.    Mary Perrone, the international recruiter for Florida Hospital, said 20 more nurses from Puerto Rico will finish training and be on staff in the coming weeks.      CoxHealth sent a recruiting team to Puerto Rico this month to scout for nursing talent.    CoxHealth sent a recruiting team to Puerto Rico last weekend for on-site interviews with nursing candidates. If all goes well, it hopes to hire 30 more nurses soon, says Cramer.   ""The nursing shortage is across units but the highest demand for us is in the ICU, emergency room and medical and surgical units,"" said Cramer.   The hospital network hasn't set a cap on how many nurses it expects to hire from the island, she says.   ""There was already a lot of interest before Maria and it's overwhelming now,"" says Cramer.

113,Explosion cuts power in Puerto Rico,Leyla Santiago and Susannah Cullinane,2/12/18," An explosion and fire at a power substation caused a blackout in parts of northern  Puerto Rico  on Sunday, according to authorities. Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority (PREPA) said on Twitter that 400 megawatts of power generation had been lost. The fire was caused by a mechanical failure and impacted sections of San Juan, Trujillo Alto, Guaynabo, Carolina, Caguas, and Juncos, PREPA spokesman Carlos Monroig told CNN. Monroig said the majority of customers would have power restored Sunday night, but that communities powered by substations Villa Betina and Quebrada Negrito would likely be without power until Monday afternoon. No injuries were reported, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz tweeted on her verified account. ""It appears fire has almost totally been extinguished and the cooling phase is beginning,"" Yulin posted. She told CNN that light was already beginning to return to several areas, but that she didn't know the percentage of people with or without power in San Juan.  It is also unclear how many people are with or without power across the affected areas of Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico's 3.4 million citizens have endured months of hardship since Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20 with 155 mph winds. The Category 4 storm cut power to much of the island. In late January, PREPA issued a statement saying more than 450,000 customers remained without electricity. The authority said then that it was working with state and federal agencies, including the US Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, and power industry contractors, ""to execute an aggressive plan to advance the restoration.""  PREPA came under fire late last year after entering into a controversial $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based firm that employed two people when the storm hit.      CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/11/us/puerto-rico-power/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjusta46sj6AhVspIQIHYthDb848AEQFnoECAIQAg&usg=AOvVaw3KHyK1VXjgeg-fL-cum8L9,CNN,Liberal
114,"Contractor promised 30 million meals to Puerto Rico. Only 50,000 were delivered. Lawmakers ask why.",Leyla Santiago and Khushbu Shah,2/6/18," Two Democrats are calling for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be subpoenaed for documents relating to  Hurricane Maria , suggesting the agency failed to provide tens of millions of meals after the storm devastated  Puerto Rico . US Rep. Elijah Cummings and Stacey Plaskett, the congressional delegate from the US Virgin Islands,  signed a letter to  House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy  on Tuesday morning, calling into question a $156 million contract awarded to a small Atlanta-based company, Tribute Contracting LLC.  The company delivered 50,000 of the 30 million meals promised in a contract signed October 3, less than 0.25 percent, according to Tribute Contracting owner Tiffany Brown. Amanda Gonzalez, communications director for Gowdy, said the Republican chairman was unaware of the issue until the letter was sent.  ""The minority had numerous opportunities to bring this to the attention of both our staff and (the Department of Homeland Security)/FEMA during our discussions and briefings on the hurricane recovery efforts, but they failed to do so until a public letter demanding a subpoena,"" she said. Contract terminated 20 days after signing According to documents that Brown provided to CNN, FEMA terminated the agreement -- the largest direct meals contract during the 2017 hurricane season -- ""due to late delivery of the approved heater meals."" The contract was terminated October 23, 20 days after it was signed.  ""One of the primary reasons FEMA failed to deliver these meals is because it inexplicably awarded a contract worth approximately $156 million to deliver 30 million emergency meals to a tiny, one-person company with a history of struggling with much smaller contracts,"" Cummings and Plaskett said in the letter. Brown said Tuesday that she has been overwhelmed and plans to sue the government for $70 million. ""Here is what I can say, I've had challenges with government contracts in the past. The primary reason is financial resources, and lack of support,"" she said. Tribute Contracting LLC is registered as a one-employee company with an annual revenue of $1,000 on the government's Federal Procurement Data System. Brown, however, said the profile is out of date.  Brown admits she did not have sufficient funds to finance the project fully but insists her company was not awarded the contract through any ""hookups"" with FEMA. ""I got it because I had a very good  proposal  and understanding of what was needed,"" she told CNN.  FEMA paid Tribute Contracting $255,000 for the 50,000 meals the company delivered, according to Brown, but she said the payment was not prompt and limited her ability to make on-time deliveries and ramp up production through subcontractors. Brown is appealing the decision to terminate the contract. ""They need to really shore up their infrastructure for payment for their contractors,"" Brown said. ""If you want someone to provide a service of $155 million, you really should pay or wire transfer within 24 hours or pay a percentage."" Under a schedule of supplies in the contract agreement, FEMA indicates 30 million meals should be delivered by October 23. Brown claims there was a verbal agreement for the schedule to ""evolve.""   In an October 11 email to Brown, FEMA states, ""There (sic) are asking vendors to delay delivery on all meals for 48 hours. This only includes drivers not in (sic) route. The wait in Jacksonville is extensive."" Previous disagreements with government agencies  As the Democrats' letter points out, and CNN confirmed, Brown has had multiple disputes with government agencies in the past. The federal prison system canceled contracts with Tribute Contracting in 2013 and 2014.  Brown calls the canceled prison contracts ""intentional."" She said inflated product prices did not allow her to honor the prices she originally gave the prisons. Moving forward with the contract, she said would have put her in debt.   ""Sometimes you have to make tough decisions,"" Brown said of the move not to fight the cancellation. ""That's one of them I had to make.""  The US Government Publishing Office determined  Tribute Contracting was ineligible for contracts  for the organization until January 7, 2019, a decision that was flagged on a government database online.  The decision came after a dispute over production of 3,000 tote bags with US Marine Corps logos. A 2015 inspector general report found Tribute Contracting failed ""to comply with explicit requirements of the purchase order with regard to both printing and shipping.""  The online record on  SAM.gov , the official US government system for award management, states that ""agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to renew, place new orders with, or otherwise extend the duration of current contracts, or consent to subcontracts in excess of $35,000"" with the company.  The record goes on to say: ""No agency in the Executive Branch shall enter into, renew, or extend primary or lower tier covered transactions to a participant or principal determined ineligible unless the head of the awarding agency grants a compelling reasons exception in writing.""  Tribute Contracting's ineligibility, however, is marked as only effective within the Government Publishing Office, the reason FEMA argues it does not apply to its agency.  FEMA insists Tribute Contracting was properly vetted. Brown said FEMA never asked about the company's prior dispute with the Government Publishing Office. ""While it would be inappropriate to comment on the pending appeal with the contractor in question, FEMA continues to provide meals to survivors in Puerto Rico,"" William Booher, FEMA public affairs director, told CNN in an email. ""At the time of the contract termination there were ample commodity supplies in the pipeline, and distribution was not affected."" On the same day Tribute Contracting's contract was terminated,  CNN's reporting indicated  relief workers were struggling ""to move supplies like food, water and medicine to those in need throughout the island.""  Bernardo ""Betito"" Marquez, mayor of Toa Baja, told CNN his municipality of about 80,000 residents in northern Puerto Rico were still struggling with food and water shortages in late October.  ""We were in the middle of the crisis (on October 23),"" he said. ""Floods were catastrophic. Those were critical moments."" In emails between Tribute Contracting and FEMA that Brown shared with CNN, FEMA took issue with meals that didn't come packaged with heaters required for consumption. In a phone conversation on October 23, recorded and provided by Brown, a man identified the individuals on the other line as ""the FEMA crew."" According to Brown, FEMA initiated the call to talk about the contract.  A woman from FEMA indicates other contractors were turned away for the same packaging issue.  ""There were vendors who got disapproved because those meals were not together and, to be fair to all vendors, we made sure all meals were together, all heater meals are together,""  the FEMA employee can be heard saying. ""The meal and the heater is in one package because there is no way we expect Puerto Rico to basically go to one box and grab a heater and go to another box and grab a meal. So yes, we asked you to turn them around for the logistics of Puerto Rico and the survivors."" FEMA did not respond to CNN's questions about the recorded call.  In emails provided by Brown, FEMA also indicated another problem stemmed from ""use of an unauthorized subcontractor."" According to Brown, Tribute Contracting's initial proposal planned to use a subcontractor out of Canada. When the subcontractor could not meet the deadline, Brown said, she turned to two other subcontractors: Cooking With a Star from an Atlanta suburb and Breedlove Foods Inc. from Lubbock, Texas. On October 19, as 72,000 meals prepared by Breedlove were en route for shipment to Puerto Rico, FEMA sent Brown an email saying, ""(D)o not ship another meal. Your contract is terminated.""  Nineteen minutes later, after Brown tried to remedy the situation, FEMA reiterated in another email, ""Again, your contract is terminated."" Breedlove Foods CEO Bill Miller told CNN that he still has the 72,000 meals in a warehouse. The nonprofit organization said it has provided food during disaster response in Haiti and Texas. Miller said he has never had a problem such as this and said he believes the cancellation caused delays in getting relief to Puerto Rico. He said he takes issue with Tribute Contracting but didn't elaborate. The other subcontractor, Cooking With a Star, said it had an additional 75,000 meals ready for shipment, and food to prep another 100,000 meals, when the contract was canceled. ""It became more of a civic duty than anything to help out our brothers in need,"" Cooking With a Star Owner Kendra Robinson said. ""We were all excited about the opportunity to help and be there for Puerto Ricans in the way of food."" Brown said she has learned a lot of lessons in working with the federal government. In their letter to Gowdy, Cummings and Plaskett said they worry enough lessons have not been learned in the response to Hurricane Maria. Cummings and Plaskett expressed frustration over a lack of response from FEMA after an October request to the Department of Homeland Security for documents or communications on Hurricanes Maria and Irma as they related to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the committee. The two Democrats confirmed that DHS provided information on behalf of FEMA but did not include emails or other communications on the subject as requested.   In response, a representative for the Oversight Committee, said Tuesday that the panel ""has been receiving regular bipartisan briefings from DHS and FEMA on the status of our requests spanning back to our initial bipartisan request on October 11.""  ""At no point -- until today's letter -- has this concern been raised. While sending a subpoena to cooperating agencies is premature, we look forward to continuing our review of the preparation and recovery efforts relating to the 2017 hurricanes."" The next Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1.  ""There are sufficient commodities both in Puerto Rico and on the mainland to continue to meet identified needs for current or future disaster,"" FEMA's Booher said.  Last week, FEMA was forced to  clarify plans to transition  from its response phase to recovery mode after confusion about the distribution of supplies in Puerto Rico. FEMA confirmed to CNN it doesn't have any plans to send any new shipments of food or water to the island, but distribution of its stockpile continues.   FEMA told CNN the agency has provided 60 million meals to survivors in Puerto Rico, and 4 million meals and snacks remain stockpiled on the island for distribution.  ""FEMA was slow,"" said Marquez, the Toa Baja mayor. ""But things improved. We are still receiving aid, water from FEMA today.""  According to the mayor, his municipality now has water, and 85% of residents have power. They have also cleaned up 95% of debris.  But full recovery after Maria, as Marquez sees it, will take time.  "" Poco a poco  (little by little),"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/06/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-meals/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjmjL7J28j6AhXobDABHYsGA-04WhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw1J7UziaOKgY1Delq0nSiac,CNN,Liberal
115,San Juan mayor: Trump's words on Puerto Rico are 'utter hypocrisy',Alexandra King,2/1/18," San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz didn't mince her words Wednesday when asked about President Donald Trump's pledges of support to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico during his State of the Union speech, denouncing them as ""hypocrisy."" ""To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California and everywhere else -- we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together,"" Trump said Tuesday. But asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour about Trump's comments, Yulín Cruz said, ""The President has not been with the people of Puerto Rico,"" and that his words were an ""utter statement of hypocrisy."" ""Thirty-five percent of our people do not have electricity. Our children are going to school only part time. Half a million homes are totally disrupted, either need to be rebuilt completely or need to have their roof put back on,"" she said of the damage from hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left more than 3 million Puerto Ricans in need of assistance.  In September, Trump repeatedly criticized Cruz on Twitter after she accused the government of abandoning Puerto Rico. It's clear there's still no love lost between the two. As far as Yulín Cruz is concerned, she told Amanpour, Trump ""speaks out of both sides of his mouth."" ""On the one hand, he says he wants to help Puerto Rico. On the other hand, he imposed a 20% income tax on every good and service that comes from Puerto Rico into the United States. On the one hand, he says we will be with you for the long run. And on the other hand, the [Food and Drug Administration] is trying to convince pharmaceutical companies to leave Puerto Rico,"" she told Amanpour. ""He says he cares and he came here and threw paper towels at us,"" she continued, referring to Trump's visit to the city of Guaynabo in October. ""And on the other hand, he doesn't provide his administration with a clear set of goals to help Puerto Rico."" Yulín Cruz also slammed the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which announced plans this week to halt new shipments of food and water to the island by the end of January.  ""FEMA said mission accomplished. I do not know what mission they have accomplished, Certainly, it wasn't the mission of doing what they were supposed to do,"" Yulín Cruz said. The  agency said Wednesday  that distribution of supplies already stockpiled on the island will continue.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/san-juan-mayor-trump-hypocrisy-cnntv/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjusta46sj6AhVspIQIHYthDb848AEQFnoECAgQAg&usg=AOvVaw2wALRNZAyRx3WP94J0xfyu,CNN,Liberal
116,La Ruta De María: A journey along the path of the hurricane,John D. Sutter,2/1/18," Each morning before work, Héctor Luis Rodríguez Nieves showers with a garden hose behind his tattered home. He uses the jungle as his restroom. He sleeps on a mattress in what once was the kitchen. Above the bed, clothes hang from the rafters -- like Spanish moss from trees. The floor in his old bedroom turned to cardboard and sags like a trampoline. A hole opened up. Few places in the house stay dry. That's because, three months after Hurricane Maria, he still doesn't have a functional roof. Others might have given up, or moved away, but Rodríguez, a 35-year-old with boyish freckles and a ruler-straight hairline, lived in this house as a child. After his father passed away a few years ago, he says, he moved back in. This is home; he doesn't want to leave. So he's saving up paychecks from his part-time hardware store job to buy cinder blocks to rebuild. A couple dozen or so are piled in the yard. And he tried to install a tarp on his own. It doesn't do much. What's brought me to Rodríguez's house in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, on December 16, is none of this. It's a yellow piece of paper nailed to the wall, near the front door.  The Right of Entry Form indicates Rodríguez has applied for a professionally installed tarp -- or Blue Roof -- from the US Army Corps of Engineers. These free roofs, which are meant to last 30 days, may not sound like much. They can be everything in post-hurricane Puerto Rico if you're dealing with sun and rain inside your house. Operation Blue Roof is not the only housing program for Maria's victims, but it is one of the main ways a person like Rodríguez can protect his belongings and try to return to some semblance of normalcy.  To qualify, a home must have less than 50% structural damage. Homes with metal or flat roofs, and those made out of concrete, generally are ineligible for the program because of the difficulties of installing tarps on those structures, according to the Army Corps.  Only about a third of people who requested Blue Roofs had received them by December 18.  Rodríguez's house was approved for a Blue Roof, according to a government database CNN obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. He said he applied on October 25.  Yet, when I visit, he's still waiting.  That's true for tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, the records show. When I ask Rodríguez about the yellow paper on the wall -- the prospect of a tarp -- he brushes off delays, citing the crazy magnitude of Maria. Others have it worse, he says.    Then I show him a photo that, for him, changes everything.   I took this image on December 13 in Carolina, about 20 miles north of where Rodríguez lives. The photo shows a warehouse filled with about 20,000 tarp rolls -- each representing at least one house, like his, without a roof. There's another warehouse like this in Ponce, to the south. That one holds 40,000 tarps, according to Mike Feldmann, temporary roofing mission manager for the Army Corps of Engineers, who gave me a tour of the Carolina warehouse. More than 70,000 people like Rodríguez requested Blue Roofs between the day Hurricane Maria hit and December 18, according to a CNN analysis of Army Corps data.  Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still waiting for temporary roofs -- three months later.  Yet only about one third — less than 25,000 — had received them by that date, the analysis shows. The Army Corps' own guidelines say homeowners ""should expect work within 14 days of the request."" However, following inquiries from CNN, agency officials acknowledge the database used to track the work does not show how long residents have been waiting for tarps.  The Army Corps could look at paper records to determine how long applicants have been put on hold, an agency spokesperson says. But the agency declined to say whether such an assessment has been done. Blue Roof installations, according to the spokesperson, are prioritized by location and other factors, not by the date a person applied for a tarp.  ""Our mission is to install temporary roofs on all eligible structures as quickly as possible,"" Patrick Loch, an agency spokesman, says in an email. ""Our priority is to maximize the rate of installations across the entire island, and ensure each installation meets the program quality standards. The number of temporary roofs remaining to be installed, along with their location, is the information we use on a daily basis to drive execution of the program."" As for the room full of tarps?  ""That warehouse full of roofs is evidence that we've been able to overcome at least one part of that challenge,"" which was bringing tarps to the island, says Feldmann, the mission manager. Difficult working conditions in Puerto Rico, including unsafe structures, also contribute to the slowdown, he says. ""We've done everything we can to address every challenge when we have discovered it and experienced it. There's always things that you can do better and as we learn about a new challenge we find every opportunity to make it more efficient."" It doesn't seem that way to Rodríguez, who's still waiting for a roof.   ""I'm speechless,"" he says, looking at the image of the warehouse. ""The Army is immensely big, and there are many people with many talents who know how to work in situations like this.   ""God would cry over this injustice.""   • • • • • Two days before I met Rodríguez, I started driving the route the eye of Hurricane Maria bulldozed across Puerto Rico. I'd already spent weeks reporting on conditions after the storm -- on people  desperately searching for clean drinking water ; on the likely  undercounting of deaths related to Maria and the storm's aftermath . I wanted to see for myself whether life was returning to normal anywhere along Hurricane Maria's disastrous path.  In particular, I wanted to know whether people still were living without shelter. I already knew that tens of thousands were waiting for Blue Roofs in Puerto Rico. And I knew that contracting issues at the Army Corps had slowed the installation of tarps. The Corps had told me as of December 6 that only 26% of Blue Roofs requested had been installed. I didn't know, however, where the temporary roofs were being installed or how long people were waiting. In the void, I decided to try to follow Hurricane Maria's path across Puerto Rico. I wanted to survey housing conditions overall -- not just the Blue Roof program. Maria's eye flew about 70 miles -- through plantain fields and stegosaurus-ridged mountains, shanty towns and pastel cities -- in roughly eight hours on September 20. ""Right now, people don't have hope.""  It would take me about a week in a rented minivan to follow the same route. I set out on December 14. I would hit closed roads and downed bridges. I would see repairs being made but also dozens of houses like Rodríguez's that were shells of their former selves. I would meet a baby born after Maria and, later, the relatives of a woman who died in the aftermath. I begin in Yabucoa, on the southeast coast. This is where Maria made landfall at 6:15 a.m. with 155 mph winds. Three months later, you don't have to search hard for problems.   On the shore, I find a family of five living in a home without a roof. They have a dog named Snickers and two threadbare horses. Loose tarps cover about half of the structure, but Luis Oscar Morales Martinez, 36, and his wife stay awake all night when it rains, he says, holding broomsticks against the blue plastic; they are human tent poles, trying to keep water from spilling into the single bedroom where they all sleep. Other rooms are open to the sky entirely, leaving rain and tropical sun to rot and warp the toys of their son and two daughters, ages 9, 10 and 15. The two youngest have all but stopped speaking because of the trauma of the storm, their father tells me. I ask one her name and she motions for my pen. ""Jailyn,"" she writes without a word.   ""It's not easy,"" her father says, resigned.  A neighbor tells me this journey will not be easy, either.  ""Right now,"" he says, ""people don't have hope.""   • • • • •   I drive from the coast into the mountains. The interior of Puerto Rico generally is the most damaged and least accessible. The valleys and river deltas near the coast grow into lumpy mountain ridges. My ears pop. I come to a spot marked ""Carretera Cerrada."" Road Closed. Workers say to keep driving anyway.   It can be difficult to reconcile the conflicting messages coming out of Puerto Rico. A utility pole has fallen on a home; the family decorated it with tinsel for Christmas. There are crews untangling power cables, but  about 40% of power customers  remain without electricity, according to the Puerto Rican government. Many buildings -- especially the concrete ones -- are standing in Puerto Rico. But that fact only underscores the stark class divisions on the island. Poorer people tend to live in wooden houses, and many of those structures were stripped bare by the 91 mph wind gusts that tore through the highlands here.  What remains, often, is a wooden skeleton.   In a basement lives José Ángel Gómez Ortiz, age 63. The second story of the property was damaged in the storm, and now water pours down through empty light sockets.  Black-colored mold grows on the walls.  Gómez tells me that after living in these conditions he's developed a deep chest cough and a rash on his body. He shows me red splotches on his arms. ""It itches,"" he says. ""Because of their delay, I fell and broke my arm.""   In a bedroom, stuffed animals are piled on a bed.   Are there children living here?   No, he says, they moved to the continental United States with their mom, his daughter, after the storm.  His brother and sister-in-law moved away, too, he says. After the storm, his brother was living in a school bus because his nearby home had been virtually destroyed, Gómez tells me, walking outside and pointing at the bus downhill. Its nose is demolished. The yellow vehicle's hue is conspicuous against the greens and browns of the surrounding hillside. Do you want to move to   the mainland?  ""I'm not going to leave what I have here just to go somewhere else."" • • • • •   Farther inland, in Comerío, another yellow paper.   This one on the home of Carmen Rivera.   That paper -- which allows workers to install a Blue Roof -- has been there for two months, she says, far longer than the two weeks the Army Corps guidelines suggest. It's hard to say exactly when she requested the tarp because the Army Corps says its own database is unreliable -- and because her yellow form was not filled out completely.  Other forms I saw on the drive were so faded by sun and rain they'd become illegible.  ""Unfortunately, we have found that sometimes the yellow forms posted at a residence get wet, the ink bleeds and is eventually no longer visible,"" says Loch, the agency spokesman. ""It was recommended to residents that they post in a visible but protected area and/or place them in a clear plastic binder sleeve."" I first met Rivera in October. She told me then that she'd broken her arm while trying to sweep water out of her living room. It was raining and dark, and water seemed to be everywhere in her home that night. Raindrops rippled across the floor. A cast was on her left arm.   Her home is right on the route the hurricane's eye took across Puerto Rico.   When I see her again, on December 16, her roof is still damaged.  Relatives helped install a tarp over part of the property, but water creeps across the floor and her arm is still in the cast. She's strapped a purple, plastic glove over her hand to try to keep the arm dry. Paperwork shows a doctor did surgery on December 12.   ""I'm in a lot of pain,"" she says, clutching a sling. She sobs inconsolably, shaking, her eyes bloodshot. She looks up. ""Please don't forget me.""   • • • • • I post about that encounter on Twitter, where I'm keeping an open journal of sorts, under the hashtag  #LaRutaDeMaria . Among those who take an interest: The Army Corps of Engineers.   I tag them in a few posts, and they start writing back, providing stats on the Blue Roof program and tweeting the number -- 1-888-ROOF-BLU -- that people can call to sign up for help.  I don't give the interactions much thought -- until I return to see Rivera. I double back because my last conversation with her haunted me. That morning, Rivera is standing on the porch smoking a cigarette, watching the occasional car struggle up the steep incline that leads to her neighborhood.   A professionally installed tarp sits on top of her home -- a blue roof.   She says it was installed on December 17, the day after my visit. Loch, the Army Corps spokesman, calls the timing of the installation a ""fantastic coincidence."" Rivera doesn't buy it. The publicity led them to come, after weeks of waiting, she says.  ""It's so frustrating that I had to wait so long. Because of their delay, I fell and broke my arm.""   And that's the thing about shelter: The wait truly matters.   • • • • •   Farther into the mountains, in Orocovis, I meet a family that already has a Blue Roof.  The tarp was installed about a month ago, they say. Until then, however, they'd been living in a home where water dripped on them at night and mold inched up the walls.   Karla Zayas, a 23-year-old with big brown eyes, frizzy hair at the temples and rosary beads around her neck, was pregnant when the storm hit. She gave birth to a marshmallow-cheeked son, Sebastian, on November 18, nearly two months after Maria barreled through. ""It seems like they forgot us.""   The morning I stop for an interview, the baby is in the hospital with respiratory problems, according to medical records. It's the newborn's second trip to the hospital with those issues, his family tells me. In all, they say, he has spent 10 days in the hospital. Karla's father, Carmelo Zayas, says he was hospitalized for nine days with similar problems. And a 4-year-old child in the house also was hospitalized for five days with respiratory issues, they say. Medical records do not state specifically whether the wet living conditions contributed to the illness. But Paula Schenck, who directs indoor environments and health programs at the University of Connecticut, says wet and moldy environments can pose ""very serious"" health risks, including respiratory illnesses. Installing a tarp may not solve the problems, she says in an email. Water-damaged materials may also need to be replaced. Baby and mom arrive while I'm talking with the rest of the group.  Karla Zayas says she feared for her son's life.    ""He's a baby -- a very small baby,"" she says, ""and I was afraid his system was not going to be strong enough to defend himself from conditions like this.""   The Blue Roof is nice, says Carmelo Zayas, but it came far too late.   ""I do think we got ill because of the delays.""   • • • • •   Others have not survived the conditions Maria left.   In Corozal,  Pilar Guzmán Ríos died on September 29 without the power  she needed to run an oxygen machine and without adequate refrigeration for her insulin, according to family members. Calls to an ambulance didn't yield help because of closed roads and downed communication networks, they say. The woman's sister and brother-in-law, Paula Guzmán and Manuel Morales, are still living nearby in a makeshift shelter, a closed elementary school. They power a light bulb with a car battery and sleep on beds hidden by purple curtains. I met them on a previous trip and decide to return to see how they are doing. Morales says he and Paula Guzmán -- whose eyes are sunken and who speaks only in a whisper -- could move back into their home if only they had a roof, or even a tarp. A yellow paper is tacked to the wall of the house, which is just down the street from the shelter. ""They left me waiting,"" Morales says. ""These guys said they would come in a week or two. It's been more than one month since (then). It seems like they forgot us.""  Morales shows me the home, popping shutters to let out the stench of mildew. A ceiling fan droops like a wilted flower. Images of Mother Mary and Jesus stare blankly across the room.   I ask him where they'll be in three more months, a year.   He seems unable to think in those terms. When they moved into the shelter, he says, he thought it would be for just a week or two. Now they're beginning month three. He wants his family to think he's fine. ""But I'm not OK,"" he tells me. ""There's nothing better than your own home.""   • • • • • Federal Emergency Management Agency offices. Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.   Two press officers sit me down across a wide conference table from Justo Hernandez, FEMA's deputy federal coordinating officer here.   I tell him some of what I've seen.  How is it possible so many people don't have their needs met when it comes to housing?   The island poses unique challenges, Hernandez says.   Other hurricanes have devastated parts of Puerto Rico, he says, but Maria hit all of it.   ""This one impacted the whole island -- completely,"" he says. ""When we're working with 3.4 million people, we're working with every municipality heavily impacted. We're working with local utilities. We're working with the loss of the whole communications system in the island and the infrastructure was heavily impacted then. That complicates the recovery process.""   Hernandez provides a verbal list of some ways FEMA is helping.  The agency has distributed 169,000 tarps to municipalities across Puerto Rico for self-installation, he says on December 18. That's in addition to the Army Corps' Blue Roof program.   The number of shelters, which are managed by the Puerto Rican Department of Housing, is down considerably, to 39, with 551 people living in them, he says; others are being transitioned to better housing. FEMA can help pay motel bills for those displaced by the storm, including those who move to the mainland US. There's even a program that would pay to move people there. When we talk, no one has taken advantage of it, though, according to a FEMA spokesman.  They don't want to leave, he says.  I've met people who do want to leave, but who say the process has been too difficult or unclear to them -- or that they were unaware this FEMA program exists.  ""God would cry over this injustice."" What about trailers?  FEMA trailers are fixtures of hurricane response in the United States.   Hurricane season returns in six months, Hernandez says. ""We're an island. When you have 175 mph winds, that trailer is not going to survive.""   He also cites logistical and potentially cost-related problems with this form of housing. Trailers can be driven to states on the mainland, but ""here you have to put them on barges.""  Delivering temporary trailers to Puerto Rico ""is going to be, first of all, inadequate,"" he says. ""It's going to be unsafe for the families because I'm putting them in harm's way. And so we decided to then use other forms of assistance here.""   I still don't get it, I tell him. I'm meeting people who, three months later, are living without roofs, or without solid ones. It rains on them at night. How is this happening?   ""You can find the people that are living through that,"" he tells me, referring to unsafe conditions, ""but you can also find thousands and thousands and thousands of people that got their money, that got their assistance -- they got their Blue Roof in place. They've got their own tarps in place; (they) went after the mayor to ask for help; (they) called FEMA and maintained contact with FEMA to get the systems that they provide. ""I mean, you can find thousands of cases like that."" That's true, but not for the majority of people who have applied for Blue Roofs. Our analysis of federal data would find only about one third of applicants had received Blue Roofs by December 18. Again, that's about 25,000 installations out of more than 70,000 requests. Those numbers track with information provided to us by the Army Corps press office. Hernandez says some responsibility rests with storm victims.  ""I can tell you the one thing that I tell every survivor,"" he says. ""'What are you doing to take ownership of your situation? What are you doing to assist us in assisting you? Are you waiting for stuff to happen to you? What is it that you're proactively doing for yourself?'""   Many people without adequate shelter, he says, are squatters. ""We still have shelters open,"" he says. ""So there's no reason why they're living in those conditions.""   I relay some of these comments to Carmelo Zayas, the man who was hospitalized and whose newborn grandson was hospitalized after weeks of wet conditions.   He bristles at the suggestion survivors are to blame. ""I moved Earth and heaven,"" he says. ""I've done everything possible to get help.""   Still, he says, mold keeps growing on the walls.   ""After I clean it, it comes right back,"" he says. ""And it's spreading.""   • • • • • Government warehouse. Carolina, Puerto Rico.   Mike Feldmann, from the Army Corps, looks across that sea of 20,000 tarps and tells me that this is a sign that supplies are here and work is happening in Puerto Rico.   Contracting issues and other bureaucratic missteps have plagued the delivery and installation of tarps in Puerto Rico. The Federal Emergency Management Agency in November fired Bronze Star, a Florida company it had hired to deliver tarps to the island,  according to the Associated Press ,   after the company failed to deliver tarps to the island.  That contracting issue did not slow down the work of distributing tarps, Hernandez says.   He says there are enough tarps on the island to meet needs.   Separately, the Army Corps slowed work on the installation of Blue Roofs for at least nine days, a spokesman says, because of a bid dispute over a government contract --  a dispute first reported by CNN . Two attorneys specializing in federal contracts told me there was no compelling reason for the Army Corps to slow its work installing tarps during that dispute, which involved a company, Venegas, claiming that the government had unlawfully given work to a non-Puerto Rican competitor. The Army Corps could have made a simple legal case for continuing work while the dispute was being resolved, they said, especially given the humanitarian emergency in Puerto Rico. In the end, Venegas got a slice of the contract, and work resumed full-tilt on December 13, says Loch, the Army Corps spokesman. But the Corps has estimated about   400 temporary roofs per day went uninstalled during that nine-day period -- so approximately 3,600 roofs in total. The Corps was installing about 500 Blue Roofs per day in mid-December.  ""Ideally, these roofs go up the day after the storm hits, but as we have said many times the level of devastation here, the challenges to getting personnel in a position to assess houses, award contracts and get those workers up to speed in terms of installing blue roofs on unique structures has been tremendous,"" Loch says in an email.  ""We continue to increase the number of roofs installed every day, and will continue to do so until every resident eligible for the temporary roofing has a Blue Roof installed."" The Corps' contractors have about 1,500 workers per day installing tarps, he says.  The project's budget is $200 million.  FEMA says it has approved  more than $880 million  for individual and household assistance.   • • • • •   Meanwhile, tens of thousands are waiting for help from the Army Corps and others. There's the retired roofer with a physical disability. He'd like to fix his own roof but can't because of his hip. While he waits for assistance, the mattress upstairs has become so saturated with water that touching it releases a virtual flood. He sleeps in the living room. There's no power to run the oxygen machine he needs for nighttime breathing treatments. Then there's the family in Barranquitas with a 5-year-old boy. His mother's home was destroyed in the storm, and other family members were displaced. They show me the boy's Christmas list for Santa: ""I would like a motorcycle and something for construction.""   At a shelter in Manatí: George Rivera, 60, says he became so depressed after the storm that he tried to drive his SUV off a cliff in his hometown. He's doing better now, he says, but his wife has cancer and they plan to move to Alabama to be with family, when they find tickets.    Down the street, Luis Rodríguez Ortiz, 47, spend his work days collecting sewage from septic tanks. Little by little, Puerto Rico will return to its old self, he tells me. It won't be fast, but you have to keep working at it. Meanwhile, there's no wall on the back of his house.   In Morovis, a mother and daughter, ages 87 and 58, sleep in the same bed. They've taped a few photos to the plywood wall -- black-and-white images of better times. The ceiling drips at night, they say. They're among the thousands waiting for a Blue Roof. Their neighbor got one, but she tells me it was only half-installed. The workers said they'd be back, she says, but that was two weeks before my visit, and by then they hadn't returned. Not far from there, a woman lives with her sister because her home doesn't have rafters, much less a roof. When ""I feel like I'm losing myself,"" Carmen Torres says, she lies down on a couch in the only dry spot in her old home and sobs. For some, it feels Maria never left, like the storm is still pummeling them day after day. Across the room from Torres, a clock is stopped. 3:27.  • • • • • I descend from the mountains toward the northwest coast where the eye of Hurricane Maria left this island on the afternoon of September 20. It's a place of extremes, like much of Puerto Rico. The mountains give way to fertile valleys where cows roam -- and where pharmaceuticals are manufactured. Fast-food restaurants are open; some homes don't have walls. In Hatillo, just after sunset, I arrive at roughly the spot on the map where Hurricane Maria left the land and coasted into the Atlantic Ocean. It's hard to find the beach at first amid the suburban sprawl — neat concrete homes with symmetrical driveways. It feels like San Diego. I ask directions, and a family points me down the street and around a bend to the beach.  I want to see where the hurricane's path ends.  I spot two headlamps scanning the shoreline.  It's two fishermen. They're trying to catch food for their families. I sit in the sand to watch.  I think back on the drive, straining to imagine these post-hurricane conditions lingering in such a widespread way in any US state -- Florida to Hawaii. I think about Sebastian, the baby born after the storm, and Pilar, who died in its aftermath; about Carmen with her broken arm, and Héctor saving money for cinder blocks. How many months will it take him to rebuild on his wages? Others have lost jobs because of Maria and have few prospects for regaining them. Puerto Rico was in financial free fall -- the government in bankruptcy -- before the storm.  Now it's anyone's guess what's left.  Congress in October approved a $36.5 billion aid package for natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria. But critics say the response has been too little too late.  ""We can't fail to note the dissimilar urgency and priority given to the emergency response in Puerto Rico, compared to the US states affected by hurricanes in recent months,"" Leilani Farha, the  United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing, said in October .  ""After a natural disaster, with around 90,000 homes totally destroyed, people are at their most vulnerable. It's the obligation of all levels of government to act to protect them, and to ensure that lives can return to some normality quickly."" The 3.4 million Americans living in Puerto Rico have little political recourse. The island is a United States commonwealth. It's home to citizens who, unlike those on the mainland, cannot vote in general presidential elections and have no voting representative in Congress. ""I moved Earth and heaven. I've done everything possible to get help."" This is a territory in limbo -- neither state nor nation. A place that's been made to wait. I stay with the fishermen for an hour before, finally, a bite. One of them runs to the shore, tugs on the wooden rod. It's a struggle, but he drops a fish -- big as my shin -- in the beam of the headlamp. This is a ray-finned fish, he says. Too spiny to eat. He throws it back into the ocean. I wait another hour before asking: How long do you stay out here fishing? As long as it takes, they say. Sometimes, all night. Postscript: As of January 1, 2018, 30,580 people had received Blue Roofs in Puerto Rico, according to the US Army Corps press office. Yet 45,125 applicants continued to wait. Héctor Rodríguez was among them until he received a Blue Roof on January 31, he tells CNN.

117,"FEMA ending food and water shipments to Puerto Rico, official says","Ray Sanchez, Khushbu Shah and Leyla Santiago",1/31/18," More than four months after Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is halting new shipments of food and water to the island, an agency official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN on Tuesday.  The island government appeared blindsided by the decision, saying it was still in talks with FEMA on a timetable for assuming control of food and water distribution.  FEMA has called the island's emergency operation the longest sustained distribution of food, fuel and water in agency history, including more than $1.6 billion worth of food and more than $361 million worth of water.  New shipments of food and water will officially stop Wednesday to the US commonwealth in the Caribbean, though FEMA said it has more than 46 million liters of water, 2 million Meals Ready to Eat and 2 million snack packs on the ground for distribution if needed.  ""The commercial supply chain for food and water is re-established and private suppliers are sufficiently available that FEMA-provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations,"" the agency said in a statement.  Héctor M. Pesquera, the government's public safety secretary and state coordinating officer, said the transition period for local authorities to take over distribution should last at least two weeks.   ""The Government ... is waiting for critical data provided by FEMA in order to determine when the responsibilities should be transferred from FEMA to the Government of Puerto Rico,"" Pesquera said in a statement.  ""This has not happened yet and we were not informed that supplies would stop arriving, nor did the Government of Puerto Rico authorize this action."" Pesquera acknowledged that conditions ""in most areas have improved and many economic indicators are showing that recovery is underway.""  This is life for 3,000 Puerto Ricans still living in mainland US hotels FEMA pledges continued support FEMA spokesman William Booher said the agency ""will continue to support any documented needs and will provide supplies to volunteer agencies and other private nonprofit organizations ... working with households in rural, outlying areas to address ongoing disaster-related needs as power and water is gradually restored."" The agency, which still has about 5,000 personnel on the island, is prepared to restart food and water shipments should the need arise, according to the official with knowledge of the plan.   San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz,  a frequent critic of the federal response  to the devastating September hurricane, reacted to the decision on Twitter, asking in Spanish, ""Seriously, are they leaving?""  ""This is the kind of indifference that must be stopped. Enough,"" wrote Cruz, who will attend Tuesday's State of the Union address  as a guest of US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D-New York. Speaking Tuesday at a Washington event sponsored by the Latino Victory Fund political action committee, the mayor said some schools outside San Juan still have no water, power or even supplies of milk.   Nearly half a million power utility customers  remained without electricity as of last week, according to the power authority. Problems remain in some rural towns In December, representatives of the island's Emergency Management Agency and FEMA consulted mayors across the island to determine the need of food and water to their communities, according to FEMA.   The agency said nine regional staging areas established to distribute food and water to the island's 78 mayors will remain open.  Domingo Marqués, a clinical psychologist who lives in San Juan, said many outlying towns still have serious problems with food and water.  ""For some municipalities, it is wise to stop,"" Marqués said of food distribution efforts. ""Some have all roads open, and most of their barrios have power. The mountains are still without power, potable water, and some areas have lost the main roads. This means that some residents have to drive ...  30 to 40 minutes to get to a store when it usually takes five to 10 minutes. The elderly have it worse since they depend on others for transportation."" CNN's Spencer Feingold contrinuted to this report.

118,FEMA stresses it's not leaving Puerto Rico,Leyla Santiago,1/31/18," Puerto Ricans were alarmed this week to hear that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  planned to halt new shipments  of food and water to the island -- and some assumed that meant FEMA was going to stop providing aid. ""Seriously, are they leaving?"" San Juan Mayor Yulin Cruz asked on Twitter on Tuesday. But FEMA was not planning to leave, nor stop handing out crucial supplies, the agency stressed. Distribution of its stockpiled 46 million liters of water and four million meals and snacks will continue on the island. The agency believes that amount is sufficient until normalcy returns. Puerto Rico's Secretary of Public Safety and state coordinating officer Hector Pesquera agreed Wednesday that the commonwealth has sufficient supplies -- though he said the day before that ""we were not informed that supplies would stop arriving, nor did the government of Puerto Rico agree with this action."" 'The numbers just don't add up' Meanwhile, many Puerto Ricans are still waiting for relief -- and some are skeptical that FEMA's stockpile will be enough. ""The numbers just don't add up,"" said Jorge Pratts, a full-time volunteer with Operation Blessing, who oversees the US nonprofit's operations in Puerto Rico. The group has distributed 35,000 water filters since Hurricane Maria hit. Pratts was in the town of Salinas on Wednesday, rebuilding a barber shop destroyed in the storm. Pratts says he still sees people who are desperately in need of water, even in the capital of San Juan.  ""The cry for help comes from fathers and mothers, people in their 60s, 70s and 80s,"" he said. ""It's a very, very delicate situation that we're going through. FEMA is not being sensitive at all, and they're not understanding what's going on here."" 'We are still in disaster mode' Utuado, another mountainous community where Maria wiped out bridges and left communities isolated for weeks, is still very dependent on FEMA's relief aid, the mayor says. Mayor Ernesto Irizarry says 71% of the 33,000 residents do not have power. More than 30% don't have clean water.   ""For now, we have enough supplies,"" Irizarry said. The mayor says they have enough supplies to last about another week, and he is confident FEMA will continue to provide supplies. But if FEMA's stockpile on the island runs out, his municipality would likely face a ""humanitarian crisis."" ""Utuado is not in recovery mode,"" he said. ""We are still in disaster mode because we don't have access to basic services."" He was not able to watch President Donald Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night because he was meeting with a struggling community in Utuado that still does not have access to clean water. Irizarry wasn't surprised that Trump only mentioned Puerto Rico once in his speech and didn't recount any stories from the island like he mentioned from wildfires in California and Hurricane Harvey in Texas. ""He does not know Utuado,"" Irizarry said. ""They didn't take him to towns like Utuado during his visit. They took him to Guaynabo that will never compare to the devastation in my town.""

50,FEMA Now Says It's Not Ending Aid For Puerto Rico Hurricane Survivors,Carolina Moreno,1/31/18,"Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Wednesday the agency was not cutting off aid to hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, walking back statements one of their officials made inan incendiary NPR report on Monday. In an interview with the outlet, a FEMA official said that food and water provisions to the island would “officially shut off” on Wednesday. But following an ensuing public outcry, whichincluded Puerto Rican officials, the agency released a statement on Wednesday saying there was never a decision made to end aid to the island. “FEMA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not stopping the provision of commodities after Hurricane Maria,” FEMA Public Affairs Director William Booher confirmed in the statement to HuffPost. “FEMA and the Commonwealth will continue to provide commodities to voluntary organizations and local officials who still have a need.” “There is no decision to stop distribution of commodities,” the statement continued. “As progress continues from response to recovery across the island, we will continue to support the needs of survivors supporting the government of Puerto Rico.”Booher told The New York Times on Wednesday that the Jan. 31 deadline was mistakenly publicized by the agency in the NPR interview. The date, he said, actually marked an internal planning date to evaluate if the U.S. territory still needed aid.Booher also reiterated that the “aid is not stopping” and insisted the agency was not backtracking on a decision. FEMA’s newest statement, however, comes after two days of widespread backlash. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz slammed FEMA over the possibility of ending aid to Puerto Rico at the Latino Victory Summit on Tuesday. Cruz pointed tocitizens on the island who still have no power, no water and no financial stability.Nearly 30 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority subscribers are still without electricity as of Wednesday, according to government data. Booher’s statement to the Times on Wednesday echoed what FEMA spokesman Daniel Llargues told HuffPost the day before.He said the information the FEMA official provided NPR was not false but also “not completely accurate.”“Nothing is changing on the 31st,” Llargues told HuffPost on Tuesday. “If it’s changing in days or weeks to come, it’s because it has been requested with local officials”“Some municipalities don’t need it any longer,” he continued. “Some that don’t have running water or power, we’ll continue to supply commodities to them, always in coordination with state and local officials.”In a somewhat unclear statement to HuffPost on Tuesday, the agency said both that “FEMA provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations” and that “FEMA will continue to support any identified needs.”“The commercial supply chain for food and water is re-established and private suppliers are sufficiently available that FEMA provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations,” Booher said in the Tuesday statement. “FEMA will continue to support the Government of Puerto Rico to meet the needs they identify.” “FEMA will continue to support any identified needs and will provide supplies to volunteer agencies and other private non-profit organizations who are working with households in rural, outlying areas to address ongoing disaster related needs as power and water is gradually restored,” he added.FEMA’s Wednesday statement does not explicitly say whether there will be any changes in distribution or quantity of aid for the island. State Coordinating Officer and Secretary of the Department of Public Safety Héctor Pesquera released a statement on Wednesday addressing what occurred after initial reports said FEMA would end aid to the island. “We immediately established communication with FEMA’s operations coordinator for Puerto Rico, Mike Byrne, to clarify the situation,” he said in statement to HuffPost. “After the conversation, both teams agreed that at no time had it been agreed upon to begin the transfer of FEMA’s responsibilities to the Government of Puerto Rico as part of the transition process from the response phase to the recovery phase.” “We are confident that FEMA will continue to provide the help that is necessary,” he continued. “Agreements between the federal government and the local government are focused on supporting the people who remain in need after Hurricane Maria.” Sarah Ruiz-Grossman contributed to this report.

51,Puerto Rico Is A Man-Made Disaster,"Charles R. Venator-Santiago, Guest Writer",1/29/18,"Months after hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico, what should have been an example of how one of the most powerful nations in the world could rebuild a territory is instead an example of a man-made catastrophe now moving to the mainland.Today, about 60 percent of Puerto Rico’s population has access to reliable electric power. Access to potable water is compromised. Food and jobs are scarce, and houses are uninhabitable. More than 40 percent of schools do not have electricity. Thousands of police officers are not showing up to work, and violent crime is rampant.President Donald Trump’s inability to effectively manage the federal agencies tasked with helping U.S. citizens in need has only compounded the problems created by Congress’ historically discriminatory policies toward Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican government’s ineptitude at addressing local corruption. One of the roles of the president is managing federal agencies. If the response to this year’s hurricanes has taught us anything, it’s that the agencies charged with assisting the Puerto Ricans are underfunded, understaffed and overextended. Take, for example, the federal response to the housing problem on the island. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers collected tarps under Operation Blue Roof, but five months into the crisis, thousands of them are in storage. The USACE has fulfilled a little more than half of the requests, leaving upwards of 30,000 households without roofs.But the executive branch is only part of the problem.For more than a century, Congress, with the support of the Supreme Court, has governed Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory ― that is, a territory that can be treated as a foreign country when it is convenient for the federal government. As a result, Congress has frequently authorized less funding for the development of Puerto Rico’s economy and federal assistance programs than it gives to states; it has also provided insufficient funds for infrastructure repair.Federal lawmakers, again with the support of the Supreme Court, responded to the financial crisis in Puerto Rico by passing the Promesa Act. It declared that Puerto Rico was not a commonwealth with any degree of sovereignty, but was merely a territorial possession of Congress. The legislation created a financial overview board to manage the local economy in order to guarantee that the Puerto Rican government would pay an unpayable debt.Even before two major hurricanes devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure last year, its government wasn’t able to generate sufficient revenue to pay its public debt obligations (some estimates place the debt at over $150 billion). Yet Congress, while it assumed control over Puerto Rico’s economy and while its financial oversight board sought to impose some of the failed austerity measures used in Kansas and Greece, has simultaneously refused to assume responsibility over the economic woes afflicting its territory.And just last month, while it was clear that hurricanes had devastated the Puerto Rican economy, the tax reform bill Congress passed imposed new tariffs or taxes on U.S. companies that held foreign subsidiaries in Puerto Rico. The tariffs could force companies to choose between operating in Puerto Rico and leaving the island ― and could cost the Puerto Rican economy billions of dollars in local taxes and significant job losses.Unfortunately, some local politicians have also hindered efforts to help Puerto Ricans. During the hurricanes, Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Roselló failed to activate the island’s emergency management plan, and his administration’s response was poorly coordinated. It took him 40 days to assess damages and ask for federal money for rebuilding projects. Roselló’s administration initially refused to hire the established American Public Power Association and instead granted multimillion-dollar contracts to shoestring companies like Whitefish Energy and Cobra Acquisitions to raise power lines across the island. Local media report almost every day that mayors and agencies on the island are embezzling federal relief money, and relying on partisan clientelism to provide or deny local services across the island.The governor consistently refused to provide a transparent audit of the Puerto Rican government’s finances, and is busy trying to distract resident with a dead-end campaign for statehood.Roselló proposed a fiscal plan last week that depends heavily on Congress’ commitment to give Puerto Rico more than $50 billion over the next five years. The plan operates on deficit spending and doesn’t promise to balance the government’s budget for another five years. It also doesn’t include payments to bondholders, which has been a nonstarter for the financial oversight board in the past. The board agreed to make a decision on the fiscal plan by Feb. 23.As for Puerto Rican citizens, some are now being moved to the mainland without the necessary financial support. Under current practices, the Federal Emergency Management Agency assists in bringing Puerto Ricans to the mainland, providing temporary assistance with housing and a small amount of money to help rebuild homes on the island. However, as we are experiencing in Connecticut, the state government is expected to assume responsibility for the well-being of the migrant once he or she arrives. Earlier this month, for instance, 36 families living at a Red Roof Inn in Hartford were abruptly told that they would have to leave earlier than expected after there was an error with FEMA paperwork. (The state stepped up to cover the cost of lodging at that hotel and others.)The humanitarian crisis on the island is being moved to the mainland. What happens when there is no available work, housing or medicine? What happens when a state does not have the necessary resources to absorb a traumatized migrant and provide for him and his family?Private charitable giving is not going to be enough to help Puerto Ricans. Trump should direct federal agencies to work together and with states, and have the government assume financial responsibility over the lives of these U.S. citizens. Congress should stop treating Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens and step up to finance and supervise the rebuilding of the island. Yes, the people of Puerto Rico can and should take this opportunity to conduct a referendum on their own government. But we shouldn’t expect them to take on the challenge of recovering from these terrible disasters alone.Charles R.

119,Nearly half a million in Puerto Rico still in the dark 4 months after Hurricane Maria,Ray Sanchez,1/25/18," Nearly half a million customers remain without power in Puerto Rico more than four months after Hurricane Maria battered the US territory, according to the island's electric power authority. Still, the beleaguered Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, announced what it called a ""major milestone"" in the recovery from the September storm, with the restoration of power to more than 1 million clients Wednesday.  ""We still have several hundred thousand residents and business owners who remain without power, which is unacceptable,"" Justo Gonzalez, PREPA's interim executive director, said in a statement.   More than 450,000 customers remain in the dark, the utility said.  A government website said Thursday that 68.25% of the utility's customers have power.  The utility has said customers include residential, commercial and industrial clients. It's unclear how many individual people continue to struggle through Maria's aftermath in darkness. Puerto Rico's 3.4 million citizens have endured months of hardship since Maria made landfall on September 20 with 155 mph winds. Thousands still await government-issued tarps  as temporary replacements to roofs blown away by the storm. More than 170 displaced residents remain in nine shelters across the island, while nearly 900 others have been temporarily put up in hotels by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   The PREPA statement said it is working with state and federal agencies, including the US Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, as well as power industry contractors ""to execute an aggressive plan to advance the restoration.""  PREPA came under fire late last year after entering into a controversial $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based firm that employed two people when the storm hit.

52,Puerto Rico Moves To Privatize Its Troubled Power Company,Lydia O'Connor,1/22/18,"More than four months after Hurricane Maria wiped out electricity for the entire island of Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory announced on Monday it will take steps to privatize its state-owned power supplier, PREPA.The process of selling PREPA assets will launch this week, as nearly 30 percent of the island’s energy customers continue living without power.“We are taking a step towards a model centered on the consumer; where you can have options,” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló wrote in Spanish in a series of tweets Monday, noting that the change would end PREPA’s “virtual monopoly in the generation of energy.”Because PREPA is bankrupt, the The Associated Press noted, a judge will have to approve Rosselló’s plans. Roselló said the move is a response to the power company’s decades of inefficient operation, its outdated distribution model and its poor management. The island’s power generation system is 28 years older than the standard infrastructure used in the rest of the U.S., he continued, and the antiquated system in place has been poorly serviced.“The maintenance of its infrastructure was practically abandoned during the past decade,” Roselló said. Billions of dollars in debt before Hurricane Maria struck, PREPA had long struggled to carry out even basic tasks, such as pruning the trees that toppled power lines during the September storm. A study released about a year before Maria hit found that Puerto Rico’s energy system was “literally falling apart” and that its high dependency on oil was outdated and risky. But the move to privatize, which has been rumored for months, is controversial.UTIER, the island’s utility workers’ union, has alleged that the leaders Rosselló installed at PREPA have deliberately let the power authority fall into disarray to strengthen the argument for selling off its assets.Others worry that privatization without proper regulation would actually drive up Puerto Ricans’ energy rates, The Intercept wrote in a lengthy report on the subject.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-prepa-privatization_n_5a6660f5e4b002283005c7e4,HuffPost,Liberal
120,Puerto Rico governor announces privatization of power utility,Taylor Barnes and Marilia Brocchetto,1/22/18," Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced Monday that the commonwealth will begin privatizing the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA.  In comments published on Twitter,  the governor said the assets sale would transform the island's power generation system into a ""modern"" and ""efficient"" one that would be less expensive for citizens. He said the system operates ""deficiently"" and that the improved infrastructure would respond more ""agilely"" to natural disasters. The privatization process will begin ""in the next few days"" and occur in three phases over the next 18 months, the governor said. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, known for her criticisms of the Trump administration's response to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, spoke out against the move. Cruz, writing on her official Twitter account,  said PREPA's privatization would put the commonwealth's economic development into ""private hands"" and that the power authority will begin to ""serve other interests."" She   said there was a ""clear"" strategy to ""create chaos at a time when citizens are in need in order to sell something as positive that will be negative in the long run."" According to the most recent report from the US Department of Energy, some 36% of PREPA customers are still without power four months after Maria caused widespread devastation on the island.  The government, at times, was not sure how much power had been restored.  The leader of PREPA resigned  in November, days after the island's governor declared that power generation had reached 50% capacity, only to see an outage leave parts of San Juan without power for hours. It was the second outage in as many weeks. Puerto Rico also signed and then canceled a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy,  a small Montana firm that was supposed to help with restoration efforts.

53,How to Stop Puerto Rico’s Death Spiral,"Dante Disparte, Contributor",1/15/18,"Long before Hurricanes Irma and Maria delivered their knockout blow to Puerto Rico and many islands in the Caribbean, the U.S. territory was suffering a long-standing economic malaise. The human and economic costs of restoring Puerto Rico’s luster are proving far too great for the scarce resources on the island and far too complex and long-term for an increasingly myopic U.S. Both on and off the island, the lack of political will and leadership has left millions of American citizens of Puerto Rico to fend for themselves. Those who can have left the island in an accelerating mass exodus exceeding 300,000 people since Hurricane Maria struck in September of 2017 – adding to the 600,000 or more who have abandoned paradise in the last decade. How can we stop this senseless death spiral and gain much needed political action from Washington?Calls to build back better will continue to ring hollow unless and until serious long-term financial commitments are made to Puerto Rico and its people. Puerto Rico’s Governor, Ricardo Roselló, has requested $94 billion in reconstruction money to help put the island back on its feet. This astonishing sum demonstrates that in the face of climate change, we are in an invest now or pay later world, but either way we are going to pay. The premium on building a resilient economy in the first place is paid back during these complex times by comparatively higher resilience. Puerto Rico’s “ask” comes at a time when the White House, increasingly distracted by the Russia probe and one scandal after another, has requested $33 billion for border security and to build a wall (or at least part of it). The equivalency between security and reconstruction when so many vulnerable communities, from Puerto Rico to Flint Michigan, have fallen through the cracks, speaks to the deleterious effects of fear-based domestic policies.Puerto Rico has the dubious distinction of playing host to the longest running blackout in U.S. history, with many residents not seeing the light since Hurricane Irma skirted the island more than 5 months ago. Today, 63% of the island has electricity, largely in the San Juan metropolitan area. Small towns and villages and, the impoverished, which make up the majority of the island’s inhabitants, continue to face a long struggle. The human toll of an island-wide disaster of this kind creates a lingering war trauma, as people, schools, businesses and the government struggle to regain normalcy. The next big challenge facing Puerto Rico is the impending wave of financial defaults, as banking moratoria delaying mortgage and other loan payments run out. This when combined with slow insurance recoveries, destroyed or abandoned property, will add insult to injury to the island’s economy.Puerto Rico’s already enfeebled economy and banking sector will surely see a wave of property devaluations and defaults, culminating with a wide number of failed banks requiring Federal intervention. Banks, like Puerto Rico’s economy writ large, are facing a perfect storm of a shrinking client base, accelerated by the outmigration of the middle class, shrinking asset values and impaired home and commercial loans, all while coping with a shrinking tax base. These forces conspiring with the weight of the Federally-imposed fiscal control board (whose oversight of Puerto Rico’s budget supersedes the democratically-elected governor’s), along with unsustainable public debt, demonstrates how the Federal government is the only entity that can change Puerto Rico’s tide – lest the entire population uproot itself and move to the U.S. mainland.While the U.S. is losing the reconstruction battle (or opportunity) in Puerto Rico (with the next hurricane season 5 months away) we need not lose the cultural war of seeing millions of Puerto Ricans displaced from their island, much as we saw in the Gulf states following Hurricane Katrina. In order to regain our footing as a nation, we must demonstrate to the people of Puerto Rico that the country’s motto, E pluribus unum, out of many, one, means something. Puerto Rico’s death spiral can not only be stopped, it can be turned into a virtuous cycle of economic recovery, regional competitiveness and cultural and entrepreneurial vibrancy provided Washington acts. The first order of business is to comprehensively address Puerto Rico’s debt burden, which when adding $73 billion in public debt to $94 billion in reconstruction costs, exceeds the island’s GDP by more than 150%. Haircuts for bondholders and vulture capitalists who have been preying on Puerto Rico’s economy are insufficient. The debt must be entirely forgiven or transferred to a Federally-backed vehicle for restructuring. If the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that bailed out Wall Street was a positive investment netting $15 billion for the government, investing in Puerto Rico can also have a positive return. Thereafter, incentives for rebuilding resilient infrastructure, a diversified and privatized energy matrix, as well as shoring up the island’s industrial base, which promotes economic mobility, can be taken seriously. On the backs of this debt restructuring, the $33 billion being called for to build walls can build bridges, schools, a modern healthcare system, a resilient energy grid and, critically, hope for the future, which is the true source of America’s competitiveness and national security. All Americans should be weary of Puerto Rico’s plight. As goes the fate of our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico, so goes the country.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-stop-puerto-ricos-death-spiral_b_5a5d712de4b01ccdd48b5f31,HuffPost,Liberal
121,Puerto Rico's review of hurricane deaths raises new questions,Ray Sanchez,1/5/18," A newly-ordered government review of the deaths in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria is already coming under fire because the man leading it has staunchly defended an official tally widely believed to be low.   An executive order signed by Gov. Ricardo Rosselló on Thursday directed the island's public safety secretary, Héctor M. Pesquera, to head the 90-day review of the death toll since the September storm.  The secretary, who has overseen the official count, has defended it based on the information received to date -- despite mounting evidence that Puerto Rico has vastly undercounted storm-related deaths.  The  government maintains 64 people died  as a result of the hurricane, which slammed into the Caribbean island, tearing roofs from homes and cutting power and water service for millions of people. ""As part of the recovery process, it is important to guarantee transparency in the damages caused to the lives and safety of our citizens,"" Rosselló said in a statement.  The review comes after  investigations by CNN  and other news outlets as well as analysis by academics have called into question the official death toll. Alexis Santos, a Pennsylvania State University demographer who conducted a statistical assessment of reported deaths on the island, said Pesquera's involvement ""could put into question the transparency of the process."" ""The executive order gives Pesquera the authority to establish the process and he has ... been resistant to accepting counts and has been confrontational with the press and academics when discussing this topic,"" Santos said via email Friday.  Pesquera's press officer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In October, the public safety secretary told CNN that the suggestion of political meddling in the death toll was ""horses**t."" ""You think I care what the government of the United States thinks about the body count? I don't care,"" Pesquera said. ""I could care less what's less embarrassing.""  In addition, Santos said Rosselló's executive order does not ""give people a retroactive right for purposes of insurance or any rights they may have if the death is determined to be associated with Hurricane Maria."" This will prevent family members from applying for the federal government reimbursement for funeral expenses.  The analysis by Santos and Jeffrey Howard, a demographer and epidemiologist at the US Department of Defense, found an estimated 518 more people died in Puerto Rico in September 2017, the month of Hurricane Maria, than died during previous Septembers on the island. The estimate was not an accounting of individual hurricane deaths, Howard said, but instead a statistical look at how many people died the month of the hurricane versus the number that normally would be expected to die in that month. It's unclear when the extra deaths occurred that month. Hurricane Maria hit on September 20. Still, the demographers' estimate seemed to be substantiated by the CNN survey of 112 funeral homes in Puerto Rico. As part of that investigation, funeral home directors said they saw 499 deaths in the month after the hurricane -- September 20 to October 19 -- that they claim are related to the storm and its aftermath.  John Mutter, a professor at Columbia University who researched deaths following Hurricane Katrina, told CNN Friday that Pesquera's involvement in the review posed a conflict. ""At best, he should be an ex-officio member, there to provide information,"" Mutter said. ""Instead, he will defend what he did. No one will believe the outcome, no matter what it is."" Rosselló's statement said Pesquera will work ""in coordination with the Demographic Registry and the Bureau of Forensic Sciences"" in reviewing the deaths.   ""Pesquera's involvement certainly reduces the trust of the people in this revision,"" Santos said. ""In the event the revision provides contradictory evidence, he will be in the difficult position of accepting he has been wrong for the past three months."" CNN's John D. Sutter contributed to this report.

54,"3 Months After The Hurricane, One-Third Of Puerto Rico's Power Is Still Out",Carolina Moreno,12/21/17,"More than 90 days after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, at least one-third of the U.S. territory’s power capacity still hadn’t been restored.According to Puerto Rican government statistics, only about 66 percent of the island’s power is back, reaching less than 55 percent of customers. Gov. Ricardo Rosellóinitially expected 95 percent of the island’s power to be restored by mid-December. But the Army Corps of Engineers has since extended the timetable to late February or early March, blaming terrain challenges, logistical issues and a decades-old power grid for the delay.Officials said full power restoration on the island likely won’t happen until the end of May.Roselló “set an aggressive timeline, but we know it will take significant time to restore power to the majority of people,” Jay Field, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, told HuffPost.The immense devastation caused by Maria’s 150-plus mph winds wreaked havoc on an already “very weak and fragile” electrical system, according to José Sánchez, director of the Army Corps of Engineers’ task force for power restoration in Puerto Rico.“It has some aging issues, some maintenance issues, some lack-of-funding issues that all got together and became probably the perfect storm for Puerto Rico in creating that destruction around the island,” Sánchez said in a video posted Wednesday to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Facebook account.Some 50,000 power poles are needed to restore electricity to the thousands of families still in the dark. In an average setting, most crews can install six to seven poles a day, Sánchez said. But in Puerto Rico, where mountain ridges and uncooperative weather often hinder progress, it can take seven to 10 days to install a single pole, he said.“We have hundreds of crews right now working,” said Sánchez. “It’s not easy.”The Army Corps of Engineers is working to support the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which Sánchez explained is “ultimately responsible for their system and for bringing power to the people of Puerto Rico.” HuffPost contacted PREPA regarding the delays and was told the agency “continues to refine its initial master restoration plan,” which was laid out shortly after Maria hit the island.“[W]orkers have continued to uncover significant damage to the island’s electric infrastructure that in many instances requires wholesale rebuilding,” PREPA’s executive director, Justo González Torres, said in a statement sent to HuffPost on Thursday.“We understand just how difficult it has been for our citizens to be without power for so long and commit to continuing to do all we can to ensure PREPA has the necessary resources to complete this unprecedented power restoration effort,” he added. “As everyone knows, the US Corps of Engineers has had delays with the transportation of materials and brigades. That also delayed the estimates.”González Torres was appointed interim director of PREPA after Ricardo Ramos resigned from the post in November.Ramos was involved in the highly criticized decision to award Whitefish Energy, a small firm based in Montana, a $300 million contract to restore the island’s power grid. That contract was canceled in late October amid concerns over the two-year-old company’s limited experience and suspect connections to the Trump administration, as well as the lack of transparency surrounding the contract’s bidding process.Poor conditions on the island, including the lack of electricity and limited access to drinking water, have prompted a mass exodus to the U.S. mainland. More than 200,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida in the aftermath of Maria, with more thought to have moved to other U.S. areas with established Puerto Rican communities.Residents who stayed behind face an everyday struggle, buying and fueling generators that only partially power their homes. Ektor Gomez, 51, and his San Juan neighborhood have been without power since Hurricane Irma hit the island in early September, even before Maria.For two months, Gomez depended on a $800 generator he waited nine hours in line to buy at Home Depot in the aftermath of the storms. Then the machine gave out, and he was forced to purchase a second generator for $2,000 while he got the first one fixed.“It’s a small generator. Every day I have to go out to buy fuel to fill it up, so that when I get home, I can have power to at least be able to turn on a fan to sleep,” he told HuffPost on Thursday, adding that the second generator can only power a fan, his refrigerator and his television.There are around 500 households in his area in a similar situation, the majority of them made up of senior citizens, Gomez said. The community recently protested to officials over the delays in power restoration, and he said that protest is the reason workers began trying to restore power in the area this week.“Our community is a community of older residents who aren’t able to buy generators or aren’t able to go buy fuel [for generators] or change the oil and filters,” Gomez said about why he decided to pressure officials. “They’re the people that are most affected.”This story has been updated to include additional information about the capacity and reach of Puerto Rico’s power generation restoration.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-power-three-months_n_5a3ba4a6e4b025f99e14daa9,HuffPost,Liberal
122,This is not how Puerto Rico usually does Christmas,Ray Sanchez,12/20/17,"  -- On the southeastern coast of this island, where Hurricane Maria made landfall in September, the waves of the Caribbean lash the crumbling foundation of Jose Morales' battered seaside home.  A year ago, the Morales clan kicked off the holidays in Yabucoa with a large outdoor gathering that included turkey and a traditional pig roast. It's an example of the importance Puerto Ricans place on the Christmas season, when family feasts and roving parties known as  parrandas  happen seemingly every week. But this year is different. ""This year there will be no Christmas,"" says Morales, who is 74 and legally blind. ""Those who can will enjoy the holidays. We can't. We'll be here. Living in fear, in danger."" Up the road, his sister Paula Morales, 67, sits in a plastic chair -- one of two pieces of furniture in her living room -- under the blue plastic tarp that has replaced her roof. A small painting of a clown, one of the few things she salvaged after the storm, hangs on the wall. At night, Morales (pictured above) sits by candlelight or the glare of her battery-operated lamp and listens to the crashing waves. Most of her belongings lie in a pile outside what's left of her cinder block house. ""I can't think about the holidays right now,"" she says, eating white rice and red beans from a small plate. ""I have too many worries."" A marathon season of revelry For many Puerto Ricans,   a marathon season of revelry started with Thanksgiving and ends around January 6 with Three Kings' Day, when families hold festive gatherings and children leave shoe boxes full of grass -- the equivalent of cookies for Santa -- for the wise men's camels. ""The way we celebrate ... is not (just) Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's,"" said Cynthia García Coll, an educational psychologist who lives in Dorado, near the capital of San Juan. ""It's every weekend. You have cousins on another part of the island. So the next weekend the whole family goes to the other side of the island."" Hurricane Maria's assault on the island has changed all that.      Head of Puerto Rico's electric power authority resigns Much of this US territory, from urban centers to rural hamlets, still lacks electricity and running water. Even San Juan suffers occasional blackouts caused by the destruction of an outdated power grid. The storm hammered an island whose 3.4 million citizens were already grappling with unemployment and poverty. Reminders of the devastation are everywhere. Still-damp piles of debris and personal belongings lost to the storm. Downed utility poles and trees. Shuttered schools and businesses.  There is the incessant buzz of emergency generators, and the constant smell of the diesel fuel that powers them. Blue, government-issued tarps cover damaged roofs like a network of Band-Aids. Puerto Rico's uncounted Hurricane Maria deaths So this holiday season, as their fellow Americans on the mainland   exchange gifts and herald a new year, many Puerto Ricans struggle just to feed and shelter themselves. ""With Maria, the foundations of society -- the wheels -- fell off,"" says Dr. Domingo Marqués, a clinical psychologist who lives in San Juan.  The holiday season, instead of being festive, will be ""a reminder that we are still victims,"" adds Marqués, whose family was without power until two weeks before Christmas. ""The holidays will be a trigger for trauma for a lot of people. I'm really worried about that.  ""How are you going to feel if you can't give your family a holiday?"" 'We're dreading the holidays' For weeks, signs of the holiday season have blossomed across the island like the green shoots sprouting on trees stripped bare by Maria. Colorful holiday signs and tinsel trees adorn homes and businesses. Folksy Christmas songs blare from car radios.  Despite their hardships, some Puerto Ricans are trying to stay positive.  ""There is no going back to normal. It's not going to be like before. And that's not necessarily a bad thing,"" Marqués says.  ""We're going to be more resilient. My son and my daughter are going to be stronger than they were supposed to be. We're going to have more pride as a country. We're going to be better."" Musician Roberto Silva, one of the island's leading backcountry troubadours, agrees. ""This could be the Christmas that moves Puerto Rico forward,"" he said. ""The FEMA tarps are covering up a terrible social and economic crisis. We have to find a place between pain and happiness."" The devastation wrought by Maria has even affluent Puerto Ricans unsure about how or what to celebrate.  ""We're dreading the holidays,"" said García Coll, the psychologist, who works in San Juan.   Even deciding on a place for Thanksgiving dinner for about 30 extended family members was a problem. ""Nobody has water,"" she said. ""Nobody has electricity stable enough to be able to do it. We are the privileged ones. We have much more than the rest of the island."" This year, the hum of an electrical generators will be the backdrop of her family's Christmas celebration, García Coll said.   They agreed to exchange only gifts manufactured and sold on the island.  ""It will be a different Christmas, but we would not be anywhere else,"" she said. Americans haven't forgotten about Puerto Rico, poll finds The holiday season in Puerto Rico is typically marked by  parrandas , a tradition similar to Christmas caroling in which families and friends gather and move from house to house, singing and dancing. The roving carolers can arrive unexpectedly at all hours and often come inside to eat and drink before taking the party to the next home.  Those celebrations have been more muted this year. García Coll said the season has been subdued so far, even on what used to be lively weekend nights.  ""Many families are really struggling,"" she said. ""How can you celebrate when there are so many of us suffering?""     Still, many Puerto Ricans held traditional  parrandas  in recent weeks. Marqués says co-workers at the graduate school of psychology where he teaches took the roaming parties to rural mountain towns.  His co-workers   raised money to donate solar lanterns and water filtration systems to people in the countryside, he says. They distributed  toys to needy children.  ""They deserve it,"" he says of hurricane survivors in remote parts of the island. ""We're the quote-unquote 'privileged ones.'... The people in the mountains, in isolated communities, they feel betrayed. They feel angry. The government is not there."" A town struggles In Comerío, a town in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, a driving rain did not stop hundreds of residents from kicking off the holiday season last month with a pre-Thanksgiving feast of roast pork, yellow rice and pigeon peas. SOMOS Healthcare, a New York-based nonprofit, sponsored the meal and set up permanent clinics in two remote towns hit hard by Maria. ""More than ever, there is a need for the holidays,"" says Jose Antonio Santiago, Comerío's mayor. ""There is a collective depression that comes from a lack of the most basic necessities."" The first emergency roof tarps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not arrive in town until nearly two months after Maria hit on September 20, Santiago says. More than 1,600 homes in the town had roofs damaged or blown away entirely, he says.   More than 500 people remain in shelters throughout the island, according to the government. But Santiago says that figure doesn't take into account the large number of displaced residents not living in shelters. ""I have some 5,000 refugees,"" he says. ""You don't see them because they're staying with relatives, friends and neighbors. That's two and three families in one house without light or water."" UN experts blast US disaster response in Puerto Rico Santiago said brigades working to restore power on the island had yet to arrive in Comerío, a mere 27 miles southwest of San Juan. ""The slow recovery has led to emotional fatigue,"" he says. ""The official figures do not reflect the reality on the ground."" 'This Christmas will be different' A short distance to the northwest, in the hilly town of Corozal, 12-year-old Ian Nieves sits in the elementary school that has sheltered his family since Hurricane Maria hit. He covers his eyes, fighting back tears, as he tries to recall his blessings this holiday season. ""This Christmas will be different than all others,"" he says.  Ian and his brother Elian, 6, cannot return to their nearby home, which sits on a hillside vulnerable to mudslides and remains badly damaged.  Their school is still closed, so the boys spend their days riding bicycles, shooting hoops in the hot sun and playing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles board game. Their great-grandmother prepares breakfast, lunch and dinner in a corner of the classroom she now calls home.  ""I miss home so much,"" Elian says. Ian recalls last year's holiday season, the  parrandas  and the large spreads of food that included traditional desserts of  arroz con leche,  rice cooked with coconut milk, sugar and spices, and a coconut milk custard known as  tembleque.  ""We had the whole family together,"" he says.  National historic site in Puerto Rico reopens after hurricane The boys also miss three of their cousins -- ages 6, 9, 13 -- who lived down the street but left the island for Pennsylvania about a month after the storm. Many Puerto Ricans have fled in recent weeks to stay with relatives or in hotels on the mainland. ""I cried so much that day,"" Elian says. ""I don't know when they'll be back."" Ian says he hopes to get new clothes for Christmas. Elian wants a scooter and a juice mug to replace the one -- it was yellow, with a smiley face -- he lost in the hurricane.  The younger boy says he recently received a donation of new clothing and shoes but gave some away to friends who needed them more.  ""They have nothing,"" he says. ""They lost it all in the storm."" 'Please come see me' Across the island in Yabucoa, Jose Morales and his wife, Irma Torres, live down a muddy road in a yellow house where one room has no roof. The ceilings in two other rooms appear close to collapsing.   And the relentless ocean waves are threatening what is left. ""The lower wall, by the sea, is in danger of falling,""   says Morales, a former fisherman who lost his eyesight 12 years ago. ""It scares me at night. I hear the waves hitting it. I feel it."" The couple have no place else to go. They live on about $300 a month in food stamps and Social Security benefits. And like the rest of their family nearby, they have been subsisting on rice and cans of Vienna sausage, corned beef and sardines. Torres asks a reporter if she could borrow his phone to call a nephew in Connecticut. When she hears her nephew's voice on the phone, she starts crying. ""God bless you,"" she tells him. ""You know I love you very much."" She's surprised to learn it's her nephew's birthday. She didn't know. She asks him to visit soon, and to bring cake and medicine for her respiratory disorder. ""We've been waiting for FEMA,"" she says to him. ""Please come see me. ... Give my best to your mother. I love you.""   After she hangs up, Torres manages a smile. It's her first in a while.

123,Puerto Rico Governor: GOP tax bill is 'serious setback' for the island,Patrick Gillespie,12/20/17,"The new GOP tax reform bill could deal another blow to  cash-strapped  Puerto Rico as it recovers from the  devastating impact  of Hurricane Maria.  The final draft calls for a 12.5% tax on any income generated from patents and licenses held by foreign companies outside the United States. Under U.S. tax codes, companies in Puerto Rico are treated as foreign corporations, even if their parent organization is located in the mainland United States and they employ U.S. citizens.    
 
  Under previous law, companies in Puerto Rico paid no federal tax on patents or licenses. Companies may apply for things like patents at the federal level, but the taxes they pay are based on where a company or its subsidiary are physically located.   Puerto Rican leaders say the new tax takes away one of the few incentives the island has left to attract and retain companies that might consider going to   other low-tax havens like Ireland.   ""The tax reform bill is a serious setback,"" Puerto Rico Govenor Ricardo Rosselló wrote in a letter to Congress Monday.     It could have been much worse, experts say. Republicans were initially  pushing for a 20% tax  that essentially would have been applied to goods made in Puerto Rico and sent to the mainland. That provision got thrown out.   Congress officially passed the tax reform bill Wednesday morning, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said other measures are in the works that reflect Republicans' support for Puerto Rico.   ""We are just absolutely committed to helping that island rebuild,"" Brady told reporters Tuesday. A committee spokesperson declined to comment when asked if the bill might be amended to exempt Puerto Rico from the 12.5% tax.   Puerto Rico is in much worse economic shape than any U.S. state. Its unemployment rate of 10.6% is more than double the national average of 4.1%. The island has been in an  11-year recession  after other corporate tax breaks expired in 2006.   Puerto Rico has only recovered 65% of its capacity to generate power since Maria hit in mid-September. Many fear that the damage caused by the storm could exacerbate an ongoing exodus of Puerto Ricans to the mainland. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York  estimates  that as many as 213,000 Puerto Ricans will leave the island because of the hurricane. Puerto Rico has about 3.4 million residents.    Pharmaceutical businesses operating in Puerto Rico employed about 90,000 workers on the island before the storm hit. Experts say those firms   will have to pay this tax if they have licenses or patents based in Puerto Rico.  Microsoft   ( MSFT )  also has a sizable operation on the island, but the company declined to say if any patents are held by their subsidiary in Puerto Rico.   With the tax going from zero to 12.5%, experts say Puerto Rico will lose a key recruiting pitch for companies to come to the battered island. Multinationals would face the same tax whether they operate in Puerto Rico or Ireland. Except that other countries don't have the headache of recovering from a hurricane.   ""It takes away any advantages that Puerto Rico may have had,"" compared to other foreign tax jurisdictions, says Glen Manna, a director of equity research at KBW, a private equity firm, who follows Puerto Rico.""That's the decision that companies are going to have to consider in the long term -- whether it's worth it to stay or whether it's worth it to leave.""    Another bill in the works, separate from the tax overhaul, should help Puerto Rico. The legislation would create ""economic opportunity zones"" in Puerto Rico's low-income areas, which would offer tax breaks to companies that create jobs there, among other incentives. The zones aren't guaranteed yet, but text of a bill was presented Monday.   In October, Congress also approved $36.5 billion in disaster relief aid for all U.S. areas impacted by storms late last summer. It's unclear how much of that will be used to rebuild Puerto Rico.   Some experts say the 12.5% tax won't trigger a corporate exodus off the island. They argue that it won't make sense for companies to leave if they face the same tax in another country. And if firms move their operation to the mainland, they'll have to pay the new corporate rate of 21%.   ""This tax legislation is not intended to hurt the island,"" says Cate Long, co-founder of the Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a research firm that focuses on the island's debt crisis. ""It's still cheaper on a tax basis to operate offshore,"" in Puerto Rico.

55,The GOP's Tax Bill Kicks Puerto Rico When It's Down,Jennifer Bendery,12/19/17,"WASHINGTON ― The hits just keep coming for Puerto Rico.As the U.S. island struggles to climb out of a$70 billion debt crisis and recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, House Republicans voted Wednesday to impose a 12.5 percent tax on intellectual property income made by U.S. companies operating on the island and a minimum 10 percent tax on their profits in Puerto Rico. The Senate passed the bill earlier in the day.That means that businesses with operations in Puerto Rico will pay higher taxes than their counterparts on the U.S. mainland, which puts industries and jobs on the island at risk.The provision, tucked into the GOP’s tax reform bill, was intended to stop American companies from dodging federal taxes by shifting their profits overseas. But because the U.S. tax code treats Puerto Rico as a foreign territory, business operations on the island will get hit.Puerto Rico leaders had urged Republican lawmakers to exempt the island from the provision given its fragile economy. Three months after the hurricane hit, more than 1 million Americans there stilldon’t have power, more than 250,000 Americans don’t have clean water, andmore than 1,000 Americans have died amid the insufficient federal response.Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.), who is Puerto Rican and who opposed the tax bill along with all other House Democrats, warned her GOP colleagues that the provision will visit another type of storm on the island: an “economic hurricane.”“Puerto Rico is in the grip of a humanitarian crisis,” she fumed on the House floor. “Let’s be clear: Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They fight in our wars, many of them laying down their lives for our freedoms. Yet this bill continues treating Puerto Rico differently than the rest of the United States.”Velázquez was particularly critical of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), both of whom visited Puerto Rico after the hurricane hit and vowed to help the island recover.“They looked the people of Puerto Rico in the eye and made promises to help them,” she said. “This is how you help Puerto Rico?”Aides to Ryan and McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has said the tax provision would be “a huge blow” that would negatively affect 50 percent of the island’s gross national product, 30 percent of the government’s revenue and more than 250,000 jobs.Nonetheless, House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for the tax bill, including every GOP lawmaker from Florida. Every Republican senator voted for it too, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Rosselló warned Monday that those lawmakers will pay at the polls in 2018 for hurting Puerto Rico in its time of need.“We will analyze those who turned their back on Puerto Rico, who passed a bill that goes against the spirit of the law,” he told the Miami Herald.House Republicans originally passed the bill Tuesday, but had to vote on it again Wednesday after the Senate parliamentarian announced that it violated three Senate rules and couldn’t pass the upper chamber without fixes. Oops.President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on Friday.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-tax-bill-nydia-velazquez_n_5a39938de4b06d1621b042f8,HuffPost,Liberal
124,Puerto Rico orders review of deaths after hurricane,John D. Sutter,12/18/17," Puerto Rico is launching an official review of the death count from Hurricane Maria, which devastated this US territory on September 20.  Monday's announcement from the island's governor  follows investigations from CNN  and other news outlets that called into question the  official death toll of 64.   ""I welcomed recent news analysis on the number of hurricane-related deaths, and that they may be higher than the official count certified to date,"" Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said in a statement. ""Those reports used the data provided by the Puerto Rico Demographic Registry, but the Government needs to (investigate) if the increase of the deaths is related directly or indirectly with Hurricane Maria."" Last month, CNN surveyed half of the funeral homes in Puerto Rico and found that funeral home directors and staff believe that at least 499 deaths in the first month after the storm were attributable to Hurricane Maria. Reporters surveyed funeral home directors because they have access to death certificates and often speak with family members about the circumstances of a person's death.  The New York Times  and  others  subsequently compiled statistics from the island's Demographic Registry showing that the death toll may be more than 1,000. Those reviews were statistical in nature; they counted excess deaths in 2017 compared with deaths in previous years. Experts have said that such an analysis is a respected way to estimate a storm's death toll. Puerto Rico plans to review all deaths that followed the hurricane, regardless of the cause listed on death certificates, according to the governor's statement. The government also plans to convene a ""panel of experts"" to review the process for counting deaths.  Only one lab in Puerto Rico -- the Bureau of Forensic Sciences -- certifies deaths as hurricane-related. Pathologists review cases sent to them by doctors, hospitals and other authorities.  CNN's investigation found that some doctors and hospitals were not sending all possibly hurricane-related cases to that forensics office for review. Most of the cases in question might have been ""indirect"" hurricane deaths, meaning the person died because of the conditions the storm created. Such deaths should be classified as hurricane-related, according to the government. The official death toll does include suicides, heart attacks and other such cases.  CNN highlighted several specific deaths that family members and some public officials believe were related to the storm, which caused widespread power and water outages and cut communications to much of the island. After the investigation, the Puerto Rican Department of Public Safety  added two of those deaths to the official tally.   Hector Pesquera, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, had previously said the count was accurate based on the information the government had received at the time.  Pesquera's press officer declined an interview request on Monday, and the governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for an interview.  ""This is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,"" Rosselló said in the statement. ""The government needs to work with sensibility and certainty in the process of certifying a death related to the hurricane."" The death toll came into question after an October 3 news conference in which President Donald Trump praised the relatively low number of fatalities from the storm: then 16.  Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on  Facebook  and  Twitter . Later that day, after the president left, the toll rose to 34.  The death toll has real-world ramifications. Experts say public aid follows higher death counts. And the families of people who officially died in Hurricane Maria are eligible to have some of their loved ones' funeral costs covered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  According to Puerto Rico's governor, an accurate death toll also helps the government ""identify ways in which we can prevent fatalities in advance of future disasters.""",https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/health/puerto-rico-maria-death-count-review/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwij9IDN18j6AhXUZTABHd_ZAt84KBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw0Le_nFI5ifMufGoTqf5ZGZ,CNN,Liberal
56,Who’s Counting Hurricane Maria’s Human Toll in Puerto Rico?,"Dante Disparte, Contributor",12/18/17,"Puerto Rico is now ground zero for U.S. emergency response and public health efforts to avert a worsening humanitarian crisis. Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean endured near total devastation of infrastructure, electricity supply and, insidiously, healthcare systems, caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to hit Puerto Rico in more than 80 years, was just 1 mile below a category five storm sparing no part of the island. Puerto Rico’s already dilapidated infrastructure and downtrodden people, 3.4 million American citizens, were ill-prepared for this devastating event. Now that relief efforts are underway and the island struggles through months to get the electricity grid back to full capacity, efforts must now turn to the crippled healthcare system to avoid a prolonged public health crisis.Given Hurricane Maria’s strength and island-wide devastation, the official loss of life from the storm at 64 people, is mercifully low, although marred by a growing cloud of inaccuracy. This speaks to the general level of “weather readiness” among the island’s inhabitants. However, many more lives are at risk in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria than during the worst of the storm. This harsh reality is caused, in no small measure, by the otherwise idyllic subtropical climate in the Caribbean, the dilapidated state of the healthcare system, and the slow response from Federal authorities in the aftermath. As a result, reports suggest these factors have conspired to claim anywhere between 64 and 900 lives, largely due to medically preventable and treatable diseases. There is also a corresponding increase in crime and violence as the lines between the haves and have nots have been illuminated by the gated communities with generators, while the rest of the island lives in dark, squalid conditions.Before Maria struck, Puerto Rico was ground zero for a Zika outbreak that affected one in five people on the island. Compounding the already endemic levels of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, among others, festering pools of water, tropical heat, destroyed homes and mold, along with electricity shortages, the likelihood of further outbreaks is high. In addition to the growing threat of vector-borne diseases, 95% of metered households (corresponding to 1.2 million active meters or half of the population) have running water 3 months after the storm hit. Meanwhile 30% of the island is without electricity. For those with electricity the power supply remains unreliable. The scarcity of potable water and the island-wide advisory to boil tap water, which presupposes the availability of electricity or fuel sources, such as propane, has many people turning to contaminated water sources to stay alive, which heightens the risk of waterborne and gastrointestinal diseases. These acts of desperation will likely compound waterborne diseases on the island, not to mention cases of people consuming water contaminated with industrial waste.As with all catastrophes of this nature, especially when the devastation to infrastructure is as complete as it is in the Caribbean, the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, children and people with chronic illnesses are in the crosshairs. In these circumstances, treatable ailments are quickly becoming a death sentence as relief and reconstruction efforts grind to a slow start or prioritize urban centers that are comparatively easier to reach. That patients who require insulin to manage the otherwise treatable effects of diabetes suffer greater complications due to no energy or cold storage, underscores the insidious nature of these challenges. Other emergency response capabilities, such as 911 calls and emergency room visits, are greatly hindered by the limited number of hospitals that are fully operational in Puerto Rico. Of the island’s 68 full-service hospitals, power has only recently been restored and those that are operational are overwhelmed with patient overflow, staff shortages, medical triage and routinely setback by failing backup energy systems.Many communities in Puerto Rico remain landlocked due to washed out bridges, roadways, debris and standing water blocking paths. Indeed, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, reports that approximately 57% of Puerto Rico’s roads are navigable as of November 3, 2017, largely representing the island’s periphery. In effect, these communities are left to fend for themselves when it comes to triaging all manner of medical interventions. Those facing chronic diseases and conditions, have little choice but to take matters into their own hands, foregoing routine care or sustaining medication due to supply shortages. Increasing medical evacuation capabilities across the island as well as accelerating access to stranded communities is a critical part of recovery efforts, easing pain and suffering and containing the loss of life, which remains plagued by troubling inaccuracies. Food supply, like the supply chain for medicine, is under similar strain. On an island like Puerto Rico, getting resources to a port is merely the end of the beginning. In-land distribution, warehousing and cold storage, particularly for perishable items or medications, is critical and in scarce supply. The pernicious effects of the Jones or Merchant Marine Act of 1920 compound these supply chain problems by limiting shipments to the island to U.S. flagged vessels, crewed by U.S. sailors, which compounds the landed costs of goods, including medicine and medical supplies.The more protracted recovery efforts become on an island already struggling with a municipal debt crisis, the massive population exodus from Puerto Rico will only accelerate. Over the last decade more than 500,000 people have abandoned paradise, la isla del encanto, largely representing the middle and upper class and those with the means to leave. While this first wave of mass exodus was caused by deteriorating economic conditions, the second wave may very well be caused by the public health crisis and the collapse of infrastructure. In the humanitarian world, these people who have abandoned their tropical homes would be called internally displaced people (IDPs). When the middle class abandons an economy, they end up taking the medical the healthcare system with them. Doctors who grew accustomed to certain levels of patient care and service pricing, can no longer sustain their business levels relying largely on a base of lower income patients and government-backed welfare programs, which are bankrupt in Puerto Rico. Well before Hurricane Maria, much of Puerto Rico’s healthcare system relied on local and Federal financial assistance to provide basic care.In keeping with the mantra build back better, which Governor Ricardo Roselló adopted for his $94 billion reconstruction request, rebuilding a functioning healthcare system in Puerto Rico requires broad modernization efforts. These should include right-sizing and experimentation, including in how healthcare is financed and delivered. Critically, paving a pathway to a better future in Puerto Rico requires broad debt restructuring and forgiveness, for which Congress and the Federally-appointed fiscal control board must act. Privatization of state-backed programs, such as worker’s compensation pool, healthcare and other entitlements must be on the table. Not only would this pave a pathway toward improved healthcare outcomes, it would also begin relieving the heavy financial burden on municipal coffers. As with energy, healthcare depends as much on access as on affordability. This is particularly true in Puerto Rico, where the per capita income is about half of Mississippi’s, the poorest of the 50 U.S. states.In an environment where traditional insurance or cost-sharing mechanisms may not be possible, yet doctors and medical operators face a dilemma of care, coupled with a flight of talent from the island, radically reinventing Puerto Rico’s healthcare system is in order. As with revitalizing other sectors of the island’s economy, where Puerto Rico was once among the top 10 pharmaceutical development markets in the world with many major pharmaceutical companies having a presence on the island, the path to modernizing the healthcare system can follow a similar route. As with all long-term policies affecting the U.S. territory, much of the authority rests in Washington D.C., which is struggling with a paralyzing lack of leadership and disaster fatigue, following a particularly severe volley of catastrophes.Averting a humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico and leaving a well-functioning healthcare system in its place will take a mix of vision, long-term capital and policy commitments the island has not yet seen since becoming a U.S. territory in 1898. This is especially true coming from a place of so much despair, economic strain, and dysfunction. As with basic patient care that goes unattended for years until it becomes a costly life-threatening emergency, the same holds true at scale. Puerto Rico has long been the sick man of the Caribbean and one of the most neglected parts of the U.S. Revitalizing the island and the broader Caribbean depends as much as much on modernizing the healthcare system, as it does on modernizing the electricity grid and restoring hope. This vision need not be a zero-sum proposition in economic terms, as emergency room visits by uninsured patients are costlier than planned, well-managed care. This much is true for individuals, as much as entire economies. Our disaster relief obligations in the Caribbean, for which Puerto Rico can be a proving ground, are about building back better and fulfilling basic humanitarian obligations to our citizens and neighbors. Band-aid solutions in healthcare will only exacerbate economic decline, accelerate exodus and continue eroding the island’s competitiveness.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/whos-counting-hurricane-marias-human-toll-in-puerto_b_5a388564e4b0578d1beb7253,HuffPost,Liberal
57,More than a Natural Disaster: Puerto Rico in the Aftermath of History's Storm,"Blake C. Scott, Contributor",12/12/17,"Co-Authored with Bárbara I. Abadía-RexachA “NATURAL” DISASTER?September 20, 2017 is now part of the collective memory of the Puerto Rican people, both on and off the island. For 12 straight hours, each of the 78 municipalities that make up the archipelago endured catastrophic winds and relentless rain. Today we speak of a Puerto Rico before-and-after Hurricane María.Despite all the warnings of potential disaster, there was no way to prepare (in the short-term) for the fury of a Category 4 hurricane, with winds surpassing 150 miles per hour. Modern Puerto Rico was not built, or maintained, to withstand it.The storm’s devastation exposed entire communities to the elements. The island’s electrical, water, and telecommunications services – as the hurricane-chasing media reported – collapsed. María revealed the fragility of the commonwealth’s government, laying bare its lack of organization and resources. It also revived long-running debates about the status of the island:Is Puerto Rico a colony of the United States? Or, are Puerto Ricans really U.S. citizens with all the rights that should entail? ISLAND IN THE DARKOne year earlier, on September 21, 2016, Puerto Ricans were also left in the dark, following the failure of the Aguirre Central Thermoelectric plant. Located in the southern part of the island, but serving the northern and more urban coast, the Aguirre plant failure affected some 1.5 million residents. There was much speculation as to the cause of the blackout. The open secret, however, was that lagging maintenance, as well as the precarious and vulnerable state of the electrical server, had thrown nearly half the population into modern darkness. The commonwealth government, in an effort to deal with its debt crisis, reduced both the budget and the number of line workers maintaining the electrical grid. As Iván Sánchez Almodóvar, a former employee of the now bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), told us: “The intention, from the central government, is to privatize the agency. They started with the reduction of employees, from 9,000 down to 6,500.” Since 2012, PREPA, which serves the entire island’s energy needs, has lost more than 30 percent of its workers.Hurricane or not, Puerto Rico’s infrastructure has been on the verge of disaster for not only a year, but perhaps decades. This year, in the throes of hurricane season, the memory of that blackout haunted residents anticipating Hurricane Irma. Arriving on September 6, just two weeks before its more punishing successor, Irma hit the island municipality of Culebra and the city of Loíza, before shifting north to the Gulf of Mexico and eventually arriving to the U.S. mainland. Only a small section of the island experienced the fierce and howling winds of the storm. Nevertheless, thousands of Puerto Ricans lost electricity. Many of those communities have been without power since Irma; over 3 months later.When María approached the island then, there was recent precedent for an island-wide blackout. On the eve of landfall, government authorities cut utility services as a preventative measure. Hurricane María would arrive to a Puerto Rico already without electricity or running water. Eighty-five days later some 35% of the population remains in that condition, according to government authorities.MARÍA’S AFTERMATH?Hurricane María’s winds weakened in the time between making landfall near Yabucoa on the southeast coast of the island and its exit through Camuy on the northwest coast. But that encounter with the land did not seem to matter. The country entered a shared state of emergency.The next day, with the rain and wind gone, mile-long lines of cars formed waiting for gasoline and diesel. Other people stood in long queues to buy food, water, and ice. A war, it seemed, had just ended, and Puerto Ricans were its refugees. Stores, with no way to process credit cards or food stamps, turned desperate customers away. Meanwhile the banks ran out of cash. System collapse.The U.S. Navy sent its hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, to help. Sailing from Norfolk, Virginia to the island the ship arrived, however, on October 3 some two weeks after the storm. San Juan’s emergency generators, in the meantime, went without the necessary diesel to operate clinics, surgical rooms, and dialysis centers. There was also a shortage of medicine. There were, for example, no tetanus shots available. In lieu of the lack of medical services, the death count of 62 people originally associated with Hurricane María is what some would call real “fake news.” As the Center of Investigative Journalism in San Juan reported, and most recently the New York Times, the true cost may be over a thousand lives. The breakdown of telecommunication services also increased fear and anxiety. In the aftermath of the storm, friends and families were unable to reach loved ones on and off the island. Telephone servers were destroyed, and many communities did not have satellite telephones to reach the central government or neighboring cities. Despite being on an island no bigger than the state of Connecticut, residents were cut off from the island’s government and the outside world. Radio transmitters lost their antennas to the wind; only one station stayed on the air to report the unfolding disaster. Although U.S. citizens, being able to communicate with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) became a privilege reserved for the fortunate few.Amidst this backdrop, came the remilitarization of the country – with lines of military vehicles and members of the U.S. Armed Forces bearing automatic weapons at gas stations and hospitals. Adjacent to these soldiers, Puerto Ricans cleared paths, shared stories of tragedy and solidarity, and helped one another begin the slow process of reorganizing life. It was as if the ghost of 1898 had come back again. For many, the solution has been to leave. The island’s decade long demographic decline has intensified. Elderly people have fled in search of medical attention; parents, thinking about their children’s future, have uprooted to the mainland. Since the hurricane, an estimated 200,000 people have emigrated to Florida and other mainland states.¡ESTAMOS BIEN! / WE ARE DOING OK!Some three months later, although hurricane season has ended, the island territory continues to be ravaged by a number of storms (now human-directed). As the oldest colony in the world (1508 to the present), Puerto Rico has been exploited repeatedly. Although meteorologists can predict – with remarkable precision – when a hurricane might affect a given territory, the American government failed (or chose not) to coordinate rescue teams and preventative aid. While mainland storm victims in places like Houston and Miami received immediate support, Puerto Ricans were in limbo for weeks, unsure if and when federal aid might arrive. It seems Puerto Ricans can serve and die for the nation, but be forgotten in times of domestic crisis. The island, as the Supreme Court once declared, is a possession rather than a member of the United States. Nevertheless, Puerto Ricans continue to express that – in spite of everything – they are okay, they are alive. It could be worse; most are lucky. Boricuas (Puerto Ricans) are okay despite the 70 billion-dollar debt that grows every day and the fact that the island flounders in bankruptcy. Boricuas are okay with the elevated unemployment rate of over ten percent. Okay with the schools that still have not opened to educate their children. They are okay, even if the police arrest teachers who protest for their schools to reopen. Okay, even if rampant corruption continues. Okay so long as the electricity returns. They are okay, even if there is no guarantee that the water flowing from their faucet is safe to drink. Okay, even if the island’s forests and biological diversity take decades to recover. Okay, even though they live surrounded by uncollected trash. Okay, even if traffic accidents pile up around broken streetlights. Okay, even if they continue to be victims of climate change, which will certainly grow worse under a government that denies science. Boricuas – our brothers and sisters – are okay because to live in this ancient colony requires accepting instability, scarcity, and second-class citizenship.The new meme – #PuertoRicoSeLevanta (#PuertoRicoRises)- still depends on whether the empire will release its tentacles and lift the 100-year-old de facto embargo, the Jones Act. Under and around this state of twenty-first century injustice, the Puerto Rican diaspora, stretching from universities and organizations in the United States and the Americas, has created an overwhelming sense of hurricane solidarity. The people of Puerto Rico have weathered many storms before – colonial, natural, and as witnessed with Maria, dangerous combinations of the two. Perhaps it is because of this history of suffering and resilience that Puerto Ricans are still able to say, “We will be okay.” Today, though, there is a new sense of urgency. The inalienable rights and wellbeing of 3 million U.S. citizens inhabiting the Puerto Rican archipelago can no longer be denied by corrupt politics and outdated colonial ways of thinking. Puerto Rico will rise again. But how, remains uncertain…",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/more-than-a-natural-disaster-puerto-rico-in-the-aftermath_b_5a2bf00de4b04e0bc8f3b4e9,HuffPost,Liberal
125,"GOP tax bill 'devastating for Puerto Rico,' San Juan mayor says",Patrick Gillespie,11/30/17,"The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, has a message for House Republicans: Your tax bill would crush us.  ""It's devastating for Puerto Rico,"" Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told CNNMoney on Tuesday. ""It would kill any chance we have of putting together a plan for sustained growth that would repopulate the island.""    
 
  The House GOP bill has a provision that Puerto Rican leaders say amounts to a tax on goods manufactured on the island and exported to the mainland United States.   The bill would apply a 20% excise tax to payments made by companies on the mainland to their subsidiary businesses in Puerto Rico. Companies on the island are already considered foreign corporations, even though they're operating in a U.S. territory and employing Americans.   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Tuesday that details about how the bill would affect Puerto Rico were still being worked out.    ""There are a list of options we're working through to try to arrive at the best approach,"" he said.    Puerto Rico is  struggling to recover  from Hurricane Maria, and only 56% of the island's power-generating capacity has been restored. That does not mean half the homes on the island have power. The Puerto Rican government does not provide statistics on how many homes have electricity.   Yulin said the timing of the tax plan couldn't be worse.   ""You have to wonder, what mind thinks that imposing a tax on goods and services in a economy that's in a coma, it's going to help?"" she said. ""That is a mind that really does not take into account the needs of the Puerto Rican people.""   People were already  fleeing Puerto Rico  because of an 11-year recession. Many experts say the recession was triggered when Congress killed tax breaks that Puerto Rico offered companies as an incentive to operate subsidiary businesses there.   The damage caused by Maria could exacerbate the departures. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York  estimates  that as many as 213,000 Puerto Ricans will leave the island because of the hurricane.   That population decline, coupled with the potential tax bill, would make it hard to maintain the island's nearly 70,000 manufacturing jobs. Most of those jobs are in Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry. Leaders fear an increased tax burden, on top of the hurricane recovery problems, would cause companies to leave the island.    Yulin and Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello don't always see eye to eye on politics, but they do share an opinion on the tax reform.   ""If the purpose of this tax reform is to bring back jobs to the United States, one must emphasize that Puerto Rico is part of the United States and because of that the island can't be considered as a foreign jurisdiction,"" Rossello said in a statement on Monday.   Tax experts aren't sure why Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are considered foreign countries under the tax code, even though their residents are Americans. Some surmise that the provision in the House tax bill wasn't meant to affect the island.   ""Nobody thought about Puerto Rico. ... It's just an accident that the issue is arising,"" said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.    Others believe lawmakers will change the language so Puerto Rico isn't hit hard.   ""I don't think there's anyone in Congress that wants to crush Puerto Rico,"" says Cate Long, an expert on  Puerto Rico's debt crisis.    Yulin, the mayor of San Juan, isn't so confident. She praised Democratic leaders like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for hearing Puerto Rico's concerns. But the tax bill has been drafted entirely by Republicans.   ""The Republican leadership has said, 'We're going to change it, we're going to change it,'"" Yulin said. ""But it doesn't change. And there's been enough time already to time change it.""    --Update: This article has been updated to explain the statistic on Puerto Rico's power-generating capacity.

126,Researchers raise new questions about the hurricane death toll in Puerto Rico,John D. Sutter,11/29/17," The actual death toll from Hurricane Maria may be more than eight times higher than the official number from the Puerto Rican government, according to two demographers who conducted a statistical assessment of reported deaths. The analysis by Alexis Santos, director of graduate studies in applied demography at Pennsylvania State University, and Jeffrey Howard, a demographer and epidemiologist at the US Department of Defense, which has not been peer-reviewed, finds an estimated 518 more people died in Puerto Rico in September 2017, the month of Hurricane Maria, than died during previous Septembers on the island.  That's ""a number of deaths that far exceeds what we would normally expect,"" Howard told CNN.  The estimate is not an accounting of individual hurricane deaths, he said, but rather is a statistical look at how many people died the month of the hurricane versus the number that normally would be expected to die in that month. It's unclear exactly when the extra deaths occurred that month. Hurricane Maria hit on September 20. The number is a ballpark figure -- but it's substantiated, Howard said, by a  recently published CNN survey of 112 funeral homes in Puerto Rico . As part of that investigation, funeral home staff told CNN they saw 499 deaths in the month after the hurricane -- September 20 to October 19 -- that they claim are related to the storm and its aftermath. ""These numbers are very similar and so that leads me to think there's something to this,"" Howard said.  The Puerto Rican government maintains only 58 people died as a result of the hurricane, which slammed into the Caribbean island, tearing roofs off of homes and  cutting power and water service for millions of people .  Puerto Rican officials stand by that count as accurate based on the information they have received to date. ""As I have reiterated on previous occasions, deaths related to Hurricane Maria are not based on estimates or projections. Likewise, I have always pointed out that cases presented to our consideration will be investigated and will be added to the death cases related to the hurricane, directly or indirectly, based on the evidence presented,"" Héctor M. Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, which oversees the count, said in a statement issued to CNN.  For weeks, the official hurricane death toll has been called into question by CNN, politicians and other news outlets, including  BuzzFeed ,  Vox  and Puerto Rico's  Center for Investigative Journalism . In October,  CNN spoke with funeral home directors in Arecibo who questioned the official death toll in that municipality . This month, after receiving tips from readers through an online form, we surveyed about half of the island's funeral homes to widen the scope.  Reports of deaths to CNN by funeral home staff are, by their nature, subjective. Funeral home directors do often speak with families of the deceased, however. And we asked funeral homes to consult their records in making their estimates.  The day CNN published its latest investigation, November 20,  Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety issued a press release urging funeral homes to share information about possible hurricane-related deaths . As of Wednesday morning, no funeral homes had come forward with information, said Karixia Ortiz, spokeswoman for the department.  Those who wish to do so can email info@dsp.pr.gov, she said. Meanwhile, Ortiz said, the Puerto Rican government is still investigating some of the deaths highlighted by CNN's island-wide survey. One death CNN reported on -- that of Quintín Vidal Rolón, in Cayey -- was added to the official list on Wednesday night, she confirmed.  The academic death toll estimate has not been peer-reviewed. It was published online on November 21. Still, the methods the researchers employed are well regarded by several academics we've spoken to.  Santos and Howard compared the estimated total number of deaths for September 2017 with the average number of deaths for the month of September in the years 2010 to 2016. The figures for previous years were provided by the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics system. The September 2017 figure came from the Department of Public Safety, which has said 2,838 died that month, with 95% of all deaths being reported, according to the analysis posted online. The researchers estimated the total number of deaths for September and then compared that to the averages for the same month in previous years. ""I'm very sure of the number,"" Santos said by phone.  The final death counts for September and October of this year have not been released by the Puerto Rican government, Santos said. Those figures are needed, he said, in order to provide a more accurate estimate of deaths that may have been related to the hurricane. ""I didn't think the discrepancy would be as high as tenfold, but these people did a good job by established methods,"" said John Mutter, a professor at Columbia University who researched deaths following Hurricane Katrina and who reviewed the online paper for CNN. ""They are likely correct,"" he said in an email.  Joshua Goldstein, a demographer at the University of California at Berkeley, also reviewed the estimates at CNN's request.  ""The authors argue that the number of excess deaths following Maria was beyond normal year-to-year fluctuations,"" he said in an email. ""Their methods appear to be a reasonable first analysis, but the paper's findings, especially because they have not been through peer review, should not be interpreted as the final word."" Santos, the Penn State demographer, started working on these estimates after seeing many of his Puerto Rican friends post about possible hurricane-related deaths on social media. He said his mom, who is a nurse in Puerto Rico, also gave him the impression that there may have been more deaths than the government was counting. The death toll matters, experts say, because it can influence aid and government response.  Families of people who are listed as having died in the hurricane also may be eligible to have some funeral expenses covered by the US government, according to a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It's also a matter of planning, Santos said. ""A lot of people are asking us why the fixation with knowing the number,"" Santos said. ""The big issue is not the fixation with the number. It's more about wanting to know the number so we can make an assessment of the impact of the hurricane -- and then we can have a discussion about what policies we need to change in order to prevent excess deaths in the event of another natural disaster."" ""The healing process starts by knowing the truth,"" he added.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/29/health/demographers-puerto-rico-death-toll-estimate-invs/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi0xcCa38j6AhWbQzABHRKyDRI4ggEQFnoECAEQAg&usg=AOvVaw0mrN--O1Y37Fr1EZ7Z3oW6,CNN,Liberal
58,Bernie Sanders Unveils Massive Puerto Rico Reconstruction Bill,Alexander C. Kaufman,11/28/17,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced a bill Tuesday to rebuild and modernize the infrastructure of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with a massive federal investment of $146 billion.The ambitious legislation, titled “The Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Equitable Rebuild Act of 2017,” would transform the U.S. territories’ energy, housing, education, agriculture, transportation and health care systems, addressing problems that have bedeviled the islands since long before two massive hurricanes plunged them into a state of full-on humanitarian crisis in September.In total, the bill would grant $62 billion to the governments of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to address their fiscal challenges, $27 billion for infrastructure projects and $51 billion for economic development.“The bill that Senator Sanders has introduced in the United States Congress is a comprehensive plan that provides the blueprint for the transformation of Puerto Rico,” Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, said in a statement. “While dealing with all major areas of immediate concern: energy, health and education it also sets the foundation to make Puerto Rico a more equitable, just and fair society for all.”Cruz, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, hosted Sanders during his fact-finding and solidarity mission to the island in late October.“Sen. Sanders also shows a great deal of respect and faith in us when claiming that the recovery of Puerto Rico must be in Puerto Rican hands,” Cruz added in her statement. “The bill comes from Sanders’ commitment of listening first hand to the hopes and aspirations of our people and must be given serious consideration by Congress.”Sanders’ bill already enjoys the support of Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.).Democratic Reps. Nydia Velazquez (N.Y.) and Darren Soto (Fla.) are due to introduce a companion bill in the House of Representatives. Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett, the delegate representing the Virgin Islands, also is co-sponsoring the House version of bill.The bills also have the backing of scores of progressive organizations and labor unions active in Puerto Rico, such as the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers.The legislation nonetheless faces a bleak future in the Republican-controlled Congress.Seventeen Republican senators already voted against a $36.5 billion, bipartisan disaster recovery bill in October that set aside $4.9 billion in loans for Puerto Rico and other hurricane-stricken territories on the grounds that it was fiscally irresponsible. (Sanders and his peers in the Senate Democratic Caucus all voted for the successful bill.)Regardless of the outcome, however, Sanders’ bill is an attempt to map out a progressive vision for developing the islands and relieving Puerto Rico, in particular, of a debt burden that has crippled its economy for years.Among the changes the bill proposes are the elimination of the cap on federal Medicaid spending in Puerto Rico, which deprives the island of the funding it would otherwise merit based on its per capita income, and increases in Medicare reimbursement rates for medical providers on the island that would bring them closer to rates on the mainland. Experts are especially impressed, though, with the legislation’s efforts to shore up the energy and power delivery systems in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The bill allots $13 billion in additional Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for the rebuilding of the territories’ electric grids with “more modern, resilient technologies,” according to a summary of the bill provided by Sanders’ office. The White House argues that the Stafford Act of 1988 allows the federal government to rebuild only what existed in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands before the hurricanes. That means exposed, fossil fuel-dependent grids that are vulnerable to the sea level rise and violent storms that are expected to become more common as climate change worsens will not change.Judith Enck, the former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator in charge of Puerto Rico from 2009 to January 2017, said the Democrats’ bill offered a “fantastic” alternative to the Trump administration’s plan to erect an “old, unreliable, dirty, rickety grid.” “The sad reality is there will be more Hurricane Marias and Irmas in the years ahead,” she told HuffPost by phone Monday. “So it doesn’t make sense to put up the same grid that was devastated by these hurricanes.”Enck urged lawmakers to introduce individual legislation as amendments to the budget bill set to be debated on Dec. 8.“Can this wonderful bill be passed as a standalone bill, or might it make some sense to take these excellent ideas and incorporate them into the budget supplemental bill?” Enck said. “My only fear is that this gets left on the cutting room floor.”Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands languished for decades as economic development hinged on how it would benefit corporate interests on the mainland. As a result, the islands contributed little to the total carbon dioxide emissions of the U.S., which has by far the largest cumulative footprint despite falling behind China in present-day pollution output. Yet the island territories are among the few places in the U.S. that burn oil to produce electricity, and their residents pay significantly higher rates than those in most states. As islands located farther south than any point in the continental U.S., they also feel the effects of a warming planet more tangibly than the northern portion of the country that historically enjoyed most of the benefits of industrialization, such as jobs and infrastructure investment.“It plays into an ongoing story of exploitation,” Catalina de Onís, a professor of civic communication at Willamette University in Oregon, told HuffPost in September. “We see now in 2017 with Hurricane Maria that it’s another type of colonialism that marks certain areas as expendable, as a sacrifice zone.”The recent hurricanes have renewed attention on Puerto Rico’s financial troubles. The Puerto Rican government owes its bondholders some $74 billion and has $49 billion in unfunded pension obligations for its public workforce. The unsustainable debt burden is the product of many forces, including Congress’s phase-out of business tax benefits beginning in 1996, local corruption and predatory Wall Street lending practices.In its efforts to recover from the escalating debt crisis, Puerto Rico has also lacked many of the tools available to mainland states. For example, Puerto Rico’s municipalities and public corporations do not enjoy the federal bankruptcy protections at the disposal of financially distressed mainland cities, such as Detroit.As a result, since the financial crisis of 2008, Puerto Rico has adopted increasingly harsh austerity measures to repay its lenders. The policies have devastated the island’s economy and infrastructure, driving the poverty rate up to 44 percent.In June 2016, President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress passed the PROMESA Act, which was intended to provide relief to the island. The law created a fiscal board equipped to oversee Puerto Rico’s budget and, if board members saw fit, mandate debt restructuring. But critics on the island argue that it has done virtually nothing for the island’s residents, even as it has eroded what was left of Puerto Rico’s financial sovereignty.Meanwhile, in late September, Hurricane Maria inflicted additional damage on Puerto Rico that Gov. Ricardo Rosselló estimated will cost $95 billion to repair ― nearly the island’s yearly economic output.In addition, the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were hit hard by Hurricane Irma earlier in September, face their own financial troubles that predate the storm damage. The archipelago of 100,000 people owed its bondholders and other creditors over $2 billion as of August, a sum that has put enormous strain on the island’s health care system, among other public resources.Still, it is hard not to see at least some political benefit for Sanders in burnishing his policy chops in Puerto Rico. Courting the Puerto Rican vote is important for any potential Democratic presidential candidate.Since Hurricane Maria alone, some 100,000 Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, have moved to Florida and other mainland states where they can immediately register to vote. Voters who remain on the island get to vote in the Democratic presidential primary as well, albeit not in the general election.Sanders, who has beefed up his staff and taken other steps that have fueled speculation about a 2020 presidential bid, has consistently made addressing Puerto Rico’s financial struggles and limited sovereignty a part of his broader pitch to build a more egalitarian and just society. The Vermont senator made a point of not only voting against the PROMESA Act but also speaking out against the law as a 2016 presidential candidate. Although he frames his new bill as a form reconstruction aid, it also provides an alternative path forward from the one charted by PROMESA.  His bill calls for Congress to issue a resolution affirming Puerto Rico’s right to major debt relief, along with a resolution insisting that in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands “any efforts to privatize public institutions must be rejected,” according to the summary of the law. Sanders’ office released a set of “progressive principles” for rebuilding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to accompany the aid bill. The principles, which include prioritizing the humanitarian needs of the islands and addressing pre-existing inequities with the U.S. mainland, provide as good a window as any into the narrative informing the senator’s proposals.“Congress must ensure that these territories not only recover, but that they are able to rebuild in a way that empowers them to thrive,” Sanders’ office stated in the preamble to the precepts. “We must confront the difficult reality that we have neglected these territories, and the U.S. citizen residents who live there, and allowed them to fall behind in every measurable social and economic criteria.” ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
59,Puerto Rico's Farmers Face A Long Road To Recovery Post-Hurricane Maria,Carolina Moreno,11/26/17,"HATILLO, Puerto Rico ― Clusters of bruised plantains and bags of oranges hung from René “Papo” Cruz’s fruit and vegetable stand on the side of the road. The 60-year-old farmer sat in a worn chair, waiting patiently for customers to buy what he could salvage in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.“There are 68 acres [on my farm] and every single one of them is sown ― well, they were. Now there is nothing,” Cruz told HuffPost, adding that his family depends on what he produces and sells to survive.In October, when HuffPost visited Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Cruz said he was confident he would receive help from the government, financial assistance to buy seeds and clean up debris. If nothing else, he said, he had at least insured his farm. “But [the company is] not going to pay for everything,” he said. “The loss was too great.”But when HuffPost reached out to Cruz’s estate last week to follow up on what type of aid he and his family had received, his wife, Limary Perez-Sanchez, 42, said they have not gotten any help from any entity.Carlos Alberto Flores Ortega, the secretary of the department of agriculture in Puerto Rico, blames limited communication across the island; about a quarter of the island still has no access to telecommunications services. Communicating to farmers on how to get aid has been slow going.“There’s going to be plenty of people that don’t have all that information because we don’t have telephones and we don’t have internet,” he said, adding that farmers need to visit a government office to make sure they are aware of all the programs and benefits available to them.But more than two months after Hurricane Maria, Flores Ortega says he believes the agricultural sector has “just passed the emergency phase.”Most of Puerto Rico’s farmers lost much of their livelihood to hurricanes Irma and Maria. Flores Ortega says 80 percent of the crop value on the island was wiped out by the storms. He notes it could take anywhere from 10 months to a year to get back to regular production levels.For now, some farmers are buying imported goods to stock their businesses.“I’m going to buy from [abroad] because there is nothing left here,” Cruz told HuffPost, saying he estimates it’ll take almost a year for his plantains, coffee, oranges and more to be ready to harvest. “We have to sell that because there’s nothing else. What am I going to support my family with?” Assessing The DamageFinancial loss in the agricultural sector is a blow to the already fragile and debt-ridden Puerto Rican economy. Flores Ortega estimates the industry is down $245 million in agricultural products and $1.8 billion in damages to infrastructure ― storage facilities, irrigation systems, fences ― as a result of storm damage.More specifically, he says, the hurricane destroyed 70 percent of the poultry sector’s facilities, killing about 2.2 million chickens, and the dairy sector had about 4,200 cows either severely affected or killed.Flores Ortega says all the losses in the agricultural sector mean a delay in his objective to reduce the amount of food that’s being imported to the island from 85 percent to 70 percent. In fact, that number is set to increase as imported goods are the only way farmers like Cruz can keep their fruit and vegetable businesses running while they wait for the next harvest.While Cruz has not received aid from the government yet, Flores Ortega says farmers are eligible to receive financial assistance from both his department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.In October, the USDA also approved $12 million to provide dairy farmers with money to feed their animals for one month. Farmers must apply to federal programs directly through the USDA, though Flores Ortega says his department is currently helping farmers with the process.“We have been presenting to the local farmers, in different regional meetings, what those programs are, what those programs require, and what all the documentation is and how to apply for those programs,” he said.Herds Of Cows Wiped Out By The StormWhile Flores Ortega says the dairy sector is one of the least-affected in the aftermath of the storms, those farmers still felt their losses deeply.Rubén González Echevarría, 34, is co-owner of a dairy farm in Arecibo, about 43 miles west of San Juan. His brothers Jonathan, 36, and Yamil, 38, also own the farm, which they’ve managed for the past 15 years.“I prepared the best I could, but the magnitude of the hurricane winds was so strong that they broke everything,” González Echevarría said in mid-October, as he showed HuffPost the sheets of metal roofing that had been destroyed on his farm.During Hurricane Maria, González Echevarría says 20 of his cows died when zinc roofing fell on them. Five calves died during the storm as well, leaving him with 125 cows for milk production.While coping with those losses and other effects of the aftermath of Maria, González Echevarría and his brothers still had to milk the cows and dispose of their milk. Blocked roads prevented the company they sell their milk to from picking it up for distribution, but milking had to continue.“[The cows] are accustomed to being milked twice a day,” he said, explaining how they could develop mastitis or other conditions that could disable future milk production.Before the storm, González Echevarría says the farm produced 1,400 liters daily. By mid-October that number stood at 800 liters and is currently at 1,100 liters. The farmer says it’ll take “months” to get back to normal production.“I know it’s a long process; it’s not instant,” he told HuffPost in a phone call last week. “I have to feel good because what else am I gonna do?”In the meantime, González Echevarría has been able to take advantage of the USDA’s financial assistance for buying feed for his cows, but he says his month of aid will end on Dec. 7. He also says he received some money that covers 40 to 50 percent of the cost to fix the infrastructure damages to his farm.“It’s not enough but at least it’s help,” he said. “I need more but until now it’s worked out. Everything is flowing little by little.”González Echevarría, like many other Puerto Ricans across the island, relies on a generator to operate his farm. Flores Ortega says the long-term dependency on generators to run refrigeration tanks for milk and more is a big issue.“That equipment is not designed for 24/7 hours of operation,” he said. “They are going to be presenting problems if they are not given the correct maintenance. If that happens then they are going to have serious problems.”Flores Ortega says he plans to ask nonprofits for help with obtaining generators since the USDA does not provide assistance for generators, “because the expectation is that we are not going to have electricity for several months” he added.Looking To The FutureAt 60, Cruz says he’s prepared to deal with the hurricane’s aftermath. He also expects that it won’t be the last time his farm will endure this type of destruction.“We have to accept all of this because remember what they say, about the [global] warming,” he said. “This won’t be the [last] time that we are going to deal with this. This will keep going. This doesn’t end.”But Cruz says he wants to keep going because farming is “in you, in your heart, in your faith.”“We lost the farm but there are others who lost their lives, who lost their houses but we didn’t lose our land,” he said. “We have to get it up and running. We have to keep going. We aren’t going to give up, especially not Puerto Ricans. We are warriors.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
127,"Whitefish is halting Puerto Rico power repairs, claiming it's owed $83 million","Leyla Santiago, Khushbu Shah and Rachel Clarke",11/20/17," Whitefish Energy is stopping its work to restore Puerto Rico's broken electricity grid because the company says it is owed more than $83 million by the island's power authority.  Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski told CNN that repeated requests for agreed payments were not met and there was no choice but to suspend work. He claimed credit for the restoration of transmission lines by his contractors, even after his company's controversial contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) was set to be voided.  ""We stopped because of the financial situation, lack of payment with PREPA has gotten beyond its maximum threshold and what we can sustain as a business,"" he said. A letter sent by Whitefish to PREPA and seen by CNN accuses PREPA of delaying payments. As of Sunday, Whitefish said $83,036,305.09 was outstanding, including more than $26 million that it said had been audited and approved by PREPA already. Without payment to Whitefish, contractors and subcontractors were also going unpaid, the letter said. According to the company, its work in Puerto Rico has involved more than 500 contractors and subcontractors. ""It may have not been the best business decision coming to work for a bankrupt island,"" Techmanski told CNN. ""We were assured PREPA was getting support from FEMA and there was money available to pay us for 100% of our work."" CNN contacted PREPA for comment and a spokeswoman responded but did not directly address the Whitefish Energy situation. ""The Whitefish contract is under investigation by the state and federal authorities,"" spokeswoman Odalys de Jesus told CNN. ""We will not give more information or statements until the investigation process ends. The reason is to prevent the process from being affected."" PREPA,  $9 billion in debt before Hurricane Maria,  came under fire and derision after it emerged the agency signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish, a young company with just two full-time employees when the storm smashed the island's power grid. FEMA said it would never have supported the contract. There were also concerns about how Whitefish approached Puerto Rican authorities and how both Techmanski and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are from the same small Montana town. CNN  reported in October that the FBI was investigating  the Whitefish contract and last week a congressional committee heard that  PREPA ignored its own legal advice  before signing the deal.  Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló  demanded the deal be voided , saying the controversy was a distraction. And on Friday, PREPA leader Ricardo Ramos resigned.  Last week, Rosselló celebrated getting the power grid back to 50% generation, but that does not mean half of customers have power.  A CNN investigation earlier this month  found entire communities had had no power since the storm hit on September 20.  Techmanski said he did not regret coming to the island and said again that his company's experience in linework in mountainous regions made it suitable for the Puerto Rico contract.  He said Whitefish had done FEMA-funded projects in the past.  Now, he is moving towards their exit plan -- hoping to get payment from PREPA so they can work the last 10 days before their contract is up on December 1.

128,"Americans haven't forgotten about Puerto Rico, poll finds",Ryan Struyk,11/20/17," Two months ago today, Hurricane Maria made direct landfall in Puerto Rico, devastating the island and wiping out the power grid and transportation infrastructure for its millions of residents. Now, a broad 70% of Americans -- with majorities in both parties -- think that Puerto Rico is not getting the help it needs in the wake of Maria's destruction,  according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation . That number has grown from 63% who said the same last month, with the number of Republicans concerned climbing from 38% to 52%. Only two in 10 think the American citizens on the island are getting the help they need in the wake of the storms. A wide 63% say they are closely following news on Puerto Rico, even two months after the disaster hit. Less than half of the normal peak load of electricity on the island (47%) had been restored in the most recent numbers on Monday, down from 50% after a transmission line problem last Wednesday. Updates from the Department of Energy do not currently include the number of residents without power on the island ""due to technical limitations,"" though they add they will again start tracking that number ""as soon as the information is available."" RELATED: We surveyed 112 Puerto Rican funeral homes to check the accuracy of the hurricane death toll. This is what we found. The  Department of Energy says  18 of the 78 municipalities on the island still have no energy. Six in 10 Americans, 59%, say the federal government isn't doing enough to restore electricity, food and water. On the flip side, six in 10 Americans -- with majorities in both parties -- say Texans are getting the help they need in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall there August 25. The disaster due to Maria is expected to prompt more than 50,000 Puerto Ricans to move to Florida before the 2018 midterm elections,  according to CNN's Sam Petulla .  President Donald Trump hasn't tweeted about the island  since October 19 , while other topics grabbed headlines, like the attack in New York City, tax reform efforts in Congress and his trip to Asia. This Kaiser Family Foundation poll was conducted November 8-13, 2017, among 1,201 adults.

60,7 Numbers That Explain How Much Puerto Rico Is Still Suffering,Lydia O'Connor,11/20/17,"Puerto Rico is still in crisis mode.Hurricane Maria roared through the U.S. territory in September, killing anywhere from dozens to hundreds of people, displacing thousands, and wiping out electricity for 100 percent of the island’s residents. While Puerto Rico has made strides to rebuild, it remains a formidable task.Here are some numbers that put the island’s needs into perspective:Two Months Monday marked two months since Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico as a powerful Category 4 storm. On Sunday, thousands of protesters commemorated the two-month mark with a march on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to urge the federal government to increase its commitment to disaster relief for the U.S. territory.55-500+ DeadThe official death toll from Maria is 55 lives, but a CNN investigation into the fatalities found that it may be much higher.After San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said earlier this month she believes the death toll may be closer to 500, CNN counted another 499 storm-related deaths, citing reports from 112 Puerto Rican funeral homes ― about half the total on the island. They include deaths associated with non-functioning electric medical devices and stress-induced heart attacks. 53 PercentRebuilding Puerto Rico’s electric grid has proven to be a slow, daunting task. As of Monday, just over 53 percent of Puerto Rico’s 3.5 million residents were without power, down from 100 percent in the days after Maria hit. Telecommunications on the island are just under 75 percent operational, while cell service is operating at just under 65 percent.1,520 DisplacedThere are still 1,520 people living in shelters after Maria damaged or destroyed their homes, down from more than 12,500 who filled shelters to ride out the storm. In some of the hardest-hit areas of the island, officials estimated that up to 90 percent of homes were completely lost. There are also at least 106 pets still displaced by the storm.  $94.4 BillionThat’s the amount Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and other island officials asked Congress for last week to help rebuild the island’s electric grid, lost housing and other damaged infrastructure.“We aren’t just asking for money. We are asking for what is needed,” Jenniffer González, the island’s nonvoting congressional representative, said at a press conference on Monday. “This disaster has been unprecedented.”$5 BillionThat’s the amount Congress has approved to help Puerto Rico, with much of it coming in the form of loans.During a meeting with members of Congress this week, Rosselló outlined why that’s not enough, the Los Angeles Times reported. He said the island needs about $46 billion from the Community Development Block Grant program to restore housing, approximately $30 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fix infrastructure and roughly $17 billion from other grants for long-term recovery efforts. $74 BillionThat’s the amount of debt the economically beleaguered island already had before the storm, not including an additional $50 billion in pension liabilities. Cruz has called on the Trump administration to cancel those debts and remove taxes on imports to the island in light of the disaster.

129,US general leads troops out of Puerto Rico,Leyla Santiago and Rachel Clarke,11/13/17," The three-star general is leaving Puerto Rico, ending his mission of providing relief from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Troops are being pulled out, too, along with helicopters that have flown supplies and equipment to communities cut off by landslides and broken roads.  Yet government statistics say power is still not on for more than half of homes and businesses, and water is out for more than 1 in 10. Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan recognizes that Puerto Rico is far from back to normal, but seven weeks after the hurricane hit, he insists the time is right to pass the baton.  ""I think we're in the right place to transition,"" he tells CNN on the last day of his deployment.  Buchanan notes the visible signs of difference since he first arrived in Puerto Rico a week after Maria devastated the island. Below his helicopter, nature's green shoots are making a comeback after the hurricane ripped leaves from trees and triggered mudslides that turned this verdant island brown.  He was deployed along with thousands of personnel to offer and coordinate aid with FEMA and local municipalities for the 3.4 million Americans of Puerto Rico. But while the capital of San Juan and some other towns now have power, water and working community services, many do not, and there are so many other issues.  CNN research this month found  entire communities still without electricity , and there are  ongoing contract and technical problems  with power restoration -- last week just one incident on a transmission line  wiped out power in San Juan  and elsewhere for several hours. There's not even  a reliable number for how many people were killed  in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath, and the  island's director of emergency management resigned  on Friday. Buchanan spends his last day flying to Maricao, nestled amid mountains in Puerto Rico's interior. Here there is still no power and he takes notes from officials that three more water pumps and three more generators are needed.  Emergency generators are keeping the machines running at one of Maricao's main employers -- Fresenius Kabi, which supplies blood storage bags for the US market, according to Eric Santiago-Justiniano, the vice president of operations. The company   employs 510 people in Maricao and 498 in San German, Puerto Rico. The generators are expensive and inefficient. Santiago-Justiniano says the company is spending between $95,000 and $140,000 a week on diesel for the generators. ""The big issue here in Maricao is power, being connected to the power grid,"" he says.  There's another looming problem -- the continuing exodus of people leaving Puerto Rico for the mainland where conditions are better. Just in October, 15 people resigned from the company's Puerto Rico facilities. In Maricao, there is still a distribution center for vital supplies, and resident Carlos Rodriguez thinks they will need it for some time to come.  Rodriguez estimates his town is no more than halfway through the crisis, and he is concerned that Buchanan and US resources are leaving.  He praises the Puerto Rican National Guard for a good job, but feels more help is still needed from the mainland. ""That's what I want the general to take away,"" he says.  Buchanan acknowledges the tough situation. ""This area is going to be down for a little while for electricity,"" he says in Maricao.  But he agrees with his orders to leave.  The decision to send Buchanan back to his headquarters in Texas was made jointly by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, FEMA and the Department of Defense. They said the federal military mission was over and any remaining tasks could be taken over by reservists and the National Guard.  ""I have mixed emotions,"" Buchanan says. ""I have tremendous pride in all these troops, all four services ... and they've done a phenomenal job, but the work isn't done.  ""We're out of the emergency phase, but people still need help."" It's not just Buchanan leaving. Soon after the storm there were 72 helicopters flying relief missions. Now it is down to 38, and by the end of the week there will be 14.  That just makes sense, Buchanan says, because most roads are now open and the air missions are not needed.  Elsewhere, a field hospital in Humacao is being packed up, and the flow of patients to the USNS Comfort hospital ship docked off San Juan is slowing down. Hundreds of servicemen and women will leave with Buchanan. But he points out that 2,500 army reservists are on active duty and about 5,000 members of the National Guard -- from Puerto Rico and elsewhere -- are working on the island, too, as the recovery mission continues under the long-term leadership of FEMA.  Buchanan is relieved that the Atlantic hurricane season is all but over. But then there's next year.  ""One concern I have, is resiliency for the next emergency,"" he says.  ""Things are not going to be back to normal by the next hurricane season."" Leyla Santiago reported from Maricao and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Rachel Clarke wrote in Atlanta.

61,Amazon’s HQ2 Belongs in Puerto Rico,"Dante Disparte, Contributor",11/11/17,"When Hurricane Hugo destroyed my house in Punta Las Marias, Puerto Rico in 1989, I had just turned 12 years old. The category 3 storm devastated much of the island, but compared to Hurricane Maria, Hugo was a near miss. And yet, my life changed forever and the ruin was too much for my mother to bear as she raised four children on her own in abject poverty. After this devastating event, my mother and siblings faced the false choice of sacrificing their own future and education to save the youngest in the family. Thus, I became the child the village raised and was the first in my family to get through high school or college, eventually leaving Puerto Rico behind. The slow decline of La Isla del Encanto was accelerated after the end of Section 936 of the tax code in 1996, which once made the island an attractive investment destination, particularly for the pharmaceutical industry. To the day, this tax change marked the beginning of Puerto Rico’s recession and decades of economic decay and mass exodus. Hurricane Maria finished the job, leaving a tragic loss of life that is still hard to count, island-wide collapse and 3.4 million Americans in hopeless darkness.While there is something particularly cruel about being hopeless in the sunny Caribbean, Hurricanes Maria and Irma before it, have galvanized business leaders like Sir Richard Branson, who is leading efforts to mobilize a Caribbean Marshall Plan. No firm can give or gain as much as Amazon from this once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the commons of the future. Led by the increasingly assertive Jeff Bezos, Amazon is a company that can buy Whole Foods Market for $13 billion and erase the expense with gains in its share price. Not only does this firm have an incredibly loyal market following, its investors are handsomely rewarded as the company’s moves into new markets appear to defy both competition and stock price gravity. Planting an Amazon flag in Puerto Rico, would not only end the search for the optimal spot for a second headquarters, euphemistically called HQ2, it would be met with similar market response as the Whole Foods Market acquisition. Here are some of the business reasons why:1. Revenue, tax, and salary arbitrage – Puerto Rico’s Acts 20 and 22 offer mainland businesses and investors who relocate to the island a reduced tax bracket on revenues and income. Compared to the U.S. mainland, Amazon would gain a substantial advantage, while at the same time garnering massive goodwill by modelling corporate citizenship at scale.2. Labor force and wage rates – Amazon’s move to the island would not only stop the flight of talent, it would reverse it, by pulling a talented bilingual workforce on the island and U.S. mainland into the professional updraft that 50,000 jobs will create. What is notable about this is that the comparative wage rate differences between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland (a gap that eventually must be closed) would create a second cost and operating advantage for Amazon, while at the same time creating meaningful employment on the island and for prospective employees who would relocate to Puerto Rico.3. Geographic and logistical advantages – While it may be counterintuitive to describe a devastated island as a naturally advantageous logistics hub, part of the reason Puerto Rico has been slow to spring back has more to do with strangling regulations like the Jones Act [an obscure 1920 regulation that requires that goods shipped from one American port to another be transported on a ship that is American-built, American-owned, and crewed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents] than the operating reality on the ground. Puerto Rico not only has deep-water ports and full-service airports, it is a regional hub creating operational and cultural access to major regional markets. One suitable location is the decommissioned naval base Roosevelt Roads, which boast of its own airstrip and deep-water ports. Amazon has the political clout to fully lift byzantine sanctions like the Jones Act, which was only waived for 10 days in Puerto Rico – barely enough time to sail a vessel from port to port. Waiving the Jones Act would create an island-wide 30% decline in the costs of landed goods, including energy, thus improving economic competitiveness and purchasing power in equal measure.4. Regulatory sandbox – The devastation in Puerto Rico and the anemic Federal response have created a de facto regulatory sandbox that should be maintained in Puerto Rico. This would enable entrepreneurs and businesses to pilot the business models of the future and to do so at scale. Google’s internet-emitting balloons, Tesla’s solar panels and Amazon’s market-wide drone deliveries, along with building the resilient energy matrix of the future, can all conspire to make Puerto Rico the Singapore of the Caribbean. Amazon moving HQ2 to the island would not only tap the innate entrepreneurial spirit on the island, it would turn the growing number of pilot projects into a permanent ecosystem making Puerto Rico a veritable innovation hub in the region.There are many deserving cities and communities who can play host to Amazon’s HQ2, including my adopted home of Washington, D.C. However, no other part of the U.S. offers this once-in-a-generation opportunity to help an entire community break the cycle of poverty, territorial decline, and environmental resilience like Puerto Rico. Better still, like the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, doing so would have immediate and lasting impacts on Amazon’s economic, social, and environmental scorecard that cannot be replicated anywhere else in the country. Mr. Bezos, please make Puerto Rico Amazon’s second home and lets #BuildBackBetter.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazons-hq2-belongs-in-puerto-rico_b_5a067a8de4b0ee8ec369419a,HuffPost,Liberal
62,Puerto Rico's Most Vulnerable Are Still Waiting For Help 7 Weeks After Maria,Carolina Moreno,11/10/17,"CANÓVANAS, Puerto Rico ― Juan Medina-Dishmey took stock of everything his family of six had lost in the storm, sweat accumulating on his concerned brow as he studied the piles of damaged household appliances and personal belongings that lay on his driveway.“The house is uninhabitable right now,” the 44-year-old told HuffPost in mid-October. He said that during Hurricane Maria, water rose up to four feet inside his home in Valle Hill, an impoverished community in the city of Canóvanas in northeastern Puerto Rico.“We lost everything and still no one has helped us,” he said.Four weeks after HuffPost met with Medina-Dishmey ― and seven weeks after Maria hammered Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 ― his family remains in a desperate situation. On Thursday, the Dominican-born father of four told HuffPost by phone that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had come to assess the damages to his home 12 days ago, but he has yet to hear back.Medina-Dishmey and his wife, Juana Ferrera, have a 19-year-old son and three daughters ages 17, 15 and 11. Their youngest has a cognitive disability due to microcephaly, which causes her to have epileptic seizures and difficulty with speech. The family is currently living with Medina-Dishmey’s sister, and has just two small mattresses from their home to sleep on.“Without electricity, without mosquito nets, that’s how we’re sleeping on the floor,” Ferrera, 47, said.The family’s living arrangements, coupled with the lack of clean drinking water and power across much of the island, have Medina-Dishmey and Ferrera worried about their kids’ health. All three of their daughters have had colds; the youngest has been sick for at least four weeks, Ferrera said Thursday. The parents also fear their children could become infected with leptospirosis, a potentially deadly animal-borne bacterial disease.The lack of sufficient food, water and safe living conditions for his family has Medina-Dishmey feeling disheartened. He said his children also “feel sad” when they see the damage to their home and say they want to move to the U.S. mainland. “I haven’t even been able to work and I’m waiting for an organization to give me some sort of help,” he said. “I try to act strong so my kids don’t see me like that, but I’m still depressed.”The family is one of thousands in Valle Hill and its two neighboring communities, Villa Hugo 1 and 2, that residents say lack basic resources, including shelter, in Maria’s aftermath. While several poor communities are still waiting for help, the plight of the Valle Hill area stands out, Angel Marcano, a community leader from Old San Juan’s La Perla district, told HuffPost.“We’re hearing from a lot of communities like this ... the government came once or the government hasn’t come at all,” Marcano said. “Compared to other communities I’ve been to, I saw a lot of need [in the Valle Hill area].”“I saw families that are ‘living under four sticks,’ as we say here in Puerto Rico,” he added.Jannette Lozada Sabastros, 52, Valle Hill’s community president, said she has not heard from the mayor of Canóvanas, Lornna Soto, since Hurricane Irma hit Puerto Rico ahead of Maria in early September. At that time, 79 “small” bags of groceries were delivered, she said.Lozada Sabastros suspects that aid has been slow to arrive due in part to discrimination against her community, where 40 percent of the area’s residents are undocumented immigrants primarily from the Dominican Republic ― an often vilified group.Alaí Reyes-Santos, an associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of Oregon, has done extensive research on the marginalization of Dominicans in Puerto Rico, both documented and undocumented. She told HuffPost there’s “real discrimination and xenophobic violence against” working-class Dominican migrants on the island, who are often viewed as uneducated or criminals.“[They] are very vulnerable because there’s an assumption that they don’t have rights or that they’re not protected by the state,” she said.Residents also point to a lack of transparency from local officials, which has led to little understanding of how resources are allocated at the federal level. The result: Residents are desperate for basic necessities ― including shelter ― with no known timetable for when help will arrive, if at all.Multiple calls to the office of the mayor of Canóvanas by HuffPost went unanswered.FEMA’S aid distribution pipelineFor its part, FEMA says they are delivering food and water intended for Canóvanas to a regional distribution center.“FEMA’s records show food and water have been delivered to Canóvanas and its associated regional staging area, as requested, on a daily basis for the past month,” spokesman Ron Roth told HuffPost.Once supplies arrive in Puerto Rico, Roth said, the agency transfers them to the nine Regional Staging Areas (RSAs) across the island. The Puerto Rican National Guard manages and operates the RSAs and is in charge of delivering the supplies to local mayors or authorized officials. From there, local officials distribute the food, water and other aid at their discretion.One of the RSAs is located in Canóvanas and supplies aid to it and the municipalities of San Juan, Carolina, Trujillo Alto, Loiza and Rio Grande. As of Tuesday, the Canóvanas RSA had received 1,422,812 bottles of water and 430,560 nonperishable meals, according to FEMA. As of Sunday, the RSA had also received 131 pallets of perishable food with an average of 330 meals per pallet.If those resources were distributed evenly among the estimated 697,820 residents in all six municipalities, each person would have received approximately 2.04 bottles of water and 0.68 meals via FEMA since Maria hit.Other groups, such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, have pitched in, but food and water remain in short supply.When HuffPost asked FEMA about the insufficient quantities of aid available at the Canóvanas RSA, Roth said the agency is working with the government of Puerto Rico to assess communities’ needs.“The request of commodities and distribution is led by local officials as they identify the need according to their impacted population,” he said in a statement. “Then the request comes to FEMA to provide and distribute commodities, this is the process for all 78 municipalities.”He added that the Department of Defense has been providing two reverse osmosis water purification units that produce 3,000 gallons of potable water per hour.About a week after Maria, Puerto Rico’s secretary of the Treasury and the National Guard brought 900 cases of water to be distributed among the 1,600 households in Valle Hill and Villa Hugo 1 and 2, according to Lozada Sabastros. But she said Thursday no one has been back since.“It’s been almost a month since any water was brought here,” she said. “There are a lot of families here that have four-to-eight members, one case of water rationed out can last [only] one week or a week-and-a-half.”What’s more, Lozada Sabastros told HuffPost the 972 families in the communities remain in dire need of clothes, sheets, mattresses, food, medicine and even shelter.Thus far, residents have survived on supplies from private entities like Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical humanitarian aid organization that gave all three communities blue tarps to use as makeshift roofs or walls.‘We didn’t expect so much damage’The wait for aid is particularly difficult for those without a roof over their head. Nearly every family home constructed with wood in Valle Hill and its neighboring communities was either flattened or ripped away by Maria’s winds, leaving dozens of residents with little more than cinder blocks to stand on.“Every corner of my community was affected,” Lozada Sabastros told HuffPost. “We knew it was going to affect us, but we didn’t expect so much damage.”Danny Guerrero Herrera is one of the many residents who lost most of their home to the storm. He told HuffPost that Irma shook his house, which sits atop a small hill, but Maria ripped away his roof, several walls and destroyed nearly all his belongings.When HuffPost visited him at his home in mid-October, the 43-year-old was using a donated tarp as a makeshift wall where his bathroom and bedroom used to be. When he pulled the tarp back, dozens of other damaged houses in Villa Hugo 1 came into view below.The flimsy, temporary tarps were the only protection many residents had from the flash floods and rain that came after Maria until the Army Corps of Engineers arrived to install reinforced coverings on Oct. 28 as part of Operation Blue Roof, a program implemented on behalf of FEMA.But Roth, who knows of the program, told HuffPost that even these reinforced tarps are an incomplete solution for many families because they can only be applied if at least 50 percent of a house’s rafters are still standing.In other words, the program doesn’t address the housing crisis faced by many in the Valle Hill area. “They’re not going to put many up here, because the majority of houses here were completely destroyed,” Lozada Sabastros said.Guerrero Herrera and his wife have been staying at a friend’s house since their home was battered. In the interview last month, he said he was still waiting for FEMA to assess the damage and grant him financial assistance so he could tear down his home and rebuild it. “But they haven’t come,” he said with a sigh. “Let’s see what happens.”Contacted by phone on Thursday, Guerrero Herrera said he still had heard nothing from the agency. ‘I’ve sensed discrimination’While some residents in the Valle Hill area hold out hope that FEMA will arrive with financial help to rebuild their lives, Lozada Sabastros said she knows of at least 400 residents in her community who won’t see a cent because they are undocumented immigrants, mainly from the Dominican Republic.“I am realizing that because this is a community of foreigners ― meaning there are a lot of people without documents ― I’ve sensed discrimination,” she told HuffPost.Lozada Sabastros said she is trying to get those families aid through private organizations “so they at least have a place to sleep.”FEMA, responding to a question about aid that undocumented individuals are entitled to, pointed HuffPost to its webpage, which confirmed that undocumented residents affected by a major disaster may be eligible for non-monetary assistance ― including legal help, medical care, shelter, food and water. Undocumented individuals are not eligible for cash assistance programs, though a FEMA spokesman told HuffPost households can apply for such relief as long as any family member has proper documentation, regardless of age.The marginalization of Dominicans in Puerto Rico would be nothing new, according to Reyes-Santos, who wrote Our Caribbean Kin: Race and Nation in the Neoliberal Antilles. A Puerto Rican who has family members of Dominican descent, she said that undocumented Dominicans are more vulnerable and invisible than ever post-Maria. “I don’t know much about Canóvanas but I know enough about how nationalist politics play out in particular moments of fear,” she said. “In moments of fear, migrants become scapegoats.”She said Dominicans have been used as such in Puerto Rico since the 1980s, when the island’s economic crisis began to take shape.“I could see people not helping Dominicans and using nationalism as a way to say, ‘Well, we just need to help ourselves right now and Dominicans are not part of our community, they just need to go home,’” she said. “In desperate times, sadly, all our biases and prejudices kick in.”‘What I’m most worried about right now is health’Nearly 58 percent of Puerto Rico still is without power and more than 14 percent is without running water, according to government statistics. Doctors have told HuffPost these conditions make the island ripe for disease outbreaks.The failure to bring sufficient drinking water and provide clean living conditions has left residents in Valle Hill and its neighboring communities exposed to potentially contaminated water sources or objects that could contribute to a host of health problems.“What I’m most worried about right now is health, because they haven’t picked up the trash and at night there’s a procession of rats,” Lozada Sabastros said. Rats, among other animals, pose a threat to the community’s health since they are known to carry the bacteria that can infect humans with leptospirosis. The disease has killed at least four people in Maria’s aftermath.Lozada Sabastros says that in Valle Hill alone, four others have died from the disease. “When it comes to statistics, [the government] stayed quiet, but I know who died here from that,” she said. “I know because I went to every one of the funerals.”The official death toll from all causes related to Maria stands at 55. Lozada Sabastros said Thursday she knows of about 200 people in Valle Hill suffering from different ailments, including scabies, gastritis and conjunctivitis. She is particularly concerned about the well-being of her community’s children.“The kids have some horrible colds,” she said. “I’m scared for my kids and for the kids here because without toys or anything to entertain themselves with, they spend their time going through the trash.”Hermes Ayala and Alejandra Rosa contributed to this report.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-ricos-most-vulnerable-are-still-waiting-for-help-7-weeks-after-maria_n_59fcb730e4b04cdbeb331e94,HuffPost,Liberal
63,Puerto Rico Slammed By Massive New Power Outage,Mary Papenfuss,11/9/17,"San Juan and at least six other cities in Puerto Rico were plunged into darkness again Thursday morning when a major transmission line failed, authorities reported. Puerto Rico’s federal emergency command center went dark when the power cut out.The controversial Montana company Whitefish Energy Holdings had worked on the line before its $300 million contract was revoked late last month and had declared it repaired in an Oct. 26 Twitter post. Whitefish said in a statement to The Hill that the failure didn’t have “anything to do with the repairs Whitefish Energy performed.” The FBI is reportedly investigation how Whitefish, a tiny company with connections to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, won the contract.Only 43 percent of the island’s power had been restored before Thursday. With the line failure, that dropped to just 18 percent. The power line runs from Cambalache to Manatí near the north coast and services the northern half of the island, officials said.About 25 percent of the power had been restored by Thursday night, and officials hoped 42 percent would be back by Friday, Ricardo Ramos Rodriguez, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), told CNN. He didn’t know the reason for Thursday’s failure.Justo González, PREPA’s director of generation, said on a Facebook video that returning power to hospitals, airports, and fire and police stations would be a priority.The demoralizing setback occurred just days after some of the same regions of the island were beginning to get back on line more than six weeks after Hurricane Maria. The power meltdown occurred as FEMA was making arrangements to transport Puerto Ricans displaced by the hurricane to hotels in Florida and New York as much of the island remains devastated. It’s the first such plan of its kind by FEMA. Nearly 3,000 Puerto Ricans are still living in shelters, but FEMA insists few of them seem interested in leaving the island, NPR reported.About 140,000 Puerto Ricans have already left on their own for Florida, according to Florida Gov. Rick Scott.Restoration of power and running water, delivery of food to hungry citizens, construction and repair of buildings, and the reopening of schools are severely lagging. Donald Trump has said he would score a “10 out of 10” for his response to the Puerto Rican devastation. “We have provided so much, so fast,” he said in mid-October, a month after Maria hit, when 80 percent of the island had no power and 30 percent had no running water.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz slammed the federal government’s response. “We are dying here, and I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles,” she said at a news conference in late September. “Mayday! We are in trouble.”Trump responded in a tweet that she was “nasty.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-massive-power-outage_n_5a04ebc6e4b05673aa585cbf,HuffPost,Liberal
130,Puerto Rico's leaders don't know who has power. We tried to find out,"Leyla Santiago, Khushbu Shah and Rachel Clarke",11/6/17," Towns and communities across Puerto Rico are entirely without power, more than six weeks after Hurricane Maria. The island's leadership  is touting restoration figures  that show nearly 40% of electricity generation has resumed -- but it doesn't say how much of that power is actually reaching homes, schools and hospitals.  Officials from the government and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) don't even know how many people have power for lights, air conditioners, refrigerators and other basic necessities. So, while some power plants can generate power, the ability to transmit it to homes may not be possible in some areas.  One of the union leaders for PREPA employees, Evans Castro Aponte, was hearing things were so bad he estimated just 5% of customers have electricity. That would leave 95% of the 3.4 million Americans on the island without any power unless they can run costly and loud generators that have become difficult to find on the island. With no reliable government information, CNN tried to contact each of the 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico, which are coordinating their own recoveries.  Most calls simply did not go through. Along with so much here, communication is intermittent at best.  Some 42 of the municipalities could not be contacted. Of the 36 towns we did reach, 10 said they had 0% power restoration. Others estimated 1, 2, 10, perhaps 20% of homes, businesses and amenities had electricity. Just four regions reported that they were more than half back on line -- Ponce and Guayanilla with 60% of residents with power; San Germán, where 75% of buildings have electricity; and Culebra -- an island off Puerto Rico that's home to just fewer than 2,000 people, where the mayor said 90% had power. Humacao, an area where almost 54,000 live, has no power. Las Piedras, home to nearly 40,000, has no power. The same story for Loiza, where 30,000 live. And the list goes on and on, six weeks after the blackout.   Fernando Padilla, director of the project management office for PREPA, insisted to CNN they were on target with work, having exceeded the goal of 33% power generation by the end of October.  ""The amount of generation restored is not directly coordinated to amount of clients, but what I can say is that the main metropolitan cities have all or most of their critical loads on,"" he said. He agreed that focusing on generation, not customers with power, could be confusing, but said it was currently the most accurate measurement of progress. Pressed on whether PREPA knows how many people on the island have electricity, he said: ""At this moment, we wouldn't have a reliable amount."" He did not dispute that some communities would have ""very close to zero"" power, but said he remained optimistic of meeting  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's goal of 95% with power by December 15  on the way to 100% restoration. ""It's been an extreme challenge based on the devastation that Hurricane Maria brought."" The massive, long-term outages are affecting every part of life. In the capital, San Juan, many apartment blocks are still black at night apart from candles flickering in windows. Generators hum constantly, but sometimes they fail, even at fancy hotels. Restaurants and businesses remain closed. A barber in the Condado neighborhood cuts hair outside, as he has no light or power in his shop.  Even this week, CNN was unable to reach officials in this city to get their estimate on how many people have power. Out of the city, in San Germán in the southwest, the mayor said the irony was that they'd been able to reopen some schools, but that the schools did not have power.  Orlando Cintron, spokesman in the Humacao mayor's office, said the municipality was using about 15 generators for essential services.  In Juncos, east of Puerto Rico, Mayor Alfredo Carrión said he was desperate because two major companies -- Amgen, a pharmaceutical company, and Medtronic, a medical device company -- that employ 4,000 local people don't have power. Medtronic spokesman Fernando Vivanco said his company had been using generators at its five facilities on the island for several weeks as it worked to resume pre-hurricane operations. For ordinary people, the lack of power -- especially for those without a generator or the ability to run one -- is one long, relentless grind.  ""I had no idea it would last this long,"" said Luis Rivera, at home in Manati, west of San Juan. He is surviving with what looks like a light from a Christmas tree, powered by a car battery.  ""It's not easy to live like this,"" said Rivera, who also doesn't have running water at home. He and his wife have moved their bed to an open window to catch nighttime breezes. ""I can't run a fan. It's really hot."" His nephew, Ediel Rivera, 11, said their evenings were simple, and boring. ""We stare at each others' faces or play on our cell phones if they're charged."" For some, the outage is now heading towards its third month. Hurricane Irma skirted Puerto Rico on September 6 but still knocked out some power that did not come back before Hurricane Maria smashed the island on September 20.  And there just seems to be no end in sight, no light at the end of a very long tunnel.  The power grid was old and dilapidated and in desperate need of repair even before this September's hurricanes shut it down completely.  Help took time to arrive. Unlike when storms are heading for Florida or the Gulf or anywhere in the mainland United States, power crews were not able to wait just out of the path of the storm, to swoop in and start repairing downed lines as soon as possible.  And then some of the first crews that were brought in to fix things were linked to multimillion-dollar contracts that caused political and financial controversy. But earlier this week, Puerto Rico's  governor announced that the deal would be voided .   Rosselló has now called on his counterparts in New York and Florida to send power workers. And FEMA has tasked the US Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure.  By now, many people just want to have light at the flick of a switch, and a place to keep food cool, whichever teams of workers makes it happen.  And perhaps watch a movie, a video game or a soap opera on TV to take their minds off their problems for a while. This story has been updated with information from Medtronic.

64,"On The Brink Of A Health Care Crisis, Puerto Rico Asks Trump To Waive Medicaid Costs","Roberta Rampton, Robin Respaut",11/2/17,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Puerto Rico, still reeling from Hurricane Maria, is asking the Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers for help in staving off a Medicaid crisis that has put a quarter of the island’s residents at risk of losing medical care.The territory, which has grappled for years with shortfalls in funding of its Medicaid healthcare program, is on track to run out of money to pay doctors and hospitals by early next year, leaving as many as 900,000 low-income Puerto Ricans without care.Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked Washington to waive the territory’s share of Medicaid costs ― a step that could cost hundreds of millions. Last week, Rossello returned with another request: an infusion of $1.6 billion per year for at least five years.A dozen Democratic senators have raised the issue with the Trump administration. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has also expressed support, saying the Medicaid woes could hasten an exodus from the island, though he has not yet taken a position on specific proposals.“If you take the storm and you add already all the inconveniences, obstructions that it’s created ― and combine that with a Medicaid collapse ― then you’re really going to accelerate the number of people coming to the mainland,” Rubio said in an interview.Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told Reuters that the administration was working on a Medicaid proposal for the island but she gave no details.“We’re looking at everything at this point. We want to make sure that we’re supportive of them to deal with this crisis ― but also dealing with some of their baseline issues that they had with the healthcare system,” said Verma, who visited Puerto Rico last week.The timing and legislative vehicle for any funding are not yet clear. The White House is working on another emergency relief package for Puerto Rico, expected in mid-November.The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has proposed including $1 billion in stop-gap funding for Puerto Rico Medicaid as part of a bill to renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.The program cost almost $2.5 billion in 2016, and was projected to be at least $875 million short in funds in 2018. (For a graphic on the Medicaid funding “cliff”: http://tmsnrt.rs/2yT1qWG)‘WE NEED A PLAN B’As Puerto Rico is a territory and not a state, its residents do not pay federal income taxes. Washington, which shares the cost of Medicaid with states, has long capped spending to territories.The result: low-income states such as Mississippi get 75 percent of their Medicaid bill covered by Washington, while only about 12 percent of Puerto Rico’s costs are covered under the cap.Six weeks after Maria tore through Puerto Rico, the island is struggling to pick up the pieces, and about two-thirds of its residents remain without power.The territory declared bankruptcy earlier this year and the storm has plunged its economy into deeper uncertainty, exacerbating the Medicaid crisis.“I am worried about my patients. I am worried about myself. I have a family and obligations,” said Ivan Gonzalez-Cancel, a heart surgeon at Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico, who said he expects the territory to run out of Medicaid money in February.“I have been talking to many people for years saying, ‘We need a Plan B,’” Gonzalez said. “They are counting on that money.”The hurricane is one of several massive disasters to hit the United States over the past three months. Congress has approved more than $51 billion in emergency aid since September and will consider another aid request this month.Carlos Mercader, a spokesman for the governor, said he hoped federal attention to Puerto Rico’s hurricane woes would lead to a longer-lasting fix for its Medicaid problems.But Joe Antos, a healthcare economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that might be a tough sell in Washington, given the island’s long list of needs.“They have had no traction on this issue, whatsoever, for decades,” Antos said. “This is just a very bitter frosting on a really tough cake.”(Reporting by Roberta Rampton in Washington; additional reporting by Robin Respaut in San Francisco and Richard Cowan in Washington; graphic by Han Huang; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Andrew Hay)",[],HuffPost,Liberal
132,UN experts blast US disaster response in Puerto Rico,Ray Sanchez,10/31/17," Some 3.4 million Americans are facing ""alarming"" conditions more than a month after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, UN human experts said, calling the disaster response there ineffective compared with the urgency of federal aid to storm-ravaged states on the US mainland. A panel of 11 experts said Monday that the hurricane aggravated an already dire situation brought on by debt and austerity. Few hospitals are functioning, some residents are left to consume contaminated water, and thousands are displaced ""without any relief in sight,""  the experts said in a statement .  As of Tuesday, only about 30% of Puerto Rico's power was back online,  according to the US commonwealth's government.   ""We can't fail to note the dissimilar urgency and priority given to the emergency response in Puerto Rico, compared to the US states affected by hurricanes in recent months,"" said Leilani Farha, the UN special rapporteur on housing.  The criticism of the US response comes amid a preliminary FBI inquiry into a $300 million contract between the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and Whitefish Energy Holdings,  according to a source with knowledge of the inquiry. The energy firm was contracted to rebuild the electrical grid destroyed by Hurricanes Maria and Irma last month.  Members of Congress have raised concerns over the manner in which the contract was awarded to the small Montana company. The Federal Emergency Management Agency also has questioned the amount of the contract. The company has ties to the Trump administration. It's based in Whitefish, Montana, the small hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and the CEO is an acquaintance of  Zinke's. An investment firm that owns a major stake in the company is run by a donor to Trump's presidential campaign. The company, Zinke, the White House and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority   have denied any wrongdoing. The Puerto Rican utility is working to cancel the controversial contract.  Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, a UN expert on foreign debt and human rights, said access to health, food, education, housing, water and social security on the island had been ""massively undermined"" by the economic and financial crisis that predated the disaster. Nearly half the population was living below the poverty line before Hurricane Maria struck on September 20, according to the UN experts.  ""With winter approaching, we call for a speedy and well-resourced emergency response that prioritizes the most vulnerable and at risk -- children, older people, people with disabilities, women and homeless people,"" the UN experts said in their statement.  With about 90,000 homes destroyed and the island's most valuable exports -- banana and coffee -- hit hard, residents were ""at their most vulnerable"" and facing immediate food shortages, the experts said.

131,Puerto Rico is killing its $300 million Whitefish contract. Now what?,Donna Borak,10/31/17,"Now that Puerto Rico's governor has called for the cancellation of a controversial $300 million contract awarded to a small Montana-based utility, many questions remain for the millions of residents who continue to live on the island without electricity.  Governor Ricardo Rossello's request to terminate the contract with Whitefish Energy comes   less than two weeks   after the two-year-old firm announced it had landed the deal to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical   grid.    
 
  On Sunday, Rossello called on Ricardo Ramos, the head of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority -- known as PREPA -- to void the deal immediately in the wake of escalating public outrage and a growing litany of government reviews.   ""There can be no distraction that alters the commitment to repair the power grid as quickly as possible,"" Rossello said in a statement.   The Whitefish contract is the largest to be awarded since recovery efforts began over a month ago. Several lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for reviews of how Whitefish, a small firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit, was chosen over bigger, more established utilities by PREPA. On Monday,  it was reported  that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened a preliminary review of the contract, according to a source familiar with the matter.     A number of concerns have also been raised, including whether there was any political influence that resulted in Whitefish winning the deal and if PREPA took the appropriate steps in awarding the deal.   PREPA's Ramos said the state-run utility would work toward canceling the contract and would appoint a trustee to oversee the hiring of any new contractors.   Whitefish has expressed disappointment over the latest step. ""The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve,"" the company said in a statement.   Still,   about 70% of the island is living without power and now there is even more uncertainty about when all the lights will go back on.   Here are some of the questions that remain:    1. Did PREPA do anything wrong by awarding the contract to Whitefish?    The jury is still out.   There are several ongoing reviews looking into how PREPA went about choosing the utility company over other potential candidates. So far, no wrongdoing has been discovered.   Government agencies usually will make a public request for help on a particular job. Often, they will receive multiple offers and the agency reviews and   accepts the best, lowest cost bid.    But Puerto Rico's governor told CNN last week that PREPA triggered an ""emergency protocol"" to start rebuilding its electrical grid on the island immediately after the hurricane hit. The governor did not elaborate on what that protocol entailed.      Both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the  Federal Emergency Management Agency have said  they did not sign off on the Whitefish contract, according to spokespersons for both agencies.   On Tuesday, FEMA administrator Brock Long told members of a Senate panel the agency would never have signed off on the deal.   After the controversy surrounding the contract emerged, the governor instructed Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget   to conduct an audit of the Whitefish deal.   The governor's office said it has since   escalated   the review by requesting a ""detailed and in-depth investigation"" of PREPA's emergency procurement process by Puerto Rico's comptroller.   Results of the audit were expected   last Friday, but have yet to be released.   Without learning the full details of the audit,   Rossello called upon PREPA to cancel the Whitefish deal over the weekend. The governor's office has made it clear the request   in no way demonstrates any wrongdoing thus far.    2. Has Whitefish already stopped work on the island?    No, not yet. The embattled utility company is still pressing ahead with its   work.   Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames told CNN the firm's work won't stop immediately per the terms of its contract with PREPA.   PREPA's Ramos said earlier this week the contract requires 30 days notice before cancellation, and that the state-owned utility wanted Whitefish to ""finish what they started.""    So far, Whitefish said it has completed   ""significant work"" on two major transmissions lines that crossed over mountains and it has done some critical work in some remote parts of Puerto Rico that were only accessible by helicopter and heavy equipment.       Its efforts, the company said, have helped restore power to hospitals, businesses and residents of Manati and soon enough 500,000 people in the city of San Juan.   Whitefish said it   plans to continue fixing transmission lines into San Juan. It also plans to bring an additional 150 lineman to the island this week -- bringing the total to 500 workers.   ""The original decision by PREPA to have Whitefish Energy come to the Puerto Rico only sped up the repairs, and if it were not for that action, crews would just now be getting to the island to begin the process of rebuilding the system and restoring power,"" according to a Whitefish statement Sunday.    3. What happens after Whitefish is gone?     With Whitefish on its way out, Puerto Rico's   governor said he has turned to governors in New York and Florida for help in the recovery effort as part of the mutual aid network among public utilities.   On Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo posted on Twitter the state would deploy ""additional utility crews and equipment to restore power in Puerto Rico.""      New York is deploying additional utility crews and equipment to help restore power in Puerto Rico. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo)  October 29, 2017        ""There was no reason for this to take 36 days,"" Cuomo told CNN's Fredericka Whitfield on Sunday. ""it's just frankly, because they didn't get the attention and I think we treat Puerto Ricans like second-class Americans.""   Florida Governor Rick Scott on Monday said he would lead a delegation of Florida utility providers to Puerto Rico later this week.    4. What other steps can Puerto RIco take to get the power up and running?    On Tuesday, PREPA formally requested to tap the mutual aid network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.   PREPA's Ramos sent a letter to the American Public Power Association and the Edison Electric Institute requesting    additional resources for the island.   The state-run utility could have requested aid through this network right after the hurricane hit. But Ramos said he didn't because the closest states to Puerto Rico were already dealing with their own rebuilding efforts after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. He said he believed they would not be able to respond quickly to the island's needs.   The bankrupt utility, which is struggling with nearly $9 billion in debt, also couldn't afford to cover the costs of utilizing the network either, he said.   Carlos Mercader, director of Puerto Rico Governor's office in Washington, told CNN utilizing the network would be a ""different situation"" than before since the governor himself is asking for help.   One option would be for PREPA   to rehire Whitefish subcontractors so they may continue doing the work to restore power and meet the governor's goal to restore nearly a 100% of power by the end of the year.    Mercader said the priority now is to transition away from Whitefish, while obtaining more resources to help with restoring power on the island.   Rossello set a goal of having over 1,000 brigades in Puerto Rico by Nov. 8. So far, only 404 crews have arrived. Of those, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has only sent seven, according to Rossello.   Rossello said his announcement on Sunday was intended to reaffirm Puerto Rico's ""commitment to transparency in the contracting process... and to achieve the highest degree of efficiency possible in the restoration of the power grid of our island, in the shortest amount of time possible.""    --CNN's Rene Marsh and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.

65,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority Cancels Whitefish Energy Deal,Hayley Miller,10/29/17,"WASHINGTON ― Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is canceling its controversial $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings to restore the island’s hurricane-ravaged electrical grid, officials announced Sunday.Ricardo Ramos, executive director of PREPA, said at a press conference he would honor Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s Sunday morning request to terminate the business deal, which has raised questions from several lawmakers and government agencies.“I want to clarify, so it’s very clear, that the cancellation of this contract does not respond to an acceptance that there was something outside of the law or out of line with [PREPA’s] procedures of emergency contracts,” Ramos said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday that it had“significant concerns” over PREPA’s decision to award Whitefish the contract earlier this month and would be conducting a review.Whitefish, a two-year-old firm based in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s Montana hometown and financially backed in part by a major donor to PresidentDonald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, had just two full-time employees when Hurricane Maria hit the island more than a month ago. Language in the contract ― a full copy is here ― appeared to give Whitefish a sweetheart deal as the people of Puerto Rico struggle to recover from the devastation of the hurricane.The contract stated that, “In no event shall [government bodies] have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements.” That gave Whitefish wide discretion and privacy over how it used $300 million in U.S. taxpayer money.It also waived “any claim against Contractor related to delayed completion of the work,” which means the government couldn’t do much if Whitefish dragged out its job restoring electricity to the 3.4 million Americans living on the island.Ramos said Sunday that $300 million was the maximum amount of money Whitefish could have been paid for its completed services and denied that PREPA had already committed to paying the full amount.So far, PREPA has paid or been billed for over $20 million by Whitefish, according to Ramos. He said there wouldn’t be a penalty for canceling the contract, but that PREPA would have to pay for Whitefish to remove their equipment from the island as well as whatever work they complete by mid-November, which he expected to total at least an additional $10.9 million.The contract’s cancellation, which won’t go into effect for 30 days per the contract’s terms, isn’t expected to stop any work the company currently has in progress. But it could delay other grid restoration efforts by 10 to 12 weeks, Ramos said.“The controversy that the contract has generated is truly immense,” said Ramos, adding that he had been summoned by Congress to answer questions. “It’s a huge distraction. So as I understand it, it’s the better of two evils to cancel the contract.”Whitefish said it would finish any work that PREPA asks them to complete before leaving the U.S. territory, according to a statement the company emailed to HuffPost on Sunday.“We are very disappointed in the decision by Governor Rosselló to ask PREPA to cancel the contract which led to PREPA’s announcement this afternoon,” reads the statement. “We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico. We are very proud of our contributions to the island’s recovery and proud of the tremendous work that our team has done under very challenging conditions.It’s been more than a month since the hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and nearly 70 percent of people still have no power ― a particularly precarious situation for hospitals that have been relying on temporary generators to keep people alive.HuffPost reached out to experts in government contracting to see if this was as bad a deal for Puerto Rico as it sounded. The answer was a resounding yes.“Outrageous,” said Charles Tiefer, a professor of government contracting at the University of Baltimore law school.“The clause that shields the contractor from audit or review is a red flag of overcharging,” said Tiefer. “The contractor works for PREPA, not the other way around. I can’t imagine how any responsible government official could put such an anti-audit clause into a government contract.”Anthony Varona, a professor and vice dean at American University’s Washington College of Law and an expert in contracts law, said it was “entirely inappropriate” for a private contractor to prevent the government from auditing how taxpayer money was spent.“The prohibition as written in this agreement is a blatant attempt to blindfold and tie the hands of the government officials responsible for overseeing the contract’s performance,” said Varona. “It strikes me as an open invitation for fraud and abuse.”There were other concerning details in the contract, like the high rates Whitefish was charging for labor. The company was paying $240 an hour for a general foreman and $227 for a lineman. For some context, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said first-line supervisors of construction sites make about $43 an hour and construction laborers make about $23 an hour.Whitefish was also paying for expensive food and lodging for its employees. The contract stated that each person could spend nearly $80 a day for meals and $332 a day for lodging. Flights for employees were being billed at $1,000 each way.Neither PREPA nor Whitefish responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment on the contents of the contract.Ramos emphasized that it was “tabloid” reports ― not any wrongdoing on the part of the company ― that prompted Rosselló’s request to cancel the contract on Sunday.“Certainly, if the situation that is going on in the U.S. with the media was not happening ... there [would be] no need for the cancellation of the contract,” Ramos said. “We’re managing risks. There is a perception risk, a reputational risk, and a delay risk in continuing with the contract.”Steve Schooner, a former high-ranking government contracting official who is now a law professor at George Washington University, said the Whitefish contract has given him great material for his classes because there are so many problems with it.“The contract ― both the process and the content ― rivals, and in some ways exceeds, some of the best final exams I’ve written for my students over the last two decades,” he said.Not everyone said the contract was stunningly out of the ordinary. Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project On Government Oversight, wrote a blog post about why he thinks the contract raised concerns but was mostly normal, given bigger problems surrounding many federal contracts.Still, Amey told HuffPost that it’s “odd” that the contract gave Whitefish the ability to delay its work without any accountability. He said that clause allowed the company to potentially prolong its work so it got paid the entire $300 million ― and then push to extend the contract for even more money.“Damage provisions often are included to incentivize the work’s completion,” he said. “Waiving claims could jeopardize the completion of the work in the agreed on one-year term.”As fishy as it has looked that a tiny company in the Montana hometown of the U.S. interior secretary landed such a big contract, Zinke has insisted he had nothing to do with it.Tiefer said while all the facts aren’t out yet, it’s clear that something “went very wrong” with the way the contract was awarded.“Let’s put it this way,” he said. “Whitefish didn’t make the shortlist because of a world-class reputation.”Carolina Moreno contributed reporting.This entry has been updated with information about PREPA’s decision to cancel the Whitefish contract.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-power-whitefish-contract-zinke_n_59f60718e4b03cd20b823156,HuffPost,Liberal
134,Puerto Rico residents fleeing to Florida after Hurricane Maria,Faith Karimi,10/27/17," Tens of thousands of Puerto Rico residents are fleeing to Florida after Hurricane Maria, leaving behind an island that is still struggling to regain power more than  one month after the storm .  About 70% of the US territory, which is home to approximately 3.4 million US citizens, is still without power. Many do not have access to  reliable drinking water.  ""Since October 3, 2017, more than 73,000 individuals arrived in Florida from Puerto Rico through Miami International Airport, Orlando International Airport and the Everglades Port,"" Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office said in a statement. The United States approved Florida to host residents with the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on October 5, he said. ""This agreement approves 100% federal reimbursement for costs incurred by the state of Florida related to the accommodation of those displaced by Hurricane Maria,"" he said.  The state has opened three disaster relief centers at the main airports in Orlando, Miami, and the Port of Miami for displaced families from Puerto Rico.  Staff from several agencies, including FEMA and the American Red Cross, are in Florida helping incoming residents, he said.  Those heading to the US mainland are leaving behind an island that's almost in total darkness. Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands  are in the midst of the largest blackout in US history,  according to a report from an economic research company. In all, Hurricane Maria has caused a loss of 1.25 billion hours of electricity supply for Americans, according to the analysis from the  Rhodium Group . That makes it the largest blackout in US history, well ahead of Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the group said. That 1.25 billion number will continue to grow. More than a month after Hurricane Maria knocked out the electric grid on the islands, the vast majority of residents remain without electricity, and the  restoration of that power is months away . As of Thursday, just 26% of households had power restored, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.  The state-owned utility  filed for bankruptcy in July , is  $9 billion in debt  and is struggling to recover from the hurricane outages. Not coincidentally, several of the top 10 blackouts in US history involve Puerto Rico, including Maria and Irma this year and Hurricane Georges in 1998. Whitefish Energy, a two-year-old utility firm with ties to the Trump administration, was awarded a $300 million contract to help restore the country's power grid. The huge contract to a small company has drawn  questions and criticism .

66,FEMA: We Have 'Significant Concerns' Over Whitefish Contract In Puerto Rico,Hayley Miller,10/27/17,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday became the latest party to question Puerto Rico Power Authority’s decision to award Whitefish Energy a $300 million contract to restore the island’s hurricane-ravaged electrical grid.“Based on initial review and information from PREPA, FEMA has significant concerns with how PREPA procured this contract and has not confirmed whether the contract prices are reasonable,” according to a FEMA statement issued Friday.Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based energy firm that is based in the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and financially backed in part by a major donor to President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was hired by Puerto Rico’s government-owned power company earlier this month.Its contract bars several government bodies from auditing or reviewing the “cost and profit elements” of Whitefish’s labor rates, according to documents first obtained Monday by several media outlets, including Caribbean Business and The Washington Post.Workers hired by Whitefish are allocated nearly $80 per day for food expenses and over $330 per day for accommodations, the documents showed.FEMA, which denied having any involvement in PREPA’s decision to award Whitefish the contract, said it was looking into the power company’s process for determining whether the contract prices were reasonable.“Any language in any contract between PREPA and Whitefish that states FEMA approved that contract is inaccurate,” according to FEMA’s statement.FEMA’s statement Friday follows Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello’s request to the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday to conduct a review of the business deal.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also denied any federal involvement in PREPA’s selection of Whitefish.“This is a contract that was determined by local authorities in Puerto Rico,” Sanders said during a press briefing Friday. “As we understand there’s an ongoing audit, and we’ll look forward to seeing the results of that.”Late Friday afternoon, Zinke denied any involvement in the contract allocation. He said in a statement that he was contacted by Whitefish after the contract was awarded, and that he welcomed “any and all investigations” into the matter. “I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico,” Zinke said. “Neither myself nor anyone in my office had advocated for this company in any way. After the initial contract was awarded, I was contacted by the company, on which I took no action. All records, which are being made available to appropriate officials, will prove no involvement.”Ken Luce, a spokesman for Whitefish, defended his company’s contract with PREPA on Wednesday and accused some critics of having “a fundamental lack of understanding about the industry.”“There’s no conspiracy,” Luce told HuffPost. “Whitefish is no different than any other company that would be out there doing the work.”Luce did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment Friday about FEMA’s statement.Several political figures, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, have cast doubts about the ethical fitness of such a business deal, claiming the processes involved in procuring the contract lacked transparency.“The contract should be voided right away, and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place,” Cruz told Yahoo News earlier this week.“Every contract that comes out needs to be a public document,” she continued. “This is one of the things that we are asking for, and the due diligence that goes towards that contract also needs to be public documents.”This story has been updated to include comments from Sanders and Zinke as well as to note that Caribbean Business and other news organizations obtained a copy of the contract Monday.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
133,Puerto Rico sees an opportunity to reimagine the island,Patrick Gillespie,10/27/17,"Puerto Rico had archaic roads, bridges and electricity for years -- long before Hurricane Maria.  Then the storm devastated the island's transportation and communication networks. President Trump says ""broken infrastructure"" was to blame for any delayed response by the federal government. Seven in 10 Puerto Ricans still have no power.    
 
  Despite the suffering, one of Puerto Rico's leaders sees the hurricane's destruction as a chance for a clean slate.    ""We have this historic opportunity: Instead of going with incremental changes, we can go and push the envelope to really transform the infrastructure,"" Economic Secretary Manuel Laboy told CNNMoney on Thursday in New York. ""That is the silver lining opportunity that we have.""    The first sign of that type of sweeping rebuild came Wednesday, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that a children's hospital in San Juan, the capital, is being powered by Tesla solar panels and power packs.   Musk  wrote in an Instagram post  that the project is the ""first of many solar + battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.""   Laboy, the economic secretary, said Tesla has ""five to 10"" projects in the works in Puerto Rico, including schools and community centers.  Tesla   ( TSLA )  declined to provide specifics.    AT&T   ( T )  and a project owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, teamed up to provide cell phone coverage to parts of the island cut off from communication. Project Loon won approval from the U.S. government to fly up to 30 giant balloons over Puerto Rico, beaming down LTE service. (AT&T is buying Time Warner   ( TWX ) , the parent company of CNN.)   Puerto Rico is even pitching itself as  a site for Amazon's second headquarters . Laboy declined to provide specifics but said he sent  Amazon   ( AMZN )  a lucrative package of incentives to consider.    He sees the island's recovery as a selling point with Amazon, in addition to Puerto Rico's educated and bilingual workforce.   ""The opportunity to transform the infrastructure ... for me, that is a very powerful message,"" Laboy said.   Of course, Puerto Rico has to get the lights back on before it can carry out big plans. And that hasn't been easy, nor without controversy.   The utility company, PREPA,  found itself under fire  after it gave a $300 million contract to an infrastructure repair company, Whitefish Energy. The company only has two official employees, though it's hired hundreds of subcontractors to help restore the power grid.   Investigations are under way into the the contract's procurement. Critics say the contract is bloated and didn't go through proper bidding.   Beyond the physical damage, Puerto Rico must overcome vast other challenges to rebuild an innovative infrastructure system.   Unemployment is high, and some the island's young, educated class has been leaving for the mainland United States for years. Some fear the hurricane's destruction  could expedite the exodus . The island's government also filed for bankruptcy last spring.   But Laboy says those challenges shouldn't prevent Puerto Rico from thinking big.   ""We need to be bold and we need to transform the system,"" he added. ""That is going to be the key for the recovery, and the sustainable economic growth that we are aspiring to have in Puerto Rico.""

68,Rebuilding Puerto Rico,"Julia Meszaros, Contributor",10/26/17,"The devastation following Hurricane Maria is still impacting a large portion of the Puerto Rican population and relief efforts have been stagnant. The current presidential administration has made a clear distinction between victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida and the victims of Hurricane Maria. The government’s lack of response to Puerto Rico’s situation can be traced to the island’s colonial relationship with the United States. Many Americans do not know that Puerto Ricans are in fact American citizens, let alone realize that Puerto Rico has no real representation within the government. This colonial relationship has always placed Puerto Rico on the peripheries of the American nation, which has been highlighted with the response to Hurricane Maria.Currently, many residents of the island are without power, and most people are expecting that they won’t have electricity until next year. The government claims that power will be returned to most of the Island by December, but many residents are skeptical. That skepticism has translated into a major outward migration of the population to the U.S. Outmigration to the U.S. has become a major issue on the island, as nearly 67,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to Florida in the past month. The few efforts the government has implemented to help Puerto Rico recover have been focused on relief, such as providing bottles of water and other supplies needed. However, local organizations on the ground are moving beyond relief to address rebuilding Puerto Rico’s infrastructure in order to prevent another catastrophic situation from occurring with the next hurricane. One of the main organizations leading the shift towards rebuilding is Mentes Puertorriqueñas en Acción (MPA), a group focused on training young people to be agents of change that intertwine their projects with the growth of Puerto Rico. I spoke with the Director, Alejandro Silva Díaz, about the needs on the ground to help Puerto Rico recover and rebuild. He began by telling me that the organization focuses on three types of jobs. The first job is cleaning up and removing debris from the storm. The second job is taking a community census of each community’s needs with Connect Relief, a local mobile phone application leading the data collection initiative in the island. Finally, the third job the organization is focused on is gathering names of people who are still missing, entering this data on the Maria Tech Brigade platform created by an entity called Startups of PR. While relief efforts, such as food and supplies distribution, are still important, many other organizations working on that end, and Silva tries to avoid that overlap. MPA is really focusing on engaging citizens, bridging information and rebuilding a sustainable infrastructure for Puerto Rico. For instance, instead of providing communities with bottled water, the organization is planning to bring in engineers to teach communities to build their own water filters and phone chargers. The organization makes a strong effort to challenge the savior complex by tapping local community organizations and leaders to help with rebuilding efforts. By working directly with community members, MPA hopes to create community empowerment through participation in rebuilding efforts, as local communities know what they need best and they will become more resilient through participating. Silva argues that it is important to include local communities in the rebuilding efforts, and MPA is open to working with any organizations looking to help. They are members of Social Innovation and Collaboration Community (CCIS in spanish) community, one of the most important disaster relief effort hubs in Puerto Rico, which has allowed them to collaborate with other community based entities such as Taller Salud, Centro Nueva Mujer in Cayey, Proyecto Enlace del Caño Martín Peña, Caras con Causa, Fundación Comunitaria de PR, Vitrina Solidaria, and the Instituto Nueva Escuela. Ultimately, MPA’s partnership with Connect Relief, helps centralize information about where organizations are going in order to prevent overlap and under serving certain communities, such as many communities in the center of the Island. This is where other movements, such as “Por Los Nuestros” have become vital to share information. The rebuilding efforts are so important to ending situations of dependency in preparation for future natural disasters.

135,"Puerto Rico's power outages are the largest in US history, report says",Eric Levenson,10/26/17," In terms of the total number of lost hours of electricity, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are in the midst of the largest blackout in US history, according to a report from an economic research company. In all, Hurricane Maria has caused a loss of 1.25 billion hours of electricity supply for Americans, according to the analysis from the  economic research firm Rhodium Group . That makes it the largest blackout in US history, well ahead of Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the group said. That 1.25 billion number will continue to grow. More than a month after Hurricane Maria knocked out the electric grid on the islands, the vast majority of residents remain without electricity, and the  restoration of that power is months away . The Rhodium Group analysis largely relies on data on electricity loss provided to the Department of Energy, as well as news reports for storms prior to 2000, according to Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium who co-wrote the analysis with Peter Marsters. Houser said the group analyzes the economic impacts of weather and climate events, and they decided to dig in more deeply on the impacts of Maria on the Puerto Rican economy. ""As we started looking at the scale of the blackout and try to put that in historical context, it became clear this was a record-breaking event and worthy of some attention and focus just from an electric standpoint,"" Houser said. 9 of top 10 are hurricane-related Other major storms or incidents have knocked out power for more people, but those were for shorter periods of time.  For example, the 2003 blackouts in the Northeast US affected about 30 million people, but the  power was restored within a few days . That incident caused the loss of 592 million customer-hours of electricity, according to Rhodium Group, making it the eighth-largest blackout in US history. Puerto Rico has a smaller population -- about 3.4 million -- but the blackout has lasted for a much longer stretch of time. As of Thursday, just 26% of households had power restored, according to data from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). PREPA, a state-owned utility,  filed for bankruptcy in July , is  $9 billion in debt  and is struggling to recover from the hurricane outages. Not coincidentally, several of the top 10 blackouts in US history involve Puerto Rico, including Maria and Irma this year and Hurricane Georges in 1998. Whitefish Energy, a two-year-old utility firm with ties to the Trump administration, was awarded a $300 million contract from PREPA last week to help restore the country's power grid. The huge contract to a small company has led to  questions and criticism from Puerto Rican politicians . The Virgin Islands, with a much smaller population, has similarly struggled to restore power since Hurricane Maria. As of October 22, just 14.9% of customers had power, according to the  U.S. Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority.  That includes about 71% without power on St. Thomas, 98.4% without power on St. Croix and 100% without power on St. John. Aside from the 2003 blackout, all of the biggest blackouts in US history were due to hurricanes or major storms, including Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This year's hurricane season has been particularly destructive. Hurricane Irma, the Category 5 storm that tore through the Caribbean before hitting Florida in early September, caused the loss of 753 million hours of electricity, making it the fourth-largest blackout in US history. In general, most power outages are due to disruption in the power lines that deliver energy, rather than in energy generation, Houser said. Hurricanes, with their high sustained winds and wide geographic area, are particularly likely to knock out power for large numbers of people.

67,"As Puerto Rico Struggles In Darkness, Tesla Brings Light To Children’s Hospital In San Juan",Dominique Mosbergen,10/26/17,"As millions of Puerto Ricans struggle without power, automaker and energy company Tesla is bringing some much-needed light to the hurricane-ravaged island.Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, announced on Wednesday that the company had restored electricity to San Juan’s Hospital del Niño (Children’s Hospital) after installing solar panels and energy storage batteries at the facility.In a viral Instagram post, Musk said the solar firm’s installation at the hospital marked the “first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.” “Glad to help support the recovery,” added Musk, who has personally donated $250,000 to support the island’s hurricane relief efforts.According to David Begnaud, a CBS News correspondent, the hospital’s solar farm is capable of generating 200 kilowatts of solar power and has 500 kilowatts of storage. That’ll be sufficient to support the day-to-day operations of the facility, which has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions and provides care to more than 3,000 children from across the island.The solar farm is reportedly a donation from Tesla to the hospital and will be provided free of charge for an indefinite time as Puerto Rico gets back on its feet following the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which barreled through the island last month.Maria Lopez, the hospital’s executive director, told the newspaper El Nuevo Dia that once the energy crisis is over, the facility would likely negotiate a deal with Tesla to acquire the system permanently. She added that the solar installation had “enormous implications on the operation of the institution,” which had been struggling to serve its patients since the hurricane hit. Tesla has made quick work of its promise to help Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria ― a promise that was apparently sparked by a series of tweets between Musk and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello.Musk had mused on Twitter on Oct. 5 that Tesla could likely help restore power to parts of Puerto Rico using solar panels and batteries.Rossello promptly responded to Musk’s comments: “Let’s talk,” the governor tweeted. Musk replied that he’d be “happy” to chat and hoped “Tesla can be helpful.”Less than three weeks later, Rossello attended the unveiling of Tesla’s solar farm at San Juan’s Children’s Hospital.The governor thanked Tesla for what he called a “humanitarian gesture,” and said the project “could be a model to follow for public or private entities that offer services critical to citizens,” according to El Nuevo Dia.Seventy-five percent of Puerto Rico’s power grid is still down. Rebuilding it will likely take months, experts estimate, and could cost as much as $5 billion, according to NPR. Millions are currently relying on generators for power. But with the price of generators skyrocketing, they’re “out of reach” for many average Puerto Ricans, reported Vox.The stories coming out of the U.S. territory are harrowing: Children returning to schools without electricity and doctors performing surgery under the light of cellphones.The former governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Padilla, tweeted this image last week: The source of the photo is unknown and could not be independently verified. A tiny Montana energy company named Whitefish was recently awarded a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico’s power grid, prompting questions as to how such a small firm could secure such a major project. The company has ties to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and backing from a major donor to President Donald Trump. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz called the contract “alarming.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tesla-puerto-rico-childrens-hospital_n_59f18034e4b0af27f5899818,HuffPost,Liberal
136,Water-borne infections push Puerto Rico death toll higher,Eric Levenson and Tristan Smith,10/25/17," More than a month since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the death toll from the storm has risen to 51, according to Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety The latest two victims died from leptospirosis, an infection that can spread after floods through contaminated water, Public Safety press officer Karixia Ortiz told CNN. The cause of death is also included in the latest list of certified deaths just released by Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety. Puerto Rico has announced at least  76 cases of suspected and confirmed leptospirosis , including several deaths, in the month after Hurricane Maria, according to Dr. Carmen Deseda, the state epidemiologist for Puerto Rico. The spiral-shaped Leptospira bacteria, which are found in the urine of rodents and other animals, can spread after floods through drinking water or infection of open wounds, according to the World Health Organization. Leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics, and many people recover on their own. But a  small number may develop dire complications  such as meningitis or kidney or liver failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lack of clean drinking water Since the hurricane hit in September, many in Puerto Rico have not had access to clean drinking water or electricity. As of Wednesday, a quarter of households did not have access to clean drinking water, according to  data from Puerto Rico's Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados  (AAA). The Federal Emergency Management Agency has attempted to cover that shortage with bottled water deliveries, but some desperate residents have been drinking from whatever water sources they can find, such as rivers or creeks. Doctors and public health experts are worried that that the water crisis would lead to further health problems. ""There is a public health crisis here,"" Catherine Kennedy, a vice president at National Nurses United,  told CNN  from Puerto Rico. ""They need water. And we haven't seen much of FEMA."" In early October,  President Donald Trump told Puerto Rican officials  they should be ""very proud"" that the death toll wasn't as high as in ""a real catastrophe like Katrina,"" referring to the 2005 hurricane that destroyed New Orleans. ""Every death is a horror,"" Trump said, ""but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous -- hundreds and hundreds of people that died -- and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering ... no one has ever seen anything like this."" CNN's Michael Nedelman and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/25/health/puerto-rico-death-toll/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjTsfud2cj6AhUBRjABHYd6Ajo4PBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0RD504BBJJCNwsY977R3Ym,CNN,Liberal
137,Suspected leptospirosis cases increasing in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria,Michael Nedelman,10/24/17," Puerto Rico has reported at least 76 cases of suspected and confirmed leptospirosis, including a handful of deaths, in the month after Hurricane Maria, said Dr. Carmen Deseda, the state epidemiologist for Puerto Rico. Two deaths involved leptospirosis confirmed through laboratory testing, and ""several other"" deaths are pending test results, Deseda said. The 76 cases,  up from 74 last week , also include one patient with confirmed leptospirosis who is currently hospitalized. Spiral-shaped Leptospira bacteria, which are found in the urine of rodents and other animals, tend to spread after floods through drinking water or infection of open wounds, according to the  World Health Organization.  In serious cases, infection causes organ failure and can be fatal. ""This bacteria, like any other bacteria, can kill you,"" Deseda said. The island typically sees between 63 and 95 cases per year, she said. Health officials had expected that there would be a jump after the hurricane. ""It's neither an epidemic nor a confirmed outbreak,"" Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario Cortes said at a news conference Sunday. ""But obviously, we are making all the announcements as though it were a health emergency."" Leptospirosis may be  treated with antibiotics , but many people recover on their own. ""The majority of the lepto cases is a mild, subclinical disease with no complications,"" Deseda said. ""But one out of 10 people who have leptospirosis develop severe illness."" In the first stage of leptospirosis, symptoms vary widely from  fever and headache to red eyes and rashes.  Some people may have no symptoms at all. But a small number will develop dire complications: meningitis, kidney and liver damage, bleeding in the lungs and even death. Doctors are  required to report  any potential leptospirosis cases to health authorities, Deseda said. Those cases must then be tested to confirm the bacteria, since the symptoms can be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses. After that, health officials may look for patterns or clusters and determine whether there is an outbreak. The lab tests on the suspected cases have been sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Deseda said. The turnaround time is about five or six days. Doctors on the island have expressed concerns about  burgeoning health crises  amid hospitals that are overwhelmed, undersupplied and sometimes burning hot. Influenza is another concern on the horizon, Deseda said.  Drinking water  is also hard to come by on many parts of the island. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on  Facebook  and  Twitter . Dr. Raul Hernandez, an internist in San Juan,  told CNN  that people were drinking water from whatever sources they could find, such as rivers and creeks. If that water contains urine from an infected rat, those people will be at risk, he said.  Deseda said people should be discouraged from walking barefoot, drinking or swimming in potentially contaminated waters. ""These diseases are everywhere, and there's a way to prevent them,"" she said.

139,Relief groups hit major hurdles getting aid to Puerto Rico,Lydia DePillis,10/23/17,"Chicago is a long way away from Utuado and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. But Julian Seda is trying to get 68,000 pounds of donated supplies to these and other remote towns, as fast as he can -- and with as little official involvement as possible.  ""The government has their hands full,"" said Seda, who leads the Chicago chapter of a group called  Puerto Rico Rising  that formed after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.    
 
  Instead of raising money for the Red Cross or requesting help from the National Guard, the group found a private shipping company with operations in Chicago and Puerto Rico willing to ferry donations by boat for free to warehouses it owns on the island.   The organization, which is currently in the process of obtaining non-profit status, then distributes the supplies. That way, it avoids the government inspections at the port and ""all the bureaucracy that has become a bottleneck,"" Seda said.   Nevertheless, the ad hoc group's capacity to bring relief is limited; it has stopped collecting donations until it finds a way to transport the next load.    Seda's group is one of dozens of organizations that are running into enormous logistical hurdles while trying to help Puerto Rico.   Disaster management experts say that the citizen response has been extraordinary, as Puerto Rico's diaspora of nearly 5.4 million watch in frustration while relief workers struggle to move supplies like food, water and medicine to those in need throughout the island.    Transporting goods from church basements and high school auditoriums to an island more than 1,000 miles off the U.S. coastline, with already crumbling infrastructure and little to no cell service, has proven to be a major challenge.   Puerto Rican leaders say they haven't gotten enough help from the federal and state governments, which have assets like planes and personnel that could be used to deliver aid. Transportation companies have made in-kind donations and big names like Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda have funded charter flights. But the need is far from satisfied.       Meanwhile, volunteers say, the slow speed of road clearing and power restoration have made it more difficult to reach remote communities. There are currently 13,600 active duty and National Guard troops on the island, but many say that's not enough.   ""It shouldn't be up to the handful of Puerto Rican millionaires in this country to be the U.S. Air Force and FEMA,"" said Ohio state Rep. Dan Ramos, who represents the heavily Puerto Rican town of Lorain.   Organizers of the New York Puerto Rican Day Parade received semi trucks full of food, water and clothing from other parade organizations in places like Hartford and Cleveland. But they sat in warehouses, until leaders could arrange transportation.   ""It has been a yeoman's task to figure this out,"" said Lorraine Cortes Vasquez, who chairs the New York parade's board of directors. Finally, she said, the National Guard took their first shipment, and JetBlue  took some of their supplies as well .   Experts typically recommend that people who want to help during disasters send money, which can then be used to buy and transport supplies from points closer to people who need them. But once goods have been collected, nobody wants to waste them.   Miami nightlife impresario Michael Capponi runs the  Global Empowerment Mission , which started after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. After Maria, the group coordinated some 50 flights chartered by celebrities like Will Smith and reality TV personality Bethenny Frankel. They've procured a 100,000 square foot warehouse to store and sort 15 million pounds of donations, some of which had to be retrieved from small-scale drives all over the country.    Capponi acknowledged that it would be ""100 percent more efficient"" to raise money than collect physical goods. Later on, money can also be used to buy goods in the disaster zone, which puts money back into the local economy.   ""The problem is,"" Capponi said, ""we can't let all that stuff sit in the U.S."" So, he continues to send trucks to pick it up.   Still, some groups   are bypassing the messy process of taking physical donations entirely.       PRxPR , a group formed by Puerto Rican business leaders, has raised $530,000 to date. It has been parceling out small grants to individuals and organizations on the island for urgent priorities like generators and water filters, if they can be found in stores. But distributing those goods to the people who need them remains difficult.   ""You get a private cargo plane landing in the Aguadilla airport, and when that plane lands, is that there's not enough personnel to help unload the plane,"" said PRxPR co-founder Carmen Baez of the groups flying aid in. ""There's not enough personnel to guard the merchandise, to load the trucks, to drive the trucks to where they're needed.""   This was a particular problem at the Port of San Juan, where pallets of aid sat uncollected for days, in large part because drivers  couldn't make the journey  to pick up supplies.   Puerto Rican groups with local ties had an easier time.  Puerto Rican Agenda , a 22-year-old community organization in Chicago,   flew aid into Puerto Rico using two planes donated by United. Omar Torres-Kortright, a member of the group, says local politicians like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz helped make sure transportation was available at the airport and paperwork didn't hold anything up.    ""As long as our shipments are directed to municipal leaders like her, we do cut through the red tape,"" said Torres-Kortright. ""The mayor of San Juan goes directly to the airport with her trucks, says 'That's my plane, it's my stuff,' and distributes it.""   The groups that have mobilized in the wake of Maria know their efforts won't be enough — so they're pushing for policy measures, like forgiveness of the island's enormous debt, and an exemption from the Jones Act, which only permits shipping to the island from other U.S. ports to be carried out by U.S. vessels.   Javier Ferrer, who runs Houston's Puerto Rican and Cuban Festival, says that a Norwegian company offered to send a ship from New Orleans to San Juan with 53 containers of aid a few days after the storm. But by the time the White House announced a  10-day break in enforcement  of the Jones Act, it would have been too late to get the ship loaded and out to the island.   ""That law needs to be lifted -- not temporarily, but permanently,"" Ferrer said.   The Hispanic Federation, which has raised more than $14 million for Puerto Rico and is still chartering planes to send aid, is ramping up calls for a more robust effort from Washington.   ""It's been tremendously frustrating, to say the least, to see the lack of adequate response from our federal government,"" said Hispanic Federation president Jose Calderon. ""There's only so much that the diaspora can do.""

69,"Amid Puerto Rico's Water Crisis, Unions Step In Where Trump Is Failing",Jennifer Bendery,10/23/17,"WASHINGTON ― Nearly 1 million Americans in Puerto Rico still have no drinking water, more than a month after Hurricane Maria destroyed the island. Some have resorted todrinking from wells at hazardous Superfund sites. Others have been drinking water from creeks that sick animals have urinated in ― and have died as a result.President Donald Trump has given no indication that he is concerned. “I give ourselves a 10” out of 10, he said last week, when asked how he’d rate his response to the humanitarian crisis on the U.S. island. That’s led a group of unions and nonprofits to take matters into their own hands withOperation Agua, a new program to fund and deliver water filtration devices directly to people’s houses, schools and relief centers around the island.“We’re talking about getting 100,000 of these water purifiers into the homes of Puerto Ricans so they can filter their water so it’s safe for drinking, bathing and cooking,” Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, told HuffPost on Monday.AFT and other groups leading the effort, including Operation Blessing and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, have begun raising money to provide at least 100,000 individual water filtration systems and 50 large-capacity clean water devices for schools and community centers. They’ve already figured out how to deal with the fact that 80 percent of the island has no power: the Kohler Clarity filter, which uses gravity, not electricity, to remove more than 99 percent of bacteria in water.Weingarten said one of these filters can purify up to 10.5 gallons of water per day, which is the amount of drinking water needed by a typical family.“Hopefully, the concerts and other groups that have gotten big donations will contribute to this effort,” she said. “But now, with a $30 contribution, someone can get a family one of these water purifiers.”FEMA and military personnel have been on the island for weeks, and they have helped to get bottled water to some communities. But Trump has come under fire for his sluggish response to the disaster, and there have been numerous reports of distribution problems. Some volunteer nurses on the ground told HuffPost earlier this month that government officials have been hoarding bottled water at a central location and requiring people to come pick it up, versus sending workers into communities to deliver it. That has prevented some older and less mobile residents from getting any food or water, they said.“These people are going to have an epidemic. These people are going to die,” said Alicia Schwartz, one of those nurses. “The help is not really there for them.”Weingarten, who has helped with past disaster relief responses for 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, was in Puerto Rico earlier this month. She said she drove around the island for 10 hours at a time, between towns hit hard by the hurricane, and was shocked by the “grossly inadequate” government presence.“I did not see a FEMA truck. I saw one military truck. I saw four electrical crews. That’s it,” Weingarten said. “For the president to say they have gotten everything they needed and it’s the municipalities that are failing is completely wrong. What is unusual is the dearth of a federal response and the enormous vacuum that not-for-profits have to fill. That’s just wrong.”Want to chip in some money to help a fellow American have drinking water?

138,"Puerto Rico wants Amazon's second headquarters, too",Julia Horowitz,10/23/17,"Virtually every city and state in North America wants to host Amazon's second headquarters. That includes Puerto Rico.  The hurricane-battered U.S. territory managed to submit its application to  Amazon   ( AMZN )  by last Thursday's deadline.     ""We have completed and fulfilled the application to enter the race for Amazon's headquarters,"" Puerto Rico's Economic Development and Commerce Department said on Facebook over the weekend.   It's no secret that Puerto Rico is a long-shot candidate. Much of its infrastructure has been decimated   by Hurricane Maria, which slammed the island on September 20. Only 23% of the island has electricity, according to government data. One quarter is without running water.   ""We know we are the underdogs of the group,"" Manuel Laboy, the economic development agency's top official, told Puerto Rican news outlet  El Nuevo Dia .     But Puerto Rico wanted to show that it could bounce back from Maria, according to Laboy.   It could also really use the $5 billion investment and 50,000 jobs that will come with Amazon's so-called HQ2.   The hurricane left parts of the island in ruin. Many of its 3.4 million residents have left -- and there are concerns about whether they'll return. The government estimates that it will be  two more months  before 95% of power is restored.    Even before the hurricane, the territory's economy needed a boost. Amid an 11-year recession, Puerto Rico filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history back in May. Unemployment was  more than double the national rate , and many  young workers  were looking for jobs elsewhere.   Amazon said Monday that  238 cities and regions  throughout the U.S., Mexico and Canada submitted bids for HQ2.    -- CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this report.

140,How a month of hurricane nightmares changed Puerto Rico --  and me,Leyla Santiago,10/21/17," I am writing this in the dark. The hotel doesn't have power, and one of the generators failed. I had to walk up 10 flights of stairs to get to my hotel room because the elevators don't work. The lights have been flickering all night. Such is life here. If that's my biggest problem, however, I consider myself lucky. I've covered devastation. I've covered disaster. I've covered destruction. Hurricane Maria was more.  It has upended the lives of 3.4 million people. It has cut off entire towns from each other. It has left residents without water to drink or bathe in. Enough aid has not come for many. The gravity of the recovery time is starting to set in. Maria also devastated the people I call family, and destroyed the island that molded me into the person I am today. So for me, covering the devastation was personal. I owed it to the island that has given me so much. I was born here, and while I left when I was 3, I have returned for so many holidays. It's where I spent my summers and where I was married. I fought the winds as the Category 4 storm smashed into Puerto Rico on September 20 and then reported the devastation around San Juan. Most roads were closed so to see the impact outside the capital, we had to take to the air.  I was flying over an island I didn't recognize. It had no color. The once lush trees had been stripped of all shades of green. It was hard to find any power lines still standing. Even the typically bright turquoise of the ocean was muted. We flew to some of the most remote, rural and hardest hit areas: Yauco, Utuado and Quebradillas. I will never forget how I was greeted.  When our chopper touched down in Quebradillas, a woman ran to embrace me. She was crying, desperately explaining she needed to reach her family in New Jersey. She hugged tightly, and didn't let go quickly. I was the first outsider she had seen since the hurricane hit. Word spread quickly. The town surrounded us within minutes. No one knew who we were. They didn't ask for food or money. They were curious. Did we have cell service? Did we know what was happening in other towns? As with other towns, we were their only source of news and the only way to share their own. They begged for help relaying messages home. I asked for a list of names, numbers and a message. I promised them I would call later. Then it was time to leave. Amid the chaos, I didn't even get the woman's name.  ... As we left Quebradillas to return to San Juan, the pilot asked if I needed to see anything else. I asked him to fly over Corozal, a mountainous community in the interior.   He said we didn't have enough fuel to land, but a flyover was feasible. When he announced ""This is Corozal,"" I was scared to look out the window. I was dreading what I would see. ""Whoa, it looks like a bomb went off here,"" the pilot says. He didn't know it was my hometown, where my family has lived since the 1800s.  I had to look. I didn't recognize what I saw. Trees were down, debris was scattered everywhere. For a few minutes, I couldn't even find a landmark to orient myself at all to the town I called home.  And I couldn't control the tears as we circled the destruction from above. I felt so helpless having family down there, but not being able to land, to reach them. I snapped a picture. I left with a lot of guilt, thinking Corozal should have been my first stop. When I got back to the hotel, I called my family in Florida. I told them Corozal didn't look good, but I couldn't bring myself to share the photo. And then my crew and I pulled out the names and numbers given to me earlier to call friends and families and deliver news. One note read simply: One of the many notes handed to CNN asking to relay information to families. 1. Tony OK 2. Tony @ Frank's House 3. Villa damaged but repairable 4. Cell out 5. Love you all! We made call after call, trying to share as much as we could with loved ones. ... A couple of days after flying over Corozal, I overheard that the road was now clear.  Soon, I was on that road. For 45 minutes from San Juan to Corozal, my heart was pounding. We stopped at a shelter on the way to my family's street. I was appalled. More than 120 people were now living in the town's high school classrooms. There were children with asthma, an elderly woman with Parkinson's disease, and a woman with cancer. The staff was struggling to meet their needs. The generator was out. All of the food in the refrigerator had spoiled. The bathrooms were becoming unsanitary. People needed medicine. It had been nine days since the hurricane. Corozal was in horrible shape. They needed help. And after seeing the shelter, I needed to find my family. I went straight to my uncle's house. I'm not sure if I waited for the car to stop before I jumped out. I saw my uncle's car shop was destroyed, the roof completely ripped off. I walked in through the open door and shouted his name from the living room. That's when I saw him, and my other family members. They were OK.  My uncle Jesus and I couldn't stop hugging. He kept describing the damage as we hugged.  ""I know, Tio, I flew over here a few days ago but I couldn't land,"" I admitted to my uncle in tears. ""It's OK,"" he said as he hugged me again. ""We're OK."" And that's all I needed to hear. As days turned into weeks, the reality of the scope of damage across the island has become even more clear.  To tell the story of what life has become, we decided to try to find the woman from the mountainside who hugged me so tightly just days after the hurricane. We headed to her municipality, asking around and showing the video of the hug on my cell phone. We found a family member who showed us to her home. Her name was Brenda. She immediately recognized me, and gave me another tight hug. Not much help has arrived since my last visit.

One of Brenda's children decided the conditions were no longer safe, that her 3-year-old grandchildren should go to Florida and Connecticut, where they had other family. Three years old. That's the age when I left Puerto Rico, with my military family for a posting in Panama and then South Carolina. The circumstances are so different, but I know those children's lives will change forever.  ... But then, Puerto Rico has also changed forever. The struggles are everywhere. And where there is help or supplies, there are lines, always lines. Some days, it would be people lining up for gas. And then for food at the supermarket. The longest lines were now to use the ATM. I became numb to the lines quickly.  When we passed another long one at the port, I didn't think anything of it. Until it hit me.  Thousands were lining up to leave Puerto Rico. I watched as an old man dragged an oxygen tank, while pleading with organizers to let him on that massive cruise ship now acting as a refugee transport. Another man lifted his shirt to show the scars from an operation, hoping it would convince the right people that he needed to get off the island. The last time I saw a cruise ship anchored here, I could hear music and laughter coming from tourists on board. This time, there were no celebrations. These weren't tourists. The ship would soon be filled with thousands of Puerto Ricans carrying suitcases fleeing the hurricane-ravaged island.  How could one hurricane force so many to leave their homes?  The images unfolding before my eyes reminded me of scenes from the 1950s, when a wave of Puerto Ricans left the island, most permanently.  Many in today's exodus said the plan was to ""come back."" I couldn't help but wonder how many would actually return.  As the line dwindled, my heart seemed to do the same. The sun set. All passengers boarded. The horn blasted, and I sobbed. I shed more tears for that line than anything else I encountered on this island over the last month. I found myself humming the words to a famous song in Puerto Rico. It is the song my grandfather sang to me when I was a child back in Corozal, ""En Mi Viejo San Juan."" Me voy, ya me voy, pero un día volveré (I am leaving, I am now leaving, but someday I will return.) A buscar mi querer (to search for my love) A soñar otra vez (to dream once again)  En mi viejo San Juan. (In my old San Juan) My dream, after Maria, is that someday they will return -- to the island I remember.

142,Workers are dangling from helicopters to fix Puerto Rico's power lines,Bill Weir and Rachel Clarke,10/20/17," Power workers with no fear of heights are being hoisted up by helicopter in the mountains of Puerto Rico to repair the island's devastated transmission lines.  About 300 are in Puerto Rico already and 700 more are on the way, contracted by a fairly new company based in Montana, of all places.  Montana may be 3,000 miles from Puerto Rico and far from tropical, but Andrew Techmanski, the CEO of Whitefish Energy, says his workers and contractors have the skills needed to get the island back on line.  They're used to working in rough, mountainous terrain, dangling from a helicopter and clambering high up on transmission towers to get power lines up.  Still, when the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority agreed to a $300 million deal with  Whitefish Energy  without consulting the Army Corps of Engineers, it caused a stir.  Techmanski demurs when asked about the deal with PREPA, the publicly owned utility notorious for high prices, rolling blackouts and a $9 billion debt. ""It's a risk,"" he concedes. ""But you know, when you come down here and you see what I've seen and have that skill set that can have an immediate impact on the people here, it becomes a mission."" PREPA CEO Ricardo Ramos told CNN en Español that one reason Whitefish got the deal was because  the company did not demand a big deposit up front . He said the other finalist, which he did not name, wanted a $25 million down payment.  Techmanski predicts the massive central line currently being worked on outside San Juan will be back up in three or four days. But, he says, it will take many months and thousands more people to meet  Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's promise that 95% of the island will have power  by December 15.  ""We have over 100 pieces of equipment -- bucket trucks, tool trailers, bulldozers -- stuck in ports in Florida,"" Techmanski says. When they are not dangling from helicopters or clinging to towers, he says, his men have been scouring neighborhoods for unused heavy machinery. The need for that power is obvious anywhere you go. At night, most places are dark because the lights don't turn on. Inside homes, there's no air conditioning, no refrigerator to keep food or even a beer cold. Schools are closed, and hospitals struggle.  Dr. Rosita Arzuaga shows us around the hospital that serves  La Perla, the low-income neighborhood of San Juan that had been enjoying a tourist boom  since it was featured in the most viewed music video ever, for the Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee phenomenon ""Despacito."" Outside, the buildings are as colorful as ever, but Arzuaga explains she has to treat patients in the dark. This is a neighborhood where people look after each other. Even Fonsi has joined in, donating five generators to the people of La Perla.  But they aren't turned on yet, still wrapped up somewhere in red tape.  There's no knowing when the lights will come back on in La Perla. But, as everywhere on this beautiful but battered island, it can't happen soon enough.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/20/us/puerto-rico-montana-power-repairs-weir/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjo_6Sg7cj6AhU2ZjABHUdAAvQ4jgIQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw3oc01p9D8Cc24vQ0NdE_hD,CNN,Liberal
72,Bernie Sanders Cancels Appearance At Women's Convention To Go To Puerto Rico,Alanna Vagianos,10/20/17,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Thursday afternoon he will not be attending and speaking at the Women’s Convention in Detroit, Mich. Instead, Sanders is heading to Puerto Rico to offer aid after Hurricane Maria. “I want to apologize to the organizers of the Women’s Convention for not being able to attend your conference next Friday in Detroit,” Sanders said in a statement. “Given the emergency situation in Puerto Rico, I will be traveling there to visit with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and other officials to determine the best way forward to deal with the devastation the island is experiencing.”Sanders congratulated the Women’s March organizers and gave best wishes for a successful conference. A few hour after Sanders’ announcement, the Women’s March organizers released a statement on Twitter, writing: “We were grateful that Senator Sanders had accepted our invitation to continue his longstanding record of support and allyship for women leaders... We understand his leadership is needed in Puerto Rico and, as always, we deeply appreciate his commitment to communities in need.” The Women’s March received backlash last week after announcing that Sanders would be the conference’s opening night speaker on Friday, Oct. 27. Many people criticized the Women’s March’s choice to start a women’s empowerment event with a male speaker. One critic created a petition to remove Sanders from kicking off the Women’s Convention and received over 1,300 signatures in support. Others noted that Sanders’ campaigned last year on behalf of a Democratic mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska who is anti-abortion. “We have got to appreciate where people come from, and do our best to fight for the pro-choice agenda,” Sanders said to NPR in response to criticism. “But I think you just can’t exclude people who disagree with us on one issue.”Convention leaders countered critics, pointing out that the weekend’s program included 60 women speakers and just two men. They also added that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Ca.) was the keynote speaker and her now-iconic “reclaiming my time” line is the theme of the entire weekend. Two days after the initial announcement about Sanders, Women’s March apologized for any pain they had caused and clarified that women’s voices are absolutely playing the central role in the convention. Sanders was slated to appear on a Friday night panel before bowing out of the convention altogether this week. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mi.) took Sanders’ place as the opening night speaker on Friday night, and Rep. Waters will be speaking on Saturday during the Women’s Convention weekend.

71,Doctors Fear A Potentially Deadly Disease Outbreak In Puerto Rico,Carolina Moreno,10/20/17,"CAROLINA, Puerto Rico ― Christian Romero sat in near darkness in the stairwell of his apartment building. The glare from his phone illuminated his face, as he swiped through photos of his late brother Romsy.“I feel like a part of me is missing,” Romero, 28, told HuffPost. He spoke calmly, but his eyes bore the weight of countless sleepless nights. “He was older than me by a year and three months. We literally grew up together, hand by hand, doing the same things, going to the same places.”Romsy Romero died on Oct. 5. His brother says doctors told the family they suspect he was infected with leptospirosis, an animal-borne bacterial disease that can be fatal if not properly treated in time.In the four weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, leaving the island largely without power and with limited access to drinking water, doctors fear Romsy’s case is hardly unique.On Thursday, Puerto Rico state epidemiologist Carmen Deseda announced there are 74 suspected leptospirosis cases reported in October. The number significantly surpassed its average of 60 reported cases a year for the disease. Four of the suspected 74 cases resulted in death.The Puerto Rican government continues to assuage public fears as they await formal confirmation of deaths related to the disease, but doctors told HuffPost the U.S. territory is ripe for an outbreak of leptospirosis and other endemic diseases on the island if more aggressive preventive action isn’t taken soon.‘The potential for outbreak is imminent’Leptospirosis is spread through the urine of infected animals, including rats, pigs, dogs and horses. When a person comes into contact with water, mud or soil that has been contaminated by an infected animal’s urine, the bacteria can enter the body through open abrasions or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose and mouth, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current conditions in Puerto Rico are ripe for this type of infection.Common symptoms include high fever, headache, chills, fatigue and muscle aches, said clinical epidemiologist David Capó, who previously worked at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and now serves as a consultant at Abarca Health in San Juan. Leptospirosis is rarely contagious between humans.The disease often mimics many viral infections, making it hard to diagnose, Capó said. It is often underreported or misdiagnosed as dengue, a viral disease transmitted via mosquitoes. But unlike dengue, leptospirosis can be treated early on by using antibiotics. If left untreated, in some strains of the disease, patients may hemorrhage in the lungs or experience kidney failure and die.Capó said the government isn’t responding quickly enough. Officials need to communicate the risks of the disease to both patients and doctors on the island.“I would say the island is at risk of outbreaks of influenza, leptospirosis, dengue,” Capó said. “The potential for outbreak is imminent.”‘The suspicion is so great that you don’t need to wait for lab results’A doctor at Dr. Federico Trilla Hospital in Carolina who spoke to HuffPost says he knows of at least one death connected to leptospirosis and three current suspected cases being treated.“There are cases, that despite not being confirmed, the suspicion is so great that you don’t need to wait for lab results,” said Dr. Cruz, whose name has been changed because he did not have permission to speak on record. “There was a patient, a 28-year-old man that in less than five days the disease killed him.” Dr. Cruz, who received details of the case from a fellow doctor at the hospital, told HuffPost that the patient had gone to three different hospitals before arriving at Dr. Federico Trilla hospital, around 13 miles east of San Juan. At each hospital he had been discharged with a virus diagnosis. No doctor had considered leptospirosis.By the time the patient arrived at Dr. Cruz’s hospital he was experiencing organ failure. Compounding the problem: the hospital had no functioning intensive care unit due to a lack of electricity. Despite the administering of antibiotics, and an attempted transfer to a hospital with a working intensive care unit in San Juan, it was too late.“In less than four hours of having been in our hospital with suspected leptospirosis, he died,” Dr. Cruz said.‘Once it’s too late, I’ll be blunt, the patient will die’Officials in the government say they are working to prevent outbreaks. Puerto Rican governor Ricardo Roselló told Huffpost the deaths that are suspected to be linked to leptospirosis are pending confirmation from the CDC.When asked if the health system on the island currently had the infrastructure to deal with a possible outbreak of any disease, Roselló admitted that the hospital system is “very frail,” with only 20 hospitals running on the electric grid and the rest running only partially on generators.As far as preventive measures for outbreaks, Roselló assured HuffPost that his government was doing an “aggressive” campaign with flyers.But, Dr. Cruz says he hasn’t heard of any campaigns, and he feels the government should not be waiting for CDC confirmation of leptospirosis deaths before alerting communities of the risks.“We have all of the elements for that bacteria to grow and spread, and with preventative antibiotics, we can save lives,” Dr, Cruz added. “Because once it’s too late, I’ll be blunt, the patient will die regardless of what we do. And it’s up to a 70 percent mortality rate if the infection reaches the lungs.” ‘We never imagined that he would die’As the coquí frogs began to sing in the background, Christian Romero described the circumstances of his brother’s death. Romero suspects his brother contracted the disease when he washed his clothes in a nearby river. Without running water or electricity there was no where else to do it.“Romsy was always a strong man, an athlete, a baseball player,” said Romero, who works as counselor for patients who suffer from substance abuse. “He was a regular person that felt sick and looked like he had a virus. Everybody recovers from that. One or two days pass by and you get back to normal.”At the health center the doctors told Romero and his family what leptospirosis was, that it was very dangerous, he added. “That’s why we took him to the hospital. We never imagined that he would die.”Romero said his brother, who lived in Guaynabo, lost 15 pounds in the days that the disease progressed, something that was “devastating” for his family to witness after having known him as a fit and healthy man. He also said he hoped his brother, who was the father to a 7-year-old girl, will be remembered for how much he loved to help people.“The days after the hurricane, he would help his neighbors clean their water cisterns,” Romero said. “[I remember him] checking on people whose homes were flooded, unclogging culverts, so that people would be okay.”Before his death, one of Romsy’s goals had been to join the U.S. Army. Romero said the decision was motivated by the economic situation in Puerto Rico and because he wanted to “contribute to his country.”Romero has had very little time to mourn his brother. He and his family are still living with the aftermath of the hurricane, just like the millions of other Puerto Ricans on the island.“The same can be happening to other people who can be getting infected with this or another bacteria,” he said. “We listen in the radio all the time about problems with the gas, about lack of food, about problems with the water ... It is a lot of information that generates a lot of uncertainty. We fear for our health, for our lives.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/leptospirosis-outbreak-puerto-rico-hurrincane_n_59e905aae4b0f9d35bc969ac,HuffPost,Liberal
70,"One Month Since Maria Hit Puerto Rico, President Trump Must Commit To Long-Term Recovery","Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Contributor",10/20/17,"Since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico one month ago, President Trump has made a number of bizarre statements, typically via Twitter, about the federal government’s obligations to relief efforts, the status of relief efforts and the Americans living in Puerto Rico. Although the statements were often incorrect and at times profoundly offensive, I tried to concentrate on the disaster relief mission and hoped that he too would take on this mission with a greater sense of obligation – rather than the cavalier manner in which he approaches public relations.Yet for reasons none of us can understand, he has called into question the federal government’s commitment to supporting the long-term recovery for Puerto Rico. He has tweeted that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the first responders in Puerto Rico can’t stay there forever and has repeated this many times since. Of course, the federal responders have only been there for less than four weeks – hardly forever. But the president’s eagerness to high-tail it out of Puerto Rico came as a surprise since just last month his FEMA administrator declared to the people of Texas after Hurricane Harvey hit that “FEMA is going to be there for years.” Why a commitment to Texas but not Puerto Rico?As we all know, the recovery has barely begun in Puerto Rico: 78 percent of Puerto Ricans are still without electricity, 28 percent are without water and access to food and fuel is still limited. Worse yet, we heard last week that people in Puerto Rico, desperate for water, have been forced to resort to pump water from drinking wells located at a Superfund site, despite warnings from the Environmental Protection Agency.Needless to say, the president’s threats were of no consolation to the people of Puerto Rico, whom the president must realize are our fellow American citizens. While anyone can guess what is going on in the president’s mind, it is beyond comprehension that he is champing at the bit to get the federal government out of Puerto Rico and leave its people to somehow recover and rebuild on their own. It would be tragic if the president has made some sort of political calculus that helping Puerto Rico is of no benefit – or worse.Responding to and recovering from disasters takes time, it takes commitment, and it takes transparency. Earlier this month, media outlets reported that FEMA was not providing consistent information about the status of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico on its website. There were also disturbing stories that official figures regarding the number of Hurricane Maria-related deaths may be unknown or not being reported accurately. It seems that the president and the administration is participating in a nonstop spin campaign, desperate to assure everyone they are doing a fantastic job.This may seem obvious to most, but we must be sure we have a federal government that is forthright and candid with the American public about the state of recovery in Puerto Rico, particularly because that information is necessary to understand the nature of federal resources that will be required to help it recover. I was able to visit Puerto Rico earlier this month – and it is clear that the real story of what is happening there is not coming through.In fact, every bit of news coming from Puerto Rico over the past month points to a woefully inadequate federal response and a humanitarian crisis. I, along with my colleagues in Congress, have implored the Trump administration to bring all federal resources to bear and establish a rebuilding task force that will help the areas affected by this season’s hurricanes build back stronger. This has still not happened. Instead we receive near daily tweets from the president blaming the Puerto Rican people for their predicament and questioning the federal government’s commitment to Puerto Rico’s recovery.President Trump must shift his focus off of Twitter to the people of Puerto Rico and confirm his commitment to the immediate response and long-term recovery efforts. Americans are Americans, regardless of the language they speak, the color of their skin, or whether they can vote in a presidential election. And all Americans deserve the same level commitment from the president.Those of us in Congress are eager to work with him in the months and years to come as we work to help Puerto Rico recover from this horrific disaster. Tweets cannot change the facts on the ground. I urge the president not to let this people of this nation live through another Hurricane Katrina under his watch.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
141,About 1 million Americans without running water. 3 million without power. This is life one month after Hurricane Maria.,John D. Sutter,10/20/17," After Hurricane Maria toppled the bridge that connects him to the rest of civilization and ripped the roof and walls off his house here in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, Ramón Sostre raised a weathered American flag above the wreckage.  His message to the world: I'm alive, and I'm American. It worked, if temporarily. Helicopters came. So did a tarp, food and bottled water.  Yet little else has changed. His roof is still missing, as are some walls. He and his cat, Tipo, sleep in the kitchen. When the wind blows at night, rain soaks them. The power is out, as it is for roughly 3 million Puerto Ricans, or more than 80% of the island's residents. More than a third   of households in the US territory, including much of Sostre's community, are without reliable drinking water at home. That's roughly 1 million American citizens. One month after Hurricane Maria, these realities are starting to feel less like an emergency and more like the new way of life -- a nightmarish loop that resets each day the sun rises.  ""You wake up and it's this mess as far as the eye can see,"" Sostre told me.  Much of the island feels like it was hit by a storm yesterday  The US government says it is committed to helping Puerto Rico but is confronted with challenging circumstances, including some roads that are narrow, muddied and impassable for large aid-delivery vehicles. There also are pre-existing problems with power and water systems. Puerto Rico is ""an island sitting in the middle of an ocean ... a very big ocean,"" as President Donald Trump said on September 26, making Hurricane Maria more distant than two other recent storms that hit the US mainland, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  After traveling the island for three days, however, and conducting interviews with residents and federal officials and experts, it's clear the level of suffering is far outpacing relief.  Much of the island feels as if it were hit by a storm yesterday, not one month ago. Mountains are covered in branchless trees, stuck in the dirt like the walking sticks of giants. Power lines are tangled about like spaghetti dropped from the sky. Sheet metal from roofs and fencing has been turned into floppy strips of chewing gum, scattered on the hills. Not only are people such as Sostre exposed to the elements, but supplies of clean drinking water are woefully inadequate and environmental health experts fear a public health emergency could be brewing.  On Tuesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said it had 1,700 personnel deployed in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, which also were hit by Hurricane Maria. Yet nearly 2,600 FEMA staff -- about 900 more -- remain deployed to Hurricane Harvey, nearly two months after that storm hit the Gulf Coast of the mainland United States.  In their defense, FEMA officials point out also that 20,000 other federal staff and military have been deployed to respond to Hurricane Maria.  ""(P)lease understand that every disaster is different geographically and demographically and there is no point of comparison from one to the other. Numbers are a snapshot in time for any given day; it is like comparing apples to oranges,"" FEMA said in an emailed statement. ""Please note that numbers do not save or improve lives, missions and progress do; for example, (Texas) may need more people to support housing, while (Puerto Rico) may need more generators and poles to support the grid."" Others see it differently.  ""I thought we'd learned our lesson after (Hurricane) Katrina where the response was awful, both carelessly slow and incompetent,"" said John Mutter, a professor at Columbia University and an expert in international disaster relief. ""In Puerto Rico, it doesn't look like we've learned anything at all -- or we just don't care."" 'If I don't drink water, I'm going to die' The situation is particularly bad when it comes to water.  There are 3.4 million people in Puerto Rico, and about 35% of households were without access to safe drinking water as of Tuesday, according to government estimates. The World Health Organization says each person needs at least 2.5 liters per day for drinking alone, with a recommended daily allotment of up to 15 liters per day   including basic cooking and hygiene.  Yet FEMA has provided 23.6 million liters -- 6.2 million gallons -- of bottled water and bulk water since the storm hit on September 20, said Justo Hernandez, FEMA's deputy federal coordinating officer. That includes water delivered to hospitals and dialysis centers, he said.  That's only roughly 9% of the drinking water needs for the entire territory.  It's an even smaller fraction if you include basic cooking and hygiene needs.  ""The potential for cholera and diarrheal diseases is quite high"" without bottled water, said Mutter, the disaster recovery expert at Columbia in New York, who recommended the WHO standard. ""What you will get is contaminated wells and surface water. It's a situation where you really should be drinking bottled water. If you can't get bottled water ... that's trouble.""  Volunteer groups and nonprofits also are helping with supplies. FEMA says it has distributed drinking-water purification tablets and deployed six mobile-filtration systems. And there are efforts to distribute water-purification tablets and to tell locals who can't find bottled water either to boil the water or add bleach or water-purification tablets.  But many residents remain desperate, week after week, for drinking water. Lines for water -- potable or not -- are long in many parts of the island. Rumors of contamination are rampant. Even as some taps turn back on, residents worry about drinking from faucets, which sputter and, in some locations, produce hazy liquid. Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, the water utility in Puerto Rico, says on its website that residents should boil the water and add bleach even after service is restored. In Dorado, near the capital, San Juan, people are so desperate for water they've turned to a federal hazardous-waste site in search of something to drink.  CNN has reported that people are breaking through a fence marked ""danger"" to pull water from a Superfund site  in an area known to be contaminated with industrial chemicals linked to cancer. It's unclear if the wells are unsafe for public health; the Environmental Protection Agency is conducting water tests on wells on the Superfund site.   ""If I don't drink water, I'm going to die. So I might as well drink this water,"" one resident said. 'There is a public health crisis here' One afternoon, I met Wilfredo Santiago while he was collecting water from a spout along Highway 10. The area smelled something like a pet store, and Santiago told me there likely are dead squirrels, rats and horses in the hills.  Santiago knows it may be unsafe, but his 9-year-old daughter bathed in the water stream while he filled up a number of plastic bottles with the liquid. A line of cars waited to do the same. He took the water home to an apartment complex in Utuado, an interior city. On the floor in the kitchen, there were 37 jugs of the stuff, bottled in containers meant for Sprite, Pepsi and cranberry juice. The family collects water from a gutter to flush the toilet. There's no running water here, and bottled water is expensive and hard to come by, he told me. The grocery store in town had none. Deliveries to the area by government officials come infrequently, he said.  Across the street is the municipal emergency management office, which helps distribute FEMA aid. Héctor Cruz Cruz, its director, told me everyone in that complex is fine -- they all get bottled water delivered through the complex's manager. He disputed the claims of Santiago and about a half-dozen of his neighbors who said they are short on water and often struggle to find it.  ""It's dangerous,"" Santiago told me, referring to drinking and bathing with water from the mountains, ""but we have no choice.""  All of this is concerning to public health experts.  ""Our biggest worry is that as people get desperate and sort of give up on safe water sources that they are going to rely on things like streams and pipes that just come out of a spring or a mountain,"" said Erik Olson, head of the health program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ""It's just really a desperate situation.""  ""There is a public health crisis here,"" Catherine Kennedy, a vice president at National Nurses United, said from Puerto Rico. ""They need water. And we haven't seen much of FEMA."" 'I step out of my bed and there's water' Hernandez, the FEMA official, said this relief effort is ""a marathon,"" not a sprint.  But President Donald Trump already is emphasizing the finite nature of federal attention.  ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!"" Trump tweeted on October 12.  Carmen Rivera Rodriguez, a 55-year-old resident of ""P.R.,"" didn't see that tweet. She has heard next to nothing about Trump or the federal response to this storm. When we met outside a supermarket in Comerío, about 20 miles southeast of Sostre and his American flag, she told me she hasn't even been able to reach her son   in the mainland United States because there's virtually no cellular service here -- 75% of antennas are down -- and she doesn't have a car.  Rivera was wearing a cast on her left arm. She fell while trying to sweep rain out of her living room.  That was October 11 -- 21 days after the storm.  Rivera invited me to her home, which is on a cleared and accessible road on the side of a mountain. When you step inside the house, your foot splashed in inch-deep water, sending ripples throughout the home across linoleum floors. This is what she was scraping with a squeegee when she slipped and fell. Her roof is gone, except for over the kitchen and a small garage, where she sleeps. And it rains most afternoons here, lately. ""Just imagine. I step out of my bed and there's water. I go to the bathroom and I have to bring an umbrella,"" she said.  The same week Trump visited Puerto Rico, throwing paper towels to hurricane victims on October 3, Rivera told me she heard a truck driving by her home with loudspeakers blaring what seemed like good news: US government workers would be in town tomorrow.  The next morning, she said, she awoke at 4 and hitched a ride into the valley so she could apply for a tarp to stop it from raining indoors. Mold is growing on a baby picture of her now-grown son, which hangs on the plywood wall of her living room.  Her right eye is pink and puffy, which she figures is a symptom of being damp for one month.  She waited in line for hours and filled out a government form, she said.  As of October 15, 25 days after the storm, the tarp hadn't come.  FEMA has distributed 38,000 tarps on the island, said Hernandez, the FEMA official.  The need for roofing help is estimated at 60,000 homes, he said.  'Soy americano' Puerto Rico is part of America and yet it isn't.  It's a territory of the richest nation on Earth -- a country founded in opposition to colonialism. It's a place where the federal government oversees a financial crisis and controls certain aspects of commerce and shipping, but where Americans can't cast ballots in presidential general elections, and where the island's one representative in Congress can't vote, either.  Sostre, the man who was trapped on the other side of a broken bridge, was right to fly the Stars and Stripes above his home and to say, ""Soy americano,"" or ""I'm an American."" Rivera, for her part, doesn't think much about the politics.  She only wants to stay safe and dry.  Nights have been the hardest, she said as darkness fell over her neighborhood and the island's coquí frogs began their electronic chorus. Rain splashed on the floor as she talked. The situation is so bad Rivera prays to God asking that if another storm comes, she won't survive it.  ""I'm not ready to live through something like that again,"" she said, crying.  The truth is she's still living it.  CNN's Claudia Morales, Madeleine Stix, Cristian Arroyo   and Lorraine Martinez contributed to this report.

143,Trump now says Puerto Rico faced 'worse than Katrina',Jeremy Diamond and Ashley Killough,10/19/17," President Donald Trump  said Thursday that  Puerto Rico faced a situation ""worse than Katrina""  as he explained why he was rating his administration's response to the hurricane a 10 out of 10. ""It was probably the most difficult when you talk about relief, when you talk about search, when you talk about all the different levels. Even when you talk about lives saved,"" Trump told the press during a White House meeting with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. ""I think it was worse."" Trump previously compared the situation in Puerto Rico to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina during his visit to the island earlier this month when he suggested Hurricane Maria wasn't ""a real catastrophe, like Katrina"" in terms of the number of casualties. Trump on Thursday appeared to flip the comparison to his benefit, suggesting that the devastation in Puerto Rico was worse than in New Orleans during Katrina -- but the federal response was far more competent. Trump's argument: Puerto Rico was first partially hit by Hurricane Irma and then hit ""dead center"" by Hurricane Maria, which was just a couple miles per hour away from a Category 5 hurricane. Rosselló, ahead the meeting, said he plans on discussing ""pressing needs"" with the President. He said a lot of work has been done on the island in the aftermath of the hurricane, ""but there's still a lot of work to go ahead."" Rosselló met earlier Thursday with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who's been heavily engaged in Puerto Rico's recovery, before heading to the White House in the afternoon.   ""In these emergencies, things might have the appearance that they are stabilizing at one point, but you always have future problems that can arise such as public health emergencies and otherwise,"" Rosselló told reporters. ""We really want to take all of the big picture."" Trump has taken heat for his handling of the response to the devastation on the island,  most notably after he tweeted last week that Washington could not keep aiding Puerto Rico ""forever.""    ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!"" Trump wrote. White House chief of staff John Kelly said last week that Trump's tweet was ""exactly accurate"" because first responders ""are not going to be there forever."" Rosselló said Puerto Rico needs ""equal treatment"" with Florida, Texas and the US Virgin Islands, which were also hit by massive storms this hurricane season.  ""We're all in this together,"" he told reporters. His visit with the President also comes just days after Trump blamed some of the recovery problems on the island on local distribution efforts. ""We have massive amounts of water,"" Trump said Monday in a news conference. ""We have massive amounts of food, but they have to distribute the food, and they have to do this. They have to distribute the food to the people of the island."" CNN's Suzanne Malveaux asked Rosselló about distribution efforts on the island. ""Right now, it's working. It's augmenting significantly,"" he responded. ""We're working with the municipalities. I've hosted the national guard in Puerto Rico to help with the logistics. I sent out our auditors from the Treasury Department so that they can have accountability over what's going on."" Rosselló said there have been ""investigations"" into the ""proper management"" of resources, but ""our efforts still at this moment are life-sustaining efforts."" As of Thursday, 21.6% of the island had power and 78.6% of gas stations are up and running, according to an official website  with updates on recovery efforts . Rosselló said Thursday morning that the death toll stood at 48 but he was expecting to hear an update later in the day. Last week, the House  approved a $36.5 billion disaster relief bill  in the wake of not only Hurricane Maria but the devastating hurricanes that hit Florida and Texas, as well as a string of wildfires out West. The bill awaits passage by the Senate. Rubio said he was not contesting the amount of money that Congress is trying to send to Puerto Rico but took issue with the requirements Puerto Rico has to meet — like making damage assessments — in order to use the funds. ""They're not going to be able to do that in a timely fashion because they're still out there trying to restore power and get water and food to people,"" he said. Rubio warned that the situation has grown so drastic in Puerto Rico that their government could shut down ""in the next 30-45 days."" Rubio said he was told Thursday morning in the briefing with the governor that the Army Corps of Engineers has yet to begin executing power restoration on the island -- though Rubio cautioned that he needed to confirm that information. ""If that's not accurate and there's another side of that story, we need to learn it. But if that's accurate, then obviously we need to start asking questions as to why,"" he said.

144,There's a hospital ship waiting for sick Puerto Ricans -- but no one knows how to get on it,Leyla Santiago and Mallory Simon,10/17/17," Sammy Rolon is living in a makeshift clinic set up at a school. He has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and is bedridden. He's waiting for surgery that was scheduled before Hurricane Maria smashed   into   Puerto Rico. Now, he can't even get the oxygen he needs.  There is help available for the 18-year-old -- right offshore. A floating state-of-the-art hospital, the USNS Comfort, could provide critical care, his doctor says. But nobody knows how to get him there. And Sammy is not alone.  Clinics that are overwhelmed with patients and staff say they don't even know how to begin sending cases to the ship. Doctors say there's a rumor that patients have to be admitted to a central hospital before they can be transferred to the Comfort.  Only 33 of the 250 beds on the Comfort -- 13% -- are being used, nearly two weeks after the ship arrived.  According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the official protocol is for patients in need to go to their nearest medical facility. If that facility is unable to provide care, a doctor there should contact the medical coordinating center in San Juan. Someone there will then determine whether a patient needs to be transferred to a hospital on the island and which one. In some cases, a determination will be made to transfer a patient to the US Army Combat Support Hospital in Humacao, which has 44 beds and has been operational since Sunday.  The remaining option is for patients to be transferred to the Comfort.  ""Only patients with critical needs requiring specialized care will be transferred to USNS Comfort,"" said Coast Guard Lt. David Connor in an email. He is working at the FEMA Joint Information Center in San Juan.   ""Over 100 patients have been treated to date, conducting logistics and medical support operations in Arecibo and Aguadilla,"" according to  briefing issued by FEMA  on Tuesday.    The hospital ship was deployed as part of the federal response to the storm and its aftermath that has left 3.4 million Americans facing power and communications outages, water and food shortages and at risk for worsening health conditions.  The USS Comfort is waiting; the process laid out by FEMA for patients does not seem clear to local health-care providers. Puerto Rico's Department of Health has to decide which patients can get care aboard the ship. And referrals have been minimal.  CNN asked Gov. Ricardo Rosselló why so many are in need of help and yet a ship with operating rooms and intensive care units sits nearly empty.  ""The disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow,"" Rosselló said.  He acknowledged that the system must get better.  ""I asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there,"" Rosselló said. For doctors and medics in hospitals and makeshift clinics, time is of the essence. It is difficult for them to watch patients suffer, and not be able to provide answers or direction about whether the USNS Comfort is an option. Dr. Jorge Rosado, who oversees Sammy's care at the clinic and works at San Jorge Children's Hospital, says the young man is a prime example. ""He can become acutely ill if he continues to be (at the school),"" he said. ""It's very frustrating. I know they have the capacity; they have the medical staff; they have the supplies. ... To hear there's only 33 patients in such a big mobile hospital -- it's tough."" Capt. Kevin Robinson, the Comfort's mission commander, says help is waiting.

What the situation on the ground is ... that's not in my lane to make a decision,"" he said. ""Every time that we've been tasked by (Puerto Rico's) medical operation center to respond or bring a patient on, we have responded."" For Sammy's father, Jose Cruz, the waiting for a plan is heartbreaking. ""I feel horrible,"" he says. ""Because I can't help him.""

145,Mudslide hits Puerto Rico neighborhood that Trump visited,Bill Weir and Rachel Clarke,10/16/17," Torrential rains washed away weeks of clean-up and brought new problems for Puerto Ricans on Monday. A small creek a few miles outside of San Juan became a raging river, picking up trees, pipes and rubble from a mountainside where they had been dumped after Hurricane Maria. The debris added weight and force to a mudslide that took out a bridge in the Guaynabo neighborhood outside San Juan, stranding families who may now have to hike through mountainous, overgrown terrain   to get food and water.  This is the working class part of the same neighborhood where  President Trump tossed out rolls of paper towels  earlier this month and then handed out lanterns, while telling people they did not need them any more.  Trump's approval rating on handling hurricanes plummets Efrain Diaz saw the bridge tumble, and with it hopes for   his business of restoring Corvettes. ""Everything I've been struggling for all my life, all of a sudden is gone,"" he said. The trailer where he stored parts was tossed in the mudslide and some of his cars totaled.  He and his wife Luz have had no power since Maria hit the island on September 20, and have been spending their savings on gas for the generator to keep the refrigerator on and Luz's life-saving insulin fresh.  Diaz said he has seen no FEMA staff and no distribution of food, fuel or fresh water since Maria came ashore nearly four weeks ago.  When local mayor Angel Perez came by the neighborhood, Luz accused him of forgetting about them. ""We need water,"" she told him.  Trump blames Puerto Rico water problems on local distribution Perez had also been there when President Trump made a show of handing out supplies in the Calvary Chapel, and says that FEMA has helped. ""It's been slowly, but it's there,"" he said. ""They have given us water, food, the tarps."" But it's not enough yet, he said. ""We want more help,"" Perez said. ""We need more help."" And now he has another wish, this time for the Army Corps of Engineers. His town needs a new bridge.

73,Thousands Are Fleeing Puerto Rico. Some Don't Know If They'll Ever Return,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,10/16/17,"Deborah Drahus Capo knew she’d have to leave Puerto Rico the moment she emerged from the bathroom where she had holed up throughout Hurricane Maria last month.For eight hours straight, the San Juan-based attorney had listened to the wind “howling like a monster,” waiting for the windows in her apartment to break. When the storm subsided, the streets in her neighborhood were blocked with debris and the supermarkets were empty. Her daughter’s house nearby had been flooded. There was no electricity or running water.Ten days after the storm devastated the island, Drahus Capo boarded a flight to Florida with her daughter and granddaughter in tow. For now, they’re staying at a friend’s home in Miami.“It’s like they pulled the rug out from under me: I had my life, my clients, and all of a sudden I’m on plane to Miami,” she told HuffPost last week. “What do I plan on doing? I don’t know.” Since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico almost one month ago, thousands of residents have left the U.S. territory. Many are like Drahus Capo ― not knowing when, or if, they’ll return.The storm, whichkilled at least 48 people, hascut power for most of the 3.4 million residents of the island and deprivedmore than a quarter of residents of access to clean drinking water. Most of the recovery seen on the island so far has been concentrated around the capital of San Juan. Entire areas inland remain inaccessible, many supermarkets still don’t carry fresh produce or meat, and many hospitals and clinics are without electricity, leading them to depend on unreliable generators to provide care to the most vulnerable patients. Life on the island has become a daily struggle, forcing thousands to consider whether a better future lies ahead outside of its borders.It’s hard to know the exact number of Puerto Ricans who have fled the island, or how many of those will eventually return, said Edwin Meléndez, economist and director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York.Puerto Rican news outlet El Nuevo Día estimates tens of thousands of residents have left, and The New York Times reported Florida alone has braced for as many as 100,000 arrivals.Meléndez and his colleagues, who have analyzed previous migration numbers for Puerto Rico, as well as evacuation patterns from New Orleans after 2005′s Hurricane Katrina, estimate that between 114,000 and 213,000 Puerto Ricans will eventually depart.Being able to leave and find a place to live elsewhere takes resources, and connections. Flights were difficult to come by after the hurricane, as hundreds of people were stranded at the island’s largest airport in San Juan, which was damaged and closed for days.“Nobody decides to leave everything just because, and hop on a plane with a load of clothes and whatever else you can fit in a bag,” Drahus Capo said. “I have privilege: I have friends [in the mainland], I have savings in place. But that’s not the case for a lot of people.”Drahus Capo’s mother still lives on the island ― she is bedridden and would need special, and costly, flight accommodations.Before the hurricane, Drahus Capo had never considered moving away from her native San Juan ― but that is now a possibility for her and her family.“It was not my plan to come to the mainland, it was never in my options,” she said. Her move was a minute-to-minute decision, but one that might turn out out to be a lifelong one.Drahus Capo’s granddaughter now hopes to enroll in school in Florida, and the attorney may take the bar exam in February, so she can continue practicing law.Once steps like new jobs and children’s schooling are put into motion, it can be hard to move back, especially to an island that will certainly still be in recovery mode for a long time to come.“What do I plan on doing? I don’t know,” Drahus Capo said. “But I can’t sit here and do nothing, and in Puerto Rico there’s not much you can do ― the uncertainty is very bad.”For those who have left, the question becomes when living conditions on the island have returned close enough to normal for them to return ― or whether it will even make sense for them to do so, if they’ve started to build a new life on the mainland.In some parts of the island, the recovery has barely begun.“Our people are dying,” Dennis Flores, a human resources administrator based in New York, told HuffPost in tears over the phone. Flores has been in Jagueyes, a small town in the island’s central region, for the past few days checking on his mom, aunts and cousins.“They are proud people, this is where they’re from, they’re never going to leave,” he said. “This is all they know. They want to rebuild. All I see is people working hard where government is failing them.”Flores said that as of Monday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency still hasn’t yet reached the town, one of many areas far from San Juan that government officials weren’t able to communicate with for days after the hurricane. Flores said there remains no running water in his family’s community, and when people go to the supermarket there is little food available. They often are able to only purchase one gallon of water and perhaps a small amount of gasoline for a generator. The house he had been building for his mother was also destroyed in the storm, he said.The family’s struggles are unlikely to disappear anytime soon.The U.S. House approved $36.5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by recent disasters last Thursday. But Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló estimated there is $95 billion worth of damage on the island.Puerto Rican officials have pleaded with the government for more help, and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz has harshly criticized the Trump administration for its slow response.“Damn it, we are dying,” Mayor Yulín Cruz said in a recent video interview with HuffPost. “This is not getting better as days go by.”Meanwhile, President Donald Trump ― who last month referred to the San Juan Mayor as “nasty” after she called out the government’s slow response ― recently threatened to pull out FEMA aid.“The humanitarian crisis is still unfolding ― it’s all beyond description, it’s apocalyptic,” Meléndez, the Hunter College professor, said. “Is the U.S. going to abandon its citizens of Puerto Rico in a time of great need? Por favor!”Puerto Rico’s exodus comes after the island has already seen its population drop by about 400,000 over the past decade because of a crippling economic recession. With the island more than $70 billion in debt and with an unemployment rate hovering around 10 percent in the last year ― more than twice the national rate ― many had been fleeing to the mainland for better job opportunities before the hurricane.The new departures will further hinder the recovery efforts.“As an economist, my assessment is this economy is in the tank right now,” Meléndez told HuffPost. “How many people want to vacation and see devastation? The tourism season is lost, this winter is lost, [employers] won’t call people to work. It’s going to be a while before you get some normalcy.”With infrastructure like electricity slow to come back, major industries such as pharmaceuticals, tourism and agriculture will take a big hit, and unemployment will spike as working-age people ― especially those with children ― leave, he predicted. Some residents believe that precisely because of the myriad challenges, and the government’s failure to address them adequately in the past, it is important to stay and help the island rebuild.Dayani Centeno Torres, a communications professional and native Puerto Rican, has been working with local nonprofits in the town of Humacao, which was hit hard by the storm. She said she doesn’t judge anyone who wants to move — the current conditions are tough for vulnerable groups like senior citizens and small children. But Centeno Torres and her husband, an attorney, want to help make sure the island rebuilds with a more sustainable, cooperative future in mind.“There’s a lot of injustice, a lot of poor people ― a lot of things that were not caused by the hurricanes, but by a system that didn’t work,” she told HuffPost. “It shouldn’t be rebuilt in the same way.”Centeno Torres has been working with local groups providing emergency relief, such as distributing canned food and water. She’s also been organizing workshops that focus on long-term recovery, such as how to construct houses with solar panels and how to form a community food bank. “Puerto Ricans are not waiting for others to come fix this ― they’re stepping up every day, going outside their doors with saws, cutting trees out of the roads,” said Ward Osborne, a Louisiana-born consultant who has been living in Puerto Rico with his ex-wife and two children for the past five years.Osborne and his family left the island in the first days after the storm, but plan to return around January, once he can rely on computer service to work.“Puerto Rico is very community-oriented, and our neighborhood is doing the best we can to rebuild,” Ward told HuffPost, calling from Lake Texoma, Texas, where he and his kids have relocated to his parents’ house in the interim. “Every person I know in Puerto Rico is working every day, all day to make it better.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/thousands-puerto-ricans-evacuate-to-mainland-us_n_59e151dae4b03a7be580d5b8,HuffPost,Liberal
74,Puerto Rico Plans To Have The Lights Back On By December -- At The Earliest,Ryan Grenoble,10/16/17,"It’s been almost a month since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, knocking the island’s power grid entirely offline.And it will be at least another two months until most of the U.S. territory sees electric service restored. That’s according to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who said Saturday the government hopes repairs will bring back electricity to 95 percent of the island by Dec. 15.The government’s timeline for fixing the grid calls for 30 percent of the island to be electrified by the end of October, 50 percent by mid-November, and 80 percent by Dec. 1. As of Friday, only 17 percent of Puerto Rico had power.“This is an aggressive agenda, but we cannot be sort of passive in the face of Puerto Rico’s challenges,” Rosselló said. “We are going to need all hands on deck.” The governor added he wanted to set quantifiable goals “so that our people can have clear and established metrics.”Vital services like water purification, hospitals, and communication networks rely on a steady power supply, explaining why the Federal Emergency Management Agency has made repairing the power grid its No. 1 priority.The official death toll from last month’s back-to-back hurricanes ticked up to 48 over the weekend, after three people suffered medical emergencies and were unable to access medical care. And as Vox reports, the real death toll is likely far higher, potentially in the hundreds.“The day-to-day can unravel in an instant,” Julie McNamara, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told HuffPost last month, referring to Puerto Rico’s loss of power. She noted other basic services, like sewage treatment and food preservation, become impossible without electricity, as do more modern needs like credit cards, ATMs, and the internet. For the time being, generators are powering much of the island’s critical infrastructure, making fuel shortages a matter of life and death. A number of solar power providers have rushed to aid the island, including Tesla, which wants to prove solar can be a long-term solution there.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-electricity-hurricane_n_59e4c0cde4b03a7be582269e,HuffPost,Liberal
146,Leading Democrat calls for Puerto Rico water investigation,Kevin Bohn,10/15/17," A leading House Democrat has asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the water situation in Puerto Rico after a published report that people were drinking water taken from a federally designated hazardous-waste site. The request comes a day after  a story from CNN's John Sutter  concerning workers from the Puerto Rican water utility Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados distributing water from a well at the  Dorado Groundwater Contamination Site . The site was listed in 2016 as part of the federal Superfund program for hazardous water cleanup. Many Puerto Ricans have been struggling to find clean drinking water since September 20 after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, home to 3.4 million people. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, wrote a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke asking for the investigation. Thompson, from Mississippi, said he wanted to know whether she was aware Americans there are drinking water from possibly contaminated sources. ""Reports of Puerto Ricans waiting hours to receive potentially contaminated water that could have long-term health consequences is beyond disturbing,"" Thompson said Saturday. ""That it happened on days after EPA warned the people of Puerto Rico to refrain from breaking into Superfund sites to access water suggests a troubling breakdown in coordination among the federal entities playing a role in federal disaster response activities. "" The EPA had told CNN it was planning to do testing on wells around the Dorado site this weekend.  ""While some of these wells are sometimes used to provide drinking water, the EPA is concerned that people could be drinking water that may be contaminated, depending on the well,"" the agency said Friday. ""We are mindful of the paramount job of protecting people's health, balanced with people's basic need for water."" In announcing the addition last year of the Dorado site to the Superfund program, the US Environmental Protection Agency said the area was polluted with industrial chemicals, including tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene, which ""can have serious health impacts including damage to the liver and increasing the risk of cancer,"" according to the EPA. CNN reached out Saturday to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Thompson's request, but didn't receive a reply.  According to Puerto Rican officials, 64% of the commonwealth's homes and businesses had potable water as of Saturday.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/14/politics/puerto-rico-superfund-water-thompson/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjYmfa27Mj6AhUjTDABHf24AXk4hAIQFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw2xafoHCeNI88QgFRkhKDbg,CNN,Liberal
148,Here's what would happen to US politics if Puerto Rico became a state,Ryan Struyk,10/14/17," The devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria has brought the small island off the coast of Florida -- home to 3.4 million American citizens -- into the spotlight. Some critics of the federal government's response have raised concerns that help to the island is lagging because it is a US territory and not a state. (Residents on the island are US citizens.) Puerto Ricans voted for statehood in a low-turnout, nonbinding referendum in June, but the island has repeatedly voted with mixed results on statehood in the past. Congress ultimately has the final say on whether Puerto Rico becomes a state. As  The New York Times reported , the number of Puerto Ricans moving to Florida over the last few weeks -- and the number that could move in the coming months -- could tip the purple state in future elections. But how could Puerto Rico rock the national political stage if it's given full-fledged status as the 51st state in the union? Here's a look at how it would affect Congress and, perhaps, the White House. The US Senate in the balance The Constitution provides that each state gets two seats in the US Senate regardless of population, which means Puerto Rico would take the 101st and 102nd seats in the chamber.  It's likely, though not certain, that the Democratic Party would be favored to win those seats. Puerto Ricans who live in Florida are a strong Democratic group, and more than twice as many Puerto Ricans voted in the Democratic presidential caucuses in 2016 as the Republican presidential primary. Still, the Puerto Rican resident commissioner, the territory's non-voting member of the House, caucuses with Republicans. Two Democratic seats from Puerto Rico would (slightly) tip the balance of the Senate. Republicans currently hold 52 seats; two more Democratic seats would result in a 52-50 balance, allowing the GOP only one vote to spare, having to rely on a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, instead of their current two-vote margin, when Democrats remain united against their legislative priorities. Fork in the road for the US House A  big complicated formula  currently explains how many House seats each state should get, according to the Census Bureau. The process starts by automatically giving each state one seat. Then the method gives each potential seat for each state a unique ""priority value"" based on a formula and the state's population. The state with the highest priority value (California) gets the 51st seat. Then the next highest remaining (Texas) gets the 52nd. The next highest (California again) gets the 53rd. New York gets the 54th. Florida gets the 55th. And so on all the way to the 435th seat. The bottom line is this: With 3.4 million people currently living in Puerto Rico, the island would be entitled to five seats in the US House, according to this formula. (They'd get the 128th, 209th, 294th and 378th seats, in addition to their automatic seat, in case you were wondering.) The five unlucky states that would lose one seat each? Minnesota, California, Texas, Washington and Florida. The size of the US House of Representatives has been capped at 435 voting members by law for over a century. So Congress could add seats to the House for Puerto Rico. (When Alaska and Hawaii became states, the number of voting representatives was briefly increased to 437 before returning back to 435 with the next census.) And then (maybe) reduce the number with the next census. Puerto Rico currently has one, non-voting resident commissioner. Electoral College watch Say goodbye to 270. The number of each state's electoral votes is equal to their number of senators plus their number of representatives. With another two seats in the US Senate for Puerto Rico, the total number of electoral votes in the Electoral College would climb to 540, bumping the magic number for victory in the Electoral College up to 271. (That number could change if Congress would add more seats to the House.) Puerto Rico would likely wind up with seven electoral votes. Minnesota, California, Texas, Washington and Florida -- three of which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- would each lose one, giving Democrats a net gain of four Electoral College votes based on 2016 election results, if Democrats in fact won Puerto Rico. A broad 71% of non-Cuban Latino voters in Florida voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls from the 2016 presidential election.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/14/politics/puerto-rico-state-congress-white-house/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjL-fbA58j6AhUVSDABHW9xCNY40gEQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw3RU7je_qAkGpnKZVX4Q6cD,CNN,Liberal
147,Puerto Rico's death toll from Hurricane Maria climbs to 48,Natalie Gallón and Joe Sterling,10/14/17," The death toll from Hurricane Maria has risen to 48 in Puerto Rico, the territory's Department of Public Safety said Saturday. Puerto Ricans still face a daily struggle for food, water and other necessities while coping with the devastation to their homes and businesses more than three weeks after the powerful hurricane slammed ashore on the US commonwealth. Among the recent deaths was a patient unable to get to dialysis treatment on time, and another person complaining of chest pains died after bad road conditions delayed a trip to the hospital, the department said.  The number of deaths may rise, with about 117 people unaccounted for after last month's hurricane. Tens of thousands have fled Puerto Rico since Maria hit September 20. But for many of the millions remaining, the hunt for basic necessities is never-ending.  More than 1.2 million people are without potable water. Some people line up daily to fill up buckets with water from tank trucks, while others collect water from mountain streams. One of those people is Adrian Santiago, who lives near Naranjito, a mountain town in central Purto Rico. Santiago is unemployed after the storm so he collects water and sells it to his neighbors. They use it for showers, washing clothes and cleaning. It's not fit to drink. Much restoration to be done Power outrages are widespread. Nearly 85% of the island lacks electricity, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. The government has prioritized getting the power back on in hospitals and other important facilities, Gov. Richard Rossello said Saturday. Many communities remain cut off, with roads blocked and no phone service. About 19,000 civilian and military personnel are supporting the federal relief mission, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  The Army Corps of Engineers is installing power generators and temporary roofs to damaged structures.  FEMA approved a $70 million assistance package for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority for emergency repairs. Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan promised additional funding for Puerto Rico's long-term rebuilding and said Congress was committed to the island for the ""long haul."" Ryan surveyed storm-ravaged parts of the island from a helicopter one day after the House of Representatives approved a $36.5 billion disaster aid package for victims in Puerto Rico as well as resources for those in Texas, Florida and the US Virgin Islands still recovering from Hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey. ""This isn't the last aid package,"" Ryan told reporters in San Juan. ""This is the second in more to come. ... When we get that final analysis, the administration will submit yet again to Congress a request for another aid package to respond to these longer-term problems.""",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/14/us/puerto-rico-recovery/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWvqeq5sj6AhU2ZDABHdJ_Aks4yAEQFnoECAgQAg&usg=AOvVaw1rO-zRx-R4Mn-Rf9OZc7sV,CNN,Liberal
151,Trump seems ready to pull aid from Puerto Rico. He took a different tone with Texas and Florida.,Dan Merica,10/12/17," President Donald Trump said Thursday morning that the United States cannot aid hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico ""forever,"" offering the island territory a dramatically different level of commitment than he extended Texas and Florida after hurricanes rocked each of those states. Thursday's Twitter messages from Trump compound previous statements saying the US territory has not done enough for itself during clean-up efforts and Twitter fights with Puerto Rican officials, such as San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz‏. ""Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend,"" Trump tweeted Thursday. ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!"" Puerto Rico remains in crisis conditions after Hurricane Maria made landfall late last month. Nearly three weeks after the hurricane hit, 83% of Puerto Rico is without power, according to the Puerto Rican government, much of the 3.4 million-person island is without clean water, and the death toll has jumped to 45 with at least 113 people unaccounted for. The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that residents on the island have reportedly been trying to obtain water from Superfund sites -- bodies of water contaminated by hazardous waste.  But while Trump visited San Juan last week, Trump's response to Puerto Rico stands in contrast to what he tweeted after visiting Houston, a city that was left powerless and flooded by Hurricane Harvey. ""TEXAS: We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, and REBUILD,"" he wrote. Trump extended the same message to Florida after Hurricane Irma hit the state. ""Just like TX, WE are w/you today, we are w/you tomorrow, & we will be w/you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to RESTORE, RECOVER, & REBUILD,"" he wrote. Trump has been accused ever since Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico of demeaning the island's efforts to rebuild and recover. In a series of tweets attacking the mayor of San Juan, Trump accused the leadership in Puerto Rico of wanting ""everything to be done for them."" ""Such poor leadership ability by the mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,"" he wrote over two tweets. ""They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort."" Yulín Cruz‏ responded to Trump's Thursday morning tweets by calling him the ""Hater in Chief."" Trump has also compared Puerto Rico to Texas and Florida, noting that the island territory -- which was already dealing with a debt crisis before the hurricane hit -- had an aging infrastructure and power system. ""Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,"" he wrote. ""It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated."" Puerto Rico's debt has loomed large over the Trump administration's response to the island. Trump said with a grin during his visit to the island that paying for the recovery has ""thrown our budget a little out of whack."" After Trump's tweets on Thursday morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders reaffirmed the administration's commitment to the island but said that recoveries -- like the one ongoing in Puerto Rico -- cannot last forever. ""We continue to do so with the full force of the US government and its resources in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and other affected areas,"" she said. ""Successful recoveries do not last forever; they should be as swift as possible to help people resume their normal lives."" She added: ""We are committed to helping Puerto Rico. Our administration is working with Gov. (Ricardo) Rossello and Congress to identify the best fiscally responsible path forward."" White House chief of staff John Kelly, speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, said Trump's tweet about the United States military and FEMA was ""exactly accurate"" because all first responders want to ""work yourself out of a job.""  ""The minute you go anywhere as a first responder, and this would apply certainly to the military, you will try really hard to work yourself out of a job,"" he said. ""There will be a period in which we hope sooner rather than later, the US military and FEMA, generally speaking can withdraw because then the government and people of Puerto Rico are recovering sufficiently to start the process of rebuilding.""  Kelly added that the tweet was ""exactly accurate"" because ""they are not going to be there forever.""

149,"3 weeks after Maria, Puerto Rico's pain is unending",Ray Sanchez and AJ Willingham,10/12/17," The 80-year-old woman's suicide note was ready when the volunteer nurses knocked on her door in the northern coastal town of Rio Grande. She'd had enough.       ""Her caretaker was abusing her,"" Bita Mehrjou, a New York-based nurse assisting with relief efforts in Puerto Rico, said Thursday. ""She was alone. There was little food and water. The situation wasn't getting better. She wanted out. She tried taking all her pills.""     It's been three weeks since Hurricane Maria plowed across the island. Since then, Puerto Rico's 3.4 million American citizens have been plagued with power outages and a dangerous shortage of drinking water. More than a hundred people remain unaccounted for. Animal corpses rot in stagnant water, providing a breeding ground for infection and disease.  Over all of it, the shadow of debt looms. The estimated cost of Maria's damage is $95 billion -- almost an entire year's economic output for the island. For many, desperation has taken over. Mehrjou, traveling across the island since last week with more than 20 American Federation of Teachers nurses and health professionals, said the elderly woman who contemplated suicide was rushed to a hospital after the nurses alerted the town's mayor.  In a phone interview, Mehrjou said her team also came across a woman trapped on the sixth floor of an assisted living facility. She had not eaten in three days. They met an elderly woman with a gangrenous foot. She was bedridden and dehydrated. Her heart rate was in the 180s. Her family could not get her an ambulance.  The nurses met a colon cancer patient who had been unable to receive chemotherapy for three weeks, Mehrjou said. One family lacked the psychiatric drugs needed to control the violent behavior of a 30-year-old relative. So they kept him locked in a hot room.         ""People are scared,"" she said. ""They're not sure what to do.""  Trump: Sending aid too burdensome As Puerto Ricans continue to struggle to find basic necessities, President Donald Trump criticized the island's dated infrastructure and implied that sending aid there was becoming too burdensome.  Puerto Rico's unbelievably slow recovery in 2 depressing charts ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!""  Trump tweeted . San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has feuded publicly with the President over the federal response to Maria, said his ""actions are unbecoming of a leader of the free world."" ""Your tweets and comments just show desperation and underscore the inadequacy of your government's response to this humanitarian crisis,"" she said in a statement. ""It is not that you do not get it. It is that you are incapable of empathy and frankly, simply cannot get the job done.""  So how is Puerto Rico faring? If the federal government pulls resources from the US territory, is the island ready to move on without aid?  The short answer is, absolutely not.  ""Everybody that we're seeing is quite desperate and desperate in a different way,"" said Andrea Gentile, an Oregon-based nurse practitioner traveling with the AFT group.   ""We saw an elderly woman who was being cared for by her nearly equally elderly daughter. The woman was in her early 90s, her daughter in her 70s. And this little woman grabs my hand, looks me in the eye and says, 'I am just terrified and all I can do is cry.' Everywhere we turn there is an equally desperate story.""   How bad is it?  So far, Maria has claimed the lives of 45 people in Puerto Rico,  and that number may climb , as 117 others remain unaccounted for. ""You can expect that most of those missing people are dead,"" said John Mutter, a Columbia University disaster specialist who studied the death toll after Hurricane Katrina.  Mutter believes the number of dead in Puerto Rico is considerably higher. ""It's just seems implausible that it could be so low,"" he said.   Some 83% of Puerto Ricans have no power. That means no internet, no way to get cell phones working, and limited means to communicate or get information.  The drinking water situation  is particularly dire . Thirty-six percent of Puerto Ricans are without potable water. That's more than 1.2 million people who are struggling to find a most critical resource. The situation is so bad that the US Environmental Protection Agency recently revealed some desperate citizens are trying to break into wells at hazardous wastes sites just to get water, even though the water there is unsafe to drink.  Waterways on the island provide no safe relief. Raw sewage continues to spill into rivers and streams. Urine and fluids from animals, dead and alive, mix with chemicals and human sewage, meaning the water isn't just dangerous for drinking. It's dangerous to be around at all. How bad can it get?  The water shortages and power outages aren't independent problems. Until both are solved, residents of the island will be in very real danger.  Already two people have died of leptospirosis, which spreads when the urine of infected animals gets into drinking water. This public health threat won't be fully mitigated, the EPA says, until waterways and infrastructure are repaired and power is restored.  If boiling water to make it safe for drinking is not possible, the EPA has recommended disinfecting it with bleach. What is the government doing?  Today,  the House approved a $36.5 billion disaster aid package  for Puerto Rico. This includes almost $5 billion in potential loans and almost $19 billion for FEMA's depleted Disaster Relief Fund.   According to FEMA, 19,000 civilian and military personnel are supporting the federal relief mission.  This week,  FEMA also approved a $70 million assistance package  for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority for emergency repairs.  How you can help There are several ways.

150,Trump: We cannot aid Puerto Rico 'forever',Daniella Diaz,10/12/17," President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that Puerto Rico is going to have to shoulder more responsibility for recovery efforts from Hurricane Maria, saying the federal government's emergency responders can't stay there ""forever."" His comments -- in which he also blamed the beleaguered island for a financial crisis ""largely of their own making"" and infrastructure that was a ""disaster"" before the hurricane -- come as Puerto Rico still reels from a lack of electricity, public health access and a rising death toll. The remarks quickly prompted cries from Democratic lawmakers, who argue that Puerto Rico still needs a lot of help, as well as the mayor of San Juan, who said they were ""unbecoming"" and appeared to come from a ""hater in chief."" Meanwhile, Texas and Florida -- two states Trump won during last year's presidential election -- also were struck by severe hurricanes recently, but the President has made no public indication that the federal government is pulling back on its response there. The President wrote in two separate tweets, ""'Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.' says Sharyl Attkisson. A total lack of........accountability say the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend..."" He continued in a third tweet: ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!"" Attkisson is a journalist who works for conservative Sinclair Broadcasting. White House chief of staff John Kelly said at the White House briefing Thursday that Trump's tweet was ""exactly accurate"" because first responders ""are not going to be there forever."" ""The minute you go anywhere as a first responder, and this would apply certainly to the military, you will try really hard to work yourself out of a job,"" he said. ""There will be a period in which we hope sooner rather than later, the US military and (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), generally speaking, can withdraw because then the government and people of Puerto Rico are recovering sufficiently to start the process of rebuilding."" A FEMA official told CNN the agency has ""no hard deadline"" on when it plans to pull resources from the island. ""It all will be determined by the conditions on the ground,"" the official said. The official said once things are ""stabilized"" in Puerto Rico, FEMA will ""pull back resources as appropriate,"" adding that's the ""natural progression of a response to a disaster."" FEMA's focus, the official said, is to ""move from the response phase to recovery,"" adding the recovery phase often takes years.  Dire situation Trump's tweets come  three weeks after the hurricane  first struck the island, which remains largely without power. The death toll from the storm has risen to 45, authorities have said, and at least 113 people remain unaccounted for, according to Karixia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety. Paul Ryan leading bipartisan delegation to Puerto Rico on Friday The recovery has moved slowly since Maria struck the US territory on September 20, leaving most of the island without basic services such as power and running water, according to residents, relief workers and local elected officials. Hospitals throughout the cash-strapped island of 3.4 million people have been running low on medicine and fuel, and residents and local elected officials have said they expect the death toll to rise. The water situation is so dire, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a news release Wednesday, that residents on the island have reportedly been trying to obtain water from Superfund sites -- which are bodies of water contaminated by hazardous waste. The EPA advised against ""tampering with sealed and locked wells or drinking from these wells, as it may be dangerous to people's health."" Administration officials sought to downplay Trump's comments Thursday morning. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, testifying before the House financial services committee, said that he has ""no intention"" of abandoning recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. ""They're a very important part of who we are,"" he said, later adding: ""(Puerto Rico) should not be abandoned."" And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders reaffirmed federal support to the island. ""Our job in any disaster affected location is to help the community respond and recover from that disaster. We continue to do so with the full force of the US government and its resources in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and other affected areas,"" she said. ""Successful recoveries do not last forever; they should be as swift as possible to help people resume their normal lives."" Democrats, however, pounced on Trump's tweets. ""Puerto Ricans are Americans, and we don't abandon each other. The federal government should stay in Puerto Rico as long as necessary,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California,  tweeted . Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren  tweeted,  ""Puerto Rico is still facing a humanitarian crisis. @realDonaldTrump seems more worried about blaming hurricane victims than helping them."" And San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has feuded publicly with the President over the federal response,  said on Twitter  that Trump was incapable of fulfilling the moral imperative to help the people of PR. Shame on you.!"" Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said in a news conference Thursday that he called the White House looking for clarification on Trump's tweets. ""The law establishes that the aid we are getting from FEMA has to be established for the duration of emergency efforts,"" he said. 'It's not a decision as is, it's a law that all the resources must be available for Puerto Rico."" However Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, who is a member of the House foreign affairs committee, told CNN's Chris Cuomo Thursday there's only ""so much"" the US can do to help Puerto Rico. ""I would then again say, 'What is enough?' What is the right amount to satisfy whoever says we're not doing enough,"" he said on ""New Day."" ""It's regrettable and it's sad for those people but there only is physically, humanly possible so much that any nation could do in the wake of devastation."" He continued: ""I lived through it myself, a victim of floods on numerous occasions, had to clean it up, and I will tell you, nobody came to help us, we handled it ourselves."" House to vote on disaster relief Acting Department of Homeland Security Elaine Duke will make her second trip to the island on Thursday. House Speaker Paul Ryan  will lead a bipartisan delegation  visiting Puerto Rico on Friday, according to the speaker's office. Ryan will travel to the island with House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey and Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the panel. Puerto Rico's sole representative in Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, and House GOP Conference Chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers also will be part of the congressional delegation. The House of Representatives approved a $36.5 billion disaster aid package Thursday to help victims struggling to recover from a string of devastating hurricanes and wildfires. The measure now heads to the Senate, which returns from a weeklong recess next week.

76,These Volunteer Nurses In Puerto Rico Fear FEMA Is Failing,Jennifer Bendery,10/12/17,"WASHINGTON ― Water is rationed. Scabies is spreading. Grocery stores are lined with empty shelves, if they’re open at all. People are fainting as they wait in lines for hours in sweltering heat, because they have to check into a FEMA hub to get small amounts of food and supplies being guarded by armed officers. That’s if they can even make it to FEMA.This is the jarring reality that greeted registered nurses Alicia Schwartz and Misty Richards when they arrived in Puerto Rico. They didn’t know each other before last week, when they flew into San Juan from New York and Oregon, respectively, to volunteer to help with the humanitarian crisis on the island ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Now they spend every night together, camped out in a vacated baseball stadium locker room with other volunteers trying to aid 3.4 million fellow Americans in their moment of need.FEMA and military personnel have been leading relief efforts, but from the looks of it, something isn’t working. It’s been more than three weeks since the hurricane hit, and 36 percent of people still don’t have drinking water, according to a government website updated daily. About 84 percent still don’t have power.And that’s if you think the data are accurate. In a phone interview, Schwartz and Richards laughed as HuffPost read aloud statistics from the government site. They say it’s way worse.“That’s lies,” said Schwartz, 54. “First of all, we don’t even know if the water is drinkable. Where is FEMA collecting this information? This is not what we’re seeing.”Schwartz said she’s met people who haven’t had much access to drinking water for weeks, so they keep filling up containers from rivers or mountain streams. But that water isn’t clean and can cause bacterial diseases, including leptospirosis, which is spread by animal urine. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Wednesday that at least 10 people have suspected cases of leptospirosis, and four deaths may be tied to it.“Who tells them that they cannot drink this water?” asked Schwartz. “We had to stop people on the side of the road to Utuado, one of the places where water rushes by, and stop people from getting water there and teach them how to disinfect water.”Richards, 47, said the idea that 86 percent of grocery stores are open, another statistic on the government website, seems off. In the towns she’s visited all over the island, most markets are closed or in dire conditions. She and Schwartz have spent time in about 20 towns so far, including Humacao, Fajardo, Utuado, Rio Grande and the outskirts of San Juan.“There are long lines and empty shelves. I have met tons of people with pictures of empty shelves,” Richards said. “There is no meat to be had. Very limited amounts of dairy. That’s even in San Juan, where people are better off in an urban area.”Neither of the nurses claims to have a full understanding of FEMA’s operations. They’ve been on the island for just over a week. They have next to no internet service, and they aren’t in regular contact with government officials. They just know what they’re seeing, and it’s nothing like President Donald Trump’s picture of a successful recovery effort.Richards and Schwartz hadn’t even planned to come to Puerto Rico. Both spontaneously decided to do so when their union under the American Federation of Teachers issued a call to members earlier this month to volunteer. AFT, which has a health division, teamed up with the AFL-CIO to mobilize more than 300 members to the island. Most volunteers are using up vacation days to help.A Typical DayEvery morning, they pile into trucks with other medical professionals and make their way into towns to see if, and how badly, someone needs medical attention. Richards said most of her patients are people who are too sick or weak to leave their homes. She said her team brings some medicine and supplies for the people they meet, but she worries about the high numbers of people she’s met with hypertension and diabetes.“They’re being poorly controlled due to access to medication and access to proper food,” Richards said. “Think about it: All you have is processed food. You’re diabetic or have high blood pressure. The health conditions they have are exacerbated.”Schwartz, who grew up in Puerto Rico but moved to New York when she was 21, said she’s seen a lot of cases of conjunctivitis, better known as pink eye, and scabies, a contagious skin infestation. Scabies is already difficult to treat; it requires thoroughly cleaning all sheets and clothing. But here, where people don’t have much access to clean water, Schwartz said it will be particularly tough to stop its spread.Both nurses are meeting with people who are living in squalor. In one coastal village, Schwartz said she met an older woman who had fungus growing on her arms and back. It was from sleeping on a wet mattress, still soaked in seawater from when the hurricane lashed the area weeks ago. In another town, Humacao, she visited two elderly people living in a house with no door and no roof over the living room. The windows were blown out, and the house smelled like mold.“Even the doctor that was with us, he cried. Lightning was beginning, and you could tell they were going to get wet,” said Schwartz. “They don’t have any place to go.”There’s also an absurd element. FEMA put up signs telling people to call them or sign up online for help. But most people have no electricity or cell service.“There’s been a flipping hurricane. There’s FEMA posters everywhere that say, ‘Call FEMA. Apply to FEMA online,’” said Richards. “It’s laughable. But it’s not.”The nurses convey a level of urgency that echoes San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who has been begging for more help from the government and has criticized the Trump administration’s response to the disaster. Trump has dismissed her as “weak,” and FEMA Director Brock Long has followed his lead, saying that he “filtered out the mayor a long time ago” and that FEMA “is making progress every day in conjunction with the governor.”But there is clearly a disconnect between what the government is saying and what people on the ground are seeing. Beyond the government’s statistics about water or electricity, the death count numbers don’t seem to add up. The governor said Wednesday that the death toll has hit 45. But disaster experts say that seems low given the grave conditions, and Vox did its own investigation and found at least 450 reported deaths since the hurricane hit.A request for comment from the Puerto Rico governor’s office about how officials collect data on water and power, and on the accuracy of the death toll, since the hurricane was not returned.“The Beach Is Hungry. La Playa Tiene Hambre.”Richards and Schwartz say locals are coming up with ways to survive on their own. They’ve seen people running cars for 20 hours a day as an energy source, rigging lines from the car battery into their homes. They met a woman who has been taking her granddaughter to a liquor store twice a day because a friend there lets her use their generator to power a nebulizer that she needs in order to breathe. Some people have told them they’ve waited in line for hours for food from government workers and then walked away with just snacks. Yet locals offer the nurses what little food they have when they arrive to help them.“We pull out our tables and set up a triage area, and they come out with food. They cook for us. They have their pride, and they want us to eat something. But I couldn’t,” said Schwartz. “In Humacao, I kept looking at a sign that says, ‘The Beach Is Hungry. La Playa Tiene Hambre.’ They put the sign up after the hurricane, so people would know they’re hungry and people would do something.”Asked what they think is the most important thing the government could do right now to improve conditions, they said FEMA workers should be going to people’s homes and bringing aid to them ― not requiring people to come to them at a hub that many can’t get to. They said they’ve had to push hard to get supplies from FEMA to distribute, and if they get any it’s not nearly enough. They fear water shortages will take their toll.“As a nurse, we talk about people needing to drink a gallon of water a day. In this heat, if there’s no A/C because of no electricity, we’re asking you to drink more water,” said Richards. “I have not seen yet people sick from waterborne illness, but we expect that to come as bottled water runs out. You would think they wouldn’t run out, but there is tight control of the water supply by FEMA. Water has been rationed.”What Is FEMA Doing?HuffPost reached out to FEMA’s Puerto Rico office to ask why it is requiring hurricane victims to go to a hub for help, versus sending workers to people’s homes, and why FEMA is telling people to call or go online for help when people don’t have power or cell service.A FEMA spokesman, who would only speak on condition of anonymity, said there are 10 staging areas set up on the island for local officials to pick up supplies for their communities. If people can’t get to the stations, the spokesman said, FEMA teams are visiting towns and providing “support in delivering supplies” to those areas by air or by ground.The spokesman also listed off statistics: As of Oct. 11, FEMA has distributed 7.6 million meals and 6.4 million liters of water, and it has received roughly 455,000 registrations for federal assistance from survivors. That’s just one-seventh of the island’s population that’s been able to register for help in three weeks.As for why FEMA is telling people to call or go online, the spokesman said, “We encourage those impacted by Hurricane Maria with phone and/or internet connectivity to register for disaster assistance. … Those with limited internet and phone access should get in touch with their local officials so they can work with our FEMA liaisons to offer registration services.”Neither of the nurses knows when she will head back home, but at some point they can’t afford to miss work anymore. They already feel sick about what they’ll be leaving behind when they go, if nothing changes.“These people are going to have an epidemic. These people are going to die. A lot of them are,” said Schwartz. “The help is not really there for them.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-fema-trump_n_59df75d5e4b00abf3646c751,HuffPost,Liberal
75,Trump Threatens To Yank FEMA Responders From Hurricane-Ravaged Puerto Rico,Hayley Miller,10/12/17,"PresidentDonald Trump on Thursday threatened to withdraw federal aid from Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory continues struggling to recover from back-to-back hurricanes.In a series of tweets, Trump quoted conservative journalist and frequent Fox News guest Sharyl Attkison blaming Puerto Rico for its festering financial crisis and suggested Federal Emergency Management Agency aid could soon end.“Congress to decide how much to spend,” Trump tweeted. “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”Puerto Rican officials have pleaded with the government for more help after the island was pounded by major hurricanes Irma and Maria last month. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, among others, has harshly criticized the Trump administration response.Cruz responded to Trump’s Thursday tweets with a fresh blast, calling him a “hater-in-chief.”The House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a disaster relief bill that includes a $4.9 billion loan for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Puerto Rican governor estimates $95 billion in damage.Roughly 83 percent of the island remained without power and more than one-third was without access to drinking water. Impassable roads blocked rescue and recovery crews from remote areas. More than 5,600 people were still living in shelters, according to a government website tracking Puerto Rico’s recovery.FEMA officials told The Guardian the government and its partners provide 200,000 meals a day, but millions of people are in need of aid.Last week, Trump announced a vague plan to “wipe” away the Puerto Rican government’s $73 billion debt. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney attempted to walk back the president’s comments.Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly praised himself and his administration for what he claims is a job well done. He visited the island last week, tossing rolls of paper towels at storm victims and complaining that the island’s crisis had “thrown our budget a little out of whack.”This article has been updated to include the San Juan mayor’s response and the latest recovery statistics.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-fema_n_59df4de8e4b00abf36469922,HuffPost,Liberal
152,Puerto Rico's hurricane death toll rises to 45,Ray Sanchez,10/11/17," Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico, the vast majority of the island remains without power and the death toll from the storm has risen to 45, authorities said. At least 113 people remain unaccounted for, according to Karixia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety. The recovery has moved slowly since Maria struck the US territory on September 20, leaving most of the island without basic services such as power and running water, according to residents, relief workers and local elected officials.  Acting US Department of Homeland Security Elaine Duke will make her second trip to the island on Thursday, DHS spokesman David Lapan said Wednesday.  The visit comes as hospitals throughout the cash-strapped island of 3.4 million people have been running low on medicine and fuel. Some residents and local elected officials have said they expect the death toll to rise.  In the town of Caguas, in the central mountain range, some patients -- including one breathing with the aid of a ventilator -- had to be  evacuated to the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort near San Juan after a generator failed, Dr. Christian Rodriguez said this week.  At least two people have died from leptospirosis, which spreads when the urine of infected animals gets into drinking water, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz told CNN Wednesday. People have been drinking water from creeks contaminated by dead animals, she said.  ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" she said. ""We are now starting to see a lot of health issues. ... So we are in a great effort, a great humanitarian effort."" As of Wednesday 89% of the island was without electricity and almost 47% had no phone service,  according to a website  set up by the Puerto Rican government. Some 43% of the island's 313 bank branches remained closed, it said. ""We are making progress,"" Chris Krebs, Homeland Security's assistant secretary for infrastructure protection, said Wednesday. ""There's progress on the power side. But we can do more. We can push more resources down into the island."" The recovery will take time given the storm's magnitude, he said ""We are pushing everything we can down into Puerto Rico,"" Krebs said.  ""There are over 17,000 responders, whether it's military or civilian assets. Over 100 helicopters doing air drops in remote communities, providing water. Each of the 78 municipalities has a dedicated water truck. Another 72 trucks are dedicated to hospitals and other critical services. ... Over 50 generators have been installed in critical facilities not just heath care but also now moving into other facilities like schools.""  In the mountainous town of Añasco on the western coast, Lucelenia Rivera said she has been running a generator to keep her medications refrigerated but diesel fuel is in short supply. She suffers from asthma and arthritis, takes medication for her blood pressure and worries that recurring mudslides will further isolate her community.   ""I'm going crazy trying to get out of here because of my physical condition,"" she said. ""But this is all I have. I don't have money or another home. This is it."" At least five of those who are missing lived in the northern coastal town of Arecibo, where residents have been lining up for hours to buy ice and fuel. Some arrive as early as 1 a.m. at ice plants that won't open for another six hours for a chance to buy a single bag of ice at a 20% markup, according to residents. Kelly Lopez cried while saying she was denied an extra bag of ice for her sister, who is epileptic and bedridden.  ""This is so hard on all Puerto Ricans,"" she said. For weeks, island residents have been queuing up in seemingly interminable lines for their basic needs -- from food to cash.  Abisain Medina said he drove 30 minutes to Arecibo to stand in line at a bank for five hours before the bank's computer's crashed.  Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, citing an ""unprecedented catastrophe,""  has lobbied Capitol Hill for a significant new influx of money  soon as the island perches on the brink of ""a massive liquidity crisis,"" according to a letter obtained by CNN.  In a three-page letter sent to congressional leaders, Rosselló is requesting more than $4 billion from various agencies and loan programs to ""meet the immediate emergency needs of Puerto Rico."" The Trump administration submitted a $29 billion disaster-relief request to Congress last week to fund recovery efforts in the wake of hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma and to pay federal flood insurance claims. The House is expected to vote on that measure as soon as this week. Rosselló also pointed to a potential exodus of the island's inhabitants should aid not be available in a timely manner -- something he has also emphasized in conversations with lawmakers. Over 400,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to the mainland United States since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center. Puerto Rico now has 3.4 million residents. Many left because Puerto Rico suffers from high unemployment, rising taxes and few job opportunities outside of tourism. Clarification: A previous version of this story may have given the impression that Karixia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, said the death toll was expected to rise. Ortiz did not make that statement to CNN. CNN's Nick Valencia, Matthew Friedman, Leyla Santiago and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.

78,"Puerto Rico Governor Asks Congress For More Aid, Citing $95 Billion In Damages",Carolina Moreno,10/10/17,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has asked Congress for more than $4 billion in federal relief aid following Hurricane Maria, in a letter dated on Saturday. Rossellóshared the three-page letter he sent to congressional leaders, anda similar letter he wrote to President Donald Trump, via Twitter on Monday. “Puerto Rico has suffered an unprecedented catastrophe that has largely destroyed our physical infrastructure, including our electrical and telecommunications systems, impaired our public health facilities, and gravely limited the ability of our central and municipal governments to meet basic human needs,” Rosselló wrote.He said that destruction caused by the hurricane nearly three weeks ago “led to independent damage assessments in the range of $95 billion” on the island where about 3.4 million people live. “Financial damages of this magnitude will subject Puerto Rico’s central government, its instrumentalities, and municipal governments to unsustainable cash shortfalls,” Rosselló said. “As a result, in addition to the immediate humanitarian crisis, Puerto Rico is on the brink of a massive liquidity crisis that will intensify in the immediate future.”Rosselló thanked the federal government for the assistance it’s provided so far, but stressed that without “extraordinary measures to address the halt in economic activity in Puerto Rico, the humanitarian crisis will deepen.” He also warned that the demise of the island’s economy would lead to a mass exodus to the U.S. mainland.This week, the House is expected to consider the Trump administration’s request for a $29 billion aid package to assist states and U.S. territories that have been struck by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and recent wildfires.Rosselló on Monday also told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud that he wants the federal government to, once again, waive the Jones Act. The 1920 act imposes steep shipping costs on the U.S. territory and was waived for 10 days so the island could import aid at a lower cost. The waiver ended on Sunday night and Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost “it is not being extended at this time.”“I think we should have all the tools that we have at hand,” Rosselló told Begnaud in an Instagram video on Monday night. “In this emergency phase when we are looking to sustain and save lives — we should have all the assets at hand.”As of Tuesday morning, 84 percent of the island was without power, more than 67 percent of cell towers were not working and just over 36 percent of residents did not have access to drinking water.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
77,Mark Zuckerberg Responds To Backlash Over Puerto Rico Virtual Reality Video,Carolina Moreno,10/10/17,"Mark Zuckerberg isunder fire this week for livestreaming avirtual reality tour of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.Avatars of the Facebook CEO and the company’s head of social VR Rachel Franklin appeared Monday in a virtual reality video of the hurricane-ravaged island posted to the social network. The video doubled as a demo of the Facebook Spaces app and as a platform to announce the company’s initiative with the Red Cross during natural disasters.Critics called the move “disaster tourism” and accused the company of using the suffering of the U.S. territory for promotion.Zuckerberg responded to the backlash on Tuesday, in a statement Facebook gave to HuffPost: One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what’s happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn’t clear, and I’m sorry to anyone this offended.Zuckerberg also posted his statement below the livestream, where many had voiced their outrage.Other critics expressed their discontent via Twitter. In the video, avatar versions of Zuckerberg and Franklin “teleport” into a 360-degree video NPR shot of the ravaged island.“We’re on a bridge here, it’s flooded,” Zuckerberg says during the video. “You can get a sense of some of the damage here that the hurricanes have done. One of the things that’s really magical about virtual reality is you can get the feeling that you’re really in a place.”At one point, the two Facebook leaders high-five in the middle of a flooded street to show they are both in separate locations in the real world but interacting in a virtual world. “You know, we’re looking around and it feels like we’re really here in Puerto Rico,” Zuckerberg later reiterates. “It’s obviously a tough place to get to now and a lot of people are really suffering with the aftermath of the hurricanes.”As of Tuesday afternoon, the video had more than 1.7 million views.During the livestream, Zuckerberg also touted what Facebook had done in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria ― including sending employees to the island to get telecommunications systems up and running. After emphasizing the importance of having internet access after a disaster, the CEO announced a partnership with the Red Cross to restore connectivity in communities like the ones suffering in Puerto Rico. “We build artificial intelligence to build what we call population maps, so you can look at satellite imagery of an area and get a sense of where it is that people actually live and the density of different places and were there’s infrastructure going to those places,” he explained during the video. “That’s going to help the Red Cross figure out where people are who need help and figure out how to connect them with them.”Only 53 percent of telecommunications services in Puerto Rico were functioning as of Tuesday afternoon, nearly three weeks after Hurricane Maria slammed into the island.

79,"In Puerto Rico, Lives Depend On Volunteer Doctors And Diesel Generators","Robin Respaut, Nick Brown",10/9/17,"OROCOVIS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - At a community center in Orocovis, an isolated agricultural town of 23,000 in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, six oxygen-dependent patients drew breath with the help of the diesel generator powering their equipment.Then the generator sputtered as if it might die.A dozen volunteer doctors and medical students from San Juan started assessing which patient should be transported first - in the town’s only ambulance - to a hospital an hour away, and which could survive without oxygen for a short time.Javier Sevilla Rodriguez, a medical student, had only one way to make the agonizing decisions. He removed one woman’s oxygen tube, watching carefully to see how her blood-oxygen level responded.“This is how we are doing triage right now,” he said.Two weeks after hurricane Maria, many of Puerto Rico’s sick, frail and elderly are teetering on the edge, one faulty generator away from missing dialysis treatments or having critical medications go bad.With nearly the entire island still lacking electricity, hospitals, clinics, and shelters are operating on aging generators not intended for long-term use and powered by scarce diesel fuel. Water is still not available for nearly half the population and supplies of medicines and oxygen are running low.And residents still can’t call for help across vast swaths of the island because of widespread cellular network outages.Many regions in the interior of the island, like this one, are only now seeing relief efforts, amid a plodding U.S. disaster response to this island of 3.4 million American citizens. The U.S. territory’s battered economy and infrastructure has magnified the humanitarian crisis wrought by the strongest hurricane to hit here in nine decades.In Orocovis, even the sickest patients have gone largely without medical care since the storm. So the doctors worked quickly throughout the day, conferring with caregivers and writing prescriptions they would take back to San Juan to fill and then dispatch by messenger.Now at the community center, their last stop before leaving town, time ran out.With a loud clunk, the sounds of humming oxygen machines stopped and were replaced by a chorus of beeps and chirps warning that power had been cut.The generator had failed.A CALL FOR DOCTORSThe medical convoy that visited Orocovis is an entirely volunteer operation, organized by physician Carlos Mellado. After Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, blocking roads and crippling power and communications networks, Mellado asked other doctors at his clinic to cover for him and threw himself into hurricane relief work.On the first day, he headed to Canovanas, east of the capital, checking on people at shelters. He promised to fill many patients’ prescriptions and send back the medications.The next day, he went to Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico’s eastern coast, and found diabetics without insulin, heart patients under extreme stress and crucial treatments interrupted by power outages.When Mellado returned to San Juan, he stopped by the local radio station, which in the days after the storm, had become a trusted source of information for Puerto Ricans living without communications. Invited to speak to listeners, he called for other physicians willing to join him.Now, Mellado has a core group of 18 physicians, who rotate between the trips and their own practices, and a growing list of more doctors who want to join. Each morning, he takes out a paper map of the island covered with notes about where he’s been. The doctors pick a town and go.The convoys have no official ties, but Mellado reports each evening on what the doctors found to Puerto Rican and federal officials in San Juan. Sometimes Puerto Rico’s housing department coordinates deliveries of the drugs back to the towns, and a pharmacy chain donates medications for patients without insurance.The government’s death count from the storm more than doubled this week to 36. But doctors across the island believe the total would be far higher if it included people with chronic conditions who died because they lacked access to medical care.“For these critically ill patients, if everything fails, they don’t have too much time,” said Humberto Guzman, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon and member of the medical convoy. ”People are dying.”‘WE CANNOT WAIT’In Orocovis, after the generator failed, the doctors looked for a quick fix. Guzman ran up the street to the town’s shuttered urgent care facility.There, he found a half-dozen oxygen tanks that locals said had been delivered the day before. Each could provide about a day’s worth of oxygen to a patient.The tanks were quickly moved to the community center, where the doctors taught family members to use them. But before that became necessary, the generator sprang back to life.The doctors packed up to leave, assuring patients’ families that they could switch to the tanks if the generator failed again.“In every town right now, there are moments like this happening,” Guzman said. “That’s why you need people like us to just go. We cannot wait.” Reporting by Robin Respaut and Nick Brown; Editing by Sue Horton and Brian Thevenot",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-puerto-rico-lives-depend-on-volunteer-doctors-and-diesel-generators_n_59dbd731e4b00377980b0986,HuffPost,Liberal
81,The Jones Act Waiver For Puerto Rico Just Expired And Won't Be Renewed,Jennifer Bendery,10/9/17,"WASHINGTON ― The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and “it is not being extended at this time,” Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.DHS hadtemporarily waived the Jones Act ― an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island ― on Sept. 28. The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.With the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That’s meant that Puerto Ricopays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands ― and that U.S. vessels are making bank.The return to higher shipping costs won’t help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don’t have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven’t heard from loved ones, andat least 39 deathshave been attributed to the storm.Lapan said DHS is “always prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly” to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters.“We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island,” Lapan said. “There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico.”Despite DHS’ position, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Monday night that he wants another extension of the Jones Act waiver.“I think we should have it,” Rossello told CBS News’ David Begnaud. “In this emergency phase, while we’re looking to sustain and save lives, we should have all of the assets at hand.”President Donald Trump, who is spending Monday golfing, had originally hedged on waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico at all, saying “a lot of shippers” didn’t want him to do it. He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).McCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law.“Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,” McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. “Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.”This article has been updated with comment from the Puerto Rican governor on the need for another waiver.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-jones-act_n_59dba977e4b0b34afa5b36e6,HuffPost,Liberal
80,"Puerto Rico's Official Death Toll Hits 39, With The Final Number Still Unknown",Carolina Moreno,10/9/17,"The official number of deaths in Puerto Rico related to Hurricane Maria has now risen from 36 to 39.Héctor M. Pesquera, secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, described the circumstances of the three added deaths during a press conference Sunday afternoon. He said he did not expect the final death toll to reach the hundreds and declined to address media reports of dozens of unaccounted dead.One of the three newly counted deaths occurred in Dorado, 15 miles west of San Juan. The man’s decomposed body was brought to the Institute of Forensic Science in San Juan on Oct. 6. Mud and debris were found in the body’s organs, and it was determined that he had died by drowning in the Plata river during the storm.The other two deaths occurred in San Juan. One person was found under the wooden rubble of a house that had collapsed on Saturday. The other person, who died on Thursday, was thought to be an indirect victim of the storm.“She lost her home and she was depressed,” Pesquera told reporters on Sunday (HuffPost obtained an audio recording from the Department of Public Safety). “She had a strong pain in her chest. When they do the autopsy, we’ll come to the conclusion of the cause of death. However, during interviews with family members, they say it happened because she was depressed and apparently she mixed a series of pills.”Karixia Ortiz, press officer for the Department of Public Safety, confirmed the circumstances of the three deaths to HuffPost on Monday. She also addressed why it’s taken so long to ascertain the number of deaths since Hurricane Maria slammed into the island nearly three weeks ago.Every death must be confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Science, which means either the bodies have to be brought to San Juan to do an autopsy or a medical examiner must be dispatched to the local municipality to verify the death, Ortiz explained.“We try to consult all of the parties who can consult in the analysis of deaths related directly or indirectly to the hurricane,” Ortiz said. “But it’s a complicated process because you have to contextualize the death. Just because a person dies in the days following the hurricane doesn’t mean the death is connected to the hurricane, because every day people in Puerto Rico and all over the world die, including from health complications.”“We’ve always tried to be very careful with the certification of deaths because we want to have all the scientific proof and verifiable evidence that if a person dies as a consequence of the hurricane, that it can be proved,” she continued.The process has been complicated by the storm damage to numerous roads and the lack of communication on the island. As of Monday, only 51 percent of the island had telecommunication service and less than 29 percent of cell towers were functioning. Ortiz said mayors have received satellite phones to help them communicate with officials in San Juan.“We exhaust all resources when it comes to communication ― phone, satellite phone, sending runners,” she said.On Sunday, reporters asked Pesquera about media reports of unaccounted deaths in remote areas of the island. Funeral directors in two towns told BuzzFeed News that they have significantly more bodies than the government counted in a “certified” death toll. A week after the storm, journalist Omaya Sosa Pascual, working for the Center for Investigative Journalism, reported there weredozens of deaths due to lack of medical resources that had gone untallied and wrote of morgues in remote places “at capacity.” She reported on Monday that most of the deaths in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria have likely not been examined yet.Pesquera neither confirmed nor denied these claims on Sunday.“There’s no backlog in bodies,” he said of the deaths that have been reported to the Institute of Forensic Science. “As they are coming in, they are coming out relatively quickly. What there is is bodies that are being kept because the funeral home or the family, for different reasons, can’t pick them up. So we are keeping them there.”“I don’t think there will be hundreds of deaths, but we will see,” he added. “We can’t speculate if there will be 100 or 200. I’m telling you what we’ve seen. We haven’t seen anything that’s going to skyrocket.”Still, the death toll, which had stood for days at 16,jumped to 34 last Tuesday. By Friday, it was 36. Pesquera said the big jump last week came “as a consequence of not having information for two weeks” and because bodies “could not get there” ― that is, to the Institute of Forensic Service.When journalists pushed Pesquera about the rumors that the death toll could eventually reach the hundreds, he maintained that he could only speak to what the institute has reported.“I hope not, I sincerely hope not,” he said about the possibility of a death count in the triple digits. “But I’m not gonna speculate. I don’t care what’s circulating. I care about what the institute can certify. There are all kinds of rumors out there floating around. We don’t deal with rumors; we deal with facts.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-death-toll-39_n_59dbbabae4b0b34afa5b4ba2,HuffPost,Liberal
153,Puerto Rico has a long way to go before being 'OK',Tanzina Vega,10/8/17," As Americans watched the  devastation unfolding in Puerto Rico  last week I read, listened, tweeted and posted information on my social media timelines. Then came the text bubbles on my cell phone screen: ""Is your family ok?"" they asked. ""I'm praying for you,"" they said.  I felt conflicted about how to respond. In some ways, things are ""okay."" The few immediate family members I have on the island are alive. Some rode out the storm from the mainland and are trying to return to their communities to assess the wreckage that awaits. For many Puerto Ricans on the island and in the larger diaspora, however, we have a long way to go before ever getting back to ""okay.""   The island's status as a United States territory -- and by extension, its peculiar and colonial relationship with the United States -- has been exposed to the rest of the world like the roots of the trees left bare from the force of Maria's winds and rain. In a  blistering public statement , a group of Puerto Rican intellectuals and activists said, ""The world has found out in the past few days what our history has always stubbornly made visible to us.""  The effects of Hurricane Maria will force some residents to leave the island, and their homes, behind. The ongoing fiscal crisis has already precipitated a massive loss of talent on the island. We could be on the precipice of yet another great migration to the mainland, with many Puerto Ricans settling throughout the United States. The crisis could also signal a new political awakening among Puerto Ricans eager to examine the colonial status of the island and prevent further economic and cultural erosion.    Many Americans are not aware of the poverty that Puerto Ricans on the island have endured. The median household income for Puerto Ricans there is  roughly $19,000  and  about 43.5% live in poverty . Some are still unaware that we are American citizens or that we have an extensive history of having served in the US military. (My maternal grandfather, for example, served in World War II). And while Puerto Ricans on the island are exempt from personal income taxes,  they still pay billions of dollars a year in other federal taxes .  The island is now bracing for its own major reconstruction, whose cultural, economic and, and psychosocial effects will take years to unravel. Puerto Ricans have always had an imbalanced relationship in the United States: a permanent state of yes, but no. We are United States citizens by birth, but those who live on the island have limited rights. They cannot vote for president and have no vote in Congress. Antiquated policies like the Jones Act, which require all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans, have further hurt the island's economy. I'm a national reporter at CNN on a teaching fellowship at Princeton, but I am also a Puerto Rican woman from New York, a Nuyorican, a Boricua. I spent half of my childhood visiting my family on the island in many of the towns that have been decimated by Hurricane Maria, including Utuado and Arecibo. Generations of my family have lived and died on the island. Many of my generation grew up listening to tales of the radical Young Lords Party of the 1970s, swinging to our parents' old salsa records and creating icons of our own, including Sonia Sotomayor, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Lin Manuel Miranda. I took for granted that the Puerto Rico I knew would always exist. Like my grandparents, I assumed that one day I would be able to return and have my own small piece of paradise. After Maria, a  harrowing report in The Washington Post  described Utuado, where my father's side of the family is from, as ""a prison"" with residents trapped by mudslides, impassable roads and little to no food, drinking water or power. Nestled deep in the lush mountains of Puerto Rico's Cordillera Central, it used to take hours of navigating curving twisted roads to reach Utudao. I know the trip well. I made it almost every time I visited Puerto Rico as part of the annual island pilgrimage many mainlanders made to visit our abuelos, our tios and our primos. It was that deceptively simple fluidity of movement, from the island to the mainland and back, that helped create the bicultural and transmigratory ties many Puerto Ricans still have to the island.    The response to Maria could also make more Puerto Ricans politically engaged than they have been in the past. ""It's a call to action for Puerto Ricans in the diaspora, that we all have to get to the polls and make sure that if our island counterparts can't have their voice heard during elections that we vote on their behalf,"" said Elizabeth Aranda, a sociology professor at the University of South Florida and author of the book ""Emotional Bridges to Puerto Rico.""  ""What affects them on the island affects us."" ""Puerto Ricans have paid their dues, even though people think that haven't,"" Aranda also observed. ""They have been paying taxes, they pay higher prices for consumer items, they are the testing ground for all sorts of experiments."" Indeed, Puerto Rican women in particular have been used to testing pharmaceutical products from birth control to opioids like OxyContin.  A  Los Angeles Times investigation  found that the first patients to use the drug were ""women recuperating from abdominal and gynecological surgery at two hospitals in Puerto Rico in 1989.""  President Trump, during his visit to the island this week,  tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd  and callously remarked on how few people had died and how much recovery efforts would cost the United States. He added to the pain that many Puerto Ricans are feeling, in a way that Aranda described as ""a form of symbolic violence."" Many Puerto Ricans may be asking themselves, Is this really my country? Today, the United States is experiencing a wave of calls for racial and social justice in a way that we haven't seen in decades. Puerto Ricans, who are black, white and brown are not exempt from that discussion. In addition to the ""symbolic violence"" we are experiencing post-Maria, we too have been impacted by mass incarceration, police brutality, racial profiling and unfair socio-economic policies.  The summers I spent in Puerto Rico were one of the brightest parts of my childhood. They were an escape from the pressures many of us experienced living on the mainland. Instead of being surrounded by red brick public housing buildings, I would rock back and forth on the hammock my grandparents in Barceloneta had hung on the balcony of their home, reading and watching the trees bend in the breeze. I woke up to the sound of a rooster's crow as chickens clucked in the gravel and dirt yard. Lemons grew on a tree in front of the house. My grandfather would pluck them one by one, gingerly slicing and squeezing them to make juice. My cousins and I ran around in plastic chancletas, t-shirts and shorts and ate homemade ice pops. Those summer breaks were a respite of nature and love. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on  Twitter  and  Facebook When my grandfather in Utuado died I was about a year into my first reporting job at The New York Times. At the top of those mountains, I delivered an impromptu eulogy as raindrops gently tapped the dark green awning covering his casket and our small group of mourners. I had spent the day before the funeral cleaning out drawers in his bedroom and had found various files he kept for decades including a certificate from when he studied English during night classes at the local high school in New York City and receipts for classes on how to repair washing machines and other household appliances. He even did a short stint as a busboy in the New York Times cafeteria. Even though his English was still not advanced enough to read the paper, he would occasionally take a copy home for his cousin to read. When he died, I placed a copy of the paper with a front-page story I had written in the casket. ""We made it, abuelo,"" I said.

84,"Elon Musk Floats Solar Overhaul Of Puerto Rico Power Grid, Governor Says 'Let's Talk'",Carla Herreria Russo,10/6/17,"With90 percent of Puerto Rico still without power,Elon Musk has made hurricane-wrecked island an offer its governor couldn’t refuse.TheTesla CEO tweeted Thursday that his company is capable of rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power grid, much of which wasdestroyed by Hurricane Maria, to run on solar power and batteries.“The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” the tech billionaire tweeted on Thursday.However, Musk added, the vast project would require approval from the both the federal government and that of Puerto Rico, as well as commercial stakeholders. Musk floated the idea in response to a Twitter follower who suggested he take up the project.But then Ricardo Rosselló, the governor of Puerto Rico, seemed intrigued by the offer and proposed the U.S. island territory could be Musk’s solar “flagship project.”“Let’s talk,” Rosselló tweeted to Musk late Thursday. “Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies?”When Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it devastated much of the island, forcing thousands into shelters, destroying 80 percent of the value of the island’s agricultural industry and downing nearly all 2,400 miles of its power transmission lines.But even before Maria, Puerto Rico’s power grid was fragile. The island’s only energy provider, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, was $9 billion in debt, and the grid suffered from constant power outages due to poor maintenance, the Los Angeles Times reported.The aging grid was especially susceptible to storms and unforeseen accidents. Last year, a fire at one of the island’s main power plants left millions in the dark. So Musk’s offer to turn Puerto Rico into one of his own solar projects may be a silver lining in the aftermath of Maria’s destruction. He’s been successful in this arena in the past, though on much smaller scales.In November, the Tesla-owned SolarCity helped a 17-square-mile island in American Samoa that was reliant on diesel fuel become powered almost completely by solar energy.The Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Interior and the American Samoa Power Authority funded the $8 million project to establish a 7-acre solar farm on the island. It is capable of storing energy in 60 Tesla Powerpacks (the company’s batteries) that can provide the island’s 600 residents with energy for up to three days without sun, according to National Geographic.This year, Telsa finished a larger solar farm on the Hawaiian island of Kauai on 50 acres of land, with Powerpacks to store enough energy to service an estimated 4,500 homes.Puerto Rico, which currently relies on imported oil to generate electricity, could benefit from a Musk-inspired takeover, but with 3,515 square miles and 3.4 million people, the island-wide project could be Tesla’s most ambitious project of its kind so far.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s debt.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
83,Experimental Balloon Project Aims To Give Cell Reception To Puerto Rico,Doha Madani,10/6/17,"Project Loon aims to try and restore emergency cellular reception service to the devastated island of Puerto Rico after the Federal Communications Commission approved a license on Friday.Project Loon will work to restore emergency service to the island, where fewer than a fourth of the cell towers are working. FCC chief of staff Matthew Berry tweeted the news on Friday evening, two days after the commission approved a $77 million plan to restore telecommunications services to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was also a hurricane victim.Berry said in his announcement that the license was issued to Google. However, the FCC issued the license to Loon, a project by the company X. X, formerly known as Google X, is no longer part of Google, though both are owned by the same company, Alphabet.Project Loon, a program that would bring internet and cell service to rural and remote areas across the world through polyethylene balloons, has yet to be fully developed. But its plan is to equip balloons with redesigned components of traditional cell towers, made lighter and powered with solar panels. A spokesperson with X told Mashable it was unclear if the balloons would be as successful in responding to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria as it had been when extreme flooding hit Peru in May. “We were able to connect people in Peru quickly because we were already working closely with Telefonica on some testing; in this case, things are a little more complicated because we’re starting from scratch,” the spokesperson said in a statement. As a result of Hurricane Maria, 90 percent of Puerto Rico is still without power, making communication nearly impossible. A week after Maria made landfall, residents in the United States reported being completely unable to get in contact with their families on the island. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also expressed interest in helping to restore Puerto Rico’s power by using the company’s solar infrastructure technology.

82,"After Backlash, FEMA Once Again Has Puerto Rico Power, Water Stats On Main Website",Carolina Moreno,10/6/17,"Nearly halfof Puerto Rican citizens on the island do not have access to drinking water and a whopping89.3 percent do not have power, according to Friday reports ― but, for a moment, you wouldn’t have known that by looking at the Federal Emergency Management Agency website.FEMA temporarily removed statistics about Puerto Ricans’ access to drinking water and electricity from its main website, The Washington Postfirst reported on Thursday afternoon. FEMA Director of Public Affairs William Booher told the newspaper that the figures were still being reported on www.status.pr, a Spanish-language only site that is run by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló.The language barrier would have likely been a limiting factor for non-Spanish speaking American citizens looking to stay up-to-date on figures during Puerto Rico’s current crisis. It might have also made it harder for the English-dominated U.S. media to cover the critical situation. Booher told CNN on Friday morning that the Status.pr website is being “updated daily with different information.”“In fact, [the water and power statistics] cited have moved in a positive direction since that post, so no reason to ‘remove’ it,”he added. “To characterize updating a webpage as ‘removing’ information is and was misleading by the original story.”In a statement to HuffPost on Friday afternoon, Booher said they had added the data back onto the FEMA website. Read the full statement below:FEMA officials provide response and recovery updates in a variety of ways, to include through daily press conferences, news releases and social media posts. The Government of Puerto Rico provides information on the status of infrastructure on its publicly available website (http://www.status.pr) that we regularly use as a source of information for our reports. FEMA’s Hurricane Maria website includes a range of information directly related to the federal response, and we often include some data from the Puerto Rico website. While some information was not included in yesterday’s update to our website, at no point was the data not publicly available. Reports suggesting an effort to ‘remove’ any data points are simply erroneous.To avoid any further confusion, this information will be posted on our Hurricane Maria website going forward, and will include a link to the Government of Puerto Rico website.More than two weeks after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, the number of citizens without drinking water has gone from 55 percent on Sunday to44.5 percent as of Friday. While the number of Puerto Ricans with power has increased from around 7 percent on Tuesday to 10.7 percent on Friday. But these gains are marginal as the Trump administration and federal agenciesstruggle to offer adequate and efficient aid to the U.S. territory with more than 3.4 million people.On Twitter, some expressed concern that removing these crucial statistics from FEMA’s English-language website came off as an attempt to hide the slow recovery efforts on the island. The data’s temporary removal from FEMA’s main website comes after President Donald Trump visited the island on Tuesday. During his visit, Trump repeatedly applauded federal relief efforts on the island and suggested that the then-death toll of 16 meant Puerto Rico’s situation was not “a real catastrophe like Katrina.”“Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said on Tuesday. “You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what’s taking place in Puerto Rico.”Hours after Trump’s press briefing on the island, Gov. Rosselló announced that the death toll had more than doubled. As of Friday morning, the death toll stood at 36.UPDATE 10/7/2017 11:40 A.M.: The www.status.pr website now has an English-language version of the information listed.

85,In aftermath of María: Trump vs. Puerto Rico,"Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",10/5/17,"The anxiety was palpable at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport for residents of Puerto Rico who managed to leave recently, many with pets in tow. Yet despite sweltering heat in terminals without air-conditioning, cheers when disaster volunteers disembarked from arriving flights.Some Puerto Ricans living stateside also flew in; what would make them return now? Sheer anguish of not being able to contact loved ones left incommunicado by a telecommunications collapse caused by the Category 4 –bordering on 5– hurricane that struck a devastating blow two weeks ago. Then flies in “45,” as President Trump is often called, the 6th U.S. president to make an official visit to Puerto Rico. All the presidents that have visited Puerto Rico are immortalized with statues at the state capitol. Trump’s might well be depicted with arm raised, lobbing a roll of Bounty.Increased military presence leading up to his visit aimed to rewrite the script of widely reported failures in distributing aid, just in time for a choreographed media-op by the Kim Kardashian of politicians. Some local analysts had worried it would be more branding than substance, more TV than reality. It turned out to be worse–downright insulting.For Saturday Night Live it might be difficult to top, as Trump has become a parody of himself, recently dedicating a golf tournament trophy to victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and María. With amnesia of “you’re doing a heck of a job, Brownie,” Trump tweeted that all buildings in Puerto Rico have been inspected. Pro-statehood governor Ricky Rosselló, alternating calls for aid with praise of federal efforts, didn’t quite know what to make of the claim.The indelible image from his visit to the island: Trump lobbing rolls of paper towels into a crowd as if at seals. He also told officials that the worst catastrophe to beset the island in a century had strained the federal budget. Moody’s has set Puerto Rico’s losses at $45 to $95 billion. In a country of 3.4 million, 95 percent are without power, and about 50 percent without water. Interminable gas lines still snarl traffic. Cash-strapped customers still wait hours at finally opened supermarkets, often to find nearly empty shelves.Fewer than 20 of 69 hospitals have regular electricity, about half of dialysis centers were closed midweek, and for the many diabetics, insulin requires refrigeration or ice. Indeed some of the 5 million Puerto Ricans living stateside now struggle to get relatives with medical needs out. There is something abhorrent in the spinning of news when so many lives are at stake. Trump touted that only 16 had died, then after he left the official count rose to 34. But news estimates are much higher and the current death toll is impossible to determine. Some rural areas still remain completely isolated. Local food sovereignty activists on the ground see risk of starvation. There have been calls for a massive airlift.“San Juan looks to me like Basra in 1991,” said veteran Reinaldo Piñero Medina, who was an air defense platoon sergeant in Desert Storm. Recently working security at a Banco Popular, he had not yet heard from his daughter on the north coast of Manatí. President Trump’s colonial insinuation that Puerto Ricans were not working hard enough to overcome the calamity added insult to injury before his visit, when so much endless toil is evident on mass media. Now the mood of uncertainty preceding the storm is compounded.The economy was already crippled by a $72 billion debt and $46 billion in pension obligations, with bankruptcy declared in May. The debt had reached explosive proportions in part because of Puerto Rico’s territorial status, which allowed triple tax-free municipal bonds that were especially popular. Making it worse, vulture hedge funds preyed on bonds once risky with sky-high interest.With a year-old federal law, cynically called Promesa, came a bankruptcy mechanism and a fiscal control board tasked with imposing painful austerity. In this economic climate, recent years saw record population decline.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz now calls for a 10-year moratorium, while others pitch debt forgiveness. Even Trump called for canceling the debt, though presidents don’t have the constitutional power to do so–likely just more spin. The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda is promoting a Marshall Plan that requires $70 billion. Requests multiply to exempt Puerto Rico from the 100-year-old Jones Act, seen across political sectors as an antiquated maritime monopoly that has long hindered Puerto Rico’s economy. Trump’s temporary suspension ends Sunday, with much of the country still in emergency mode. The collapse of a neglected, petroleum-based electric utility and reliance on diesel for back-up generators both testify to the incalculable cost of fossil fuel dependency (especially considering the effect on climate change super storms). What better time to switch to renewable energy, and cut ties with the toxic-ash-producing corporation AES and the Aguirre Offshore GasPort project, both opposed by the Peñuelas and Salinas communities of the south. The winds of change post-hurricane María should sweep away Puerto Rico’s Jones Act and fiscal control board altogether. Even outside investor Nicholas Prouty declared Promesa obsolete. He and hundreds of multi-millionaires have been attracted to Puerto Rico by laws 20 and 22, controversial measures that guarantee zero percent income and capital gains tax rates for 20 years as long as they reside on the island for six months of the year. These laws, along with recent off-shore banking, and Sotheby’s luxury real estate sales, envisioned Puerto Rico as a tax haven (though more apt is the literal translation from Spanish: fiscal paradise). Tax these dodgers for the recovery, at the very least.The disaster has also stoked fears of accelerated public sector privatization and neighborhood gentrification. In San Juan’s iconic barrio La Perla–setting of the blockbuster video for Despacito–the storm destroyed wooden homes but colorful cement dwellings still stand. In the early morning hours the day after María hit, as folks cleaned up debris, a community leader stood her ground, saying in Spanish, “they’d have to kill us to get us out of here.” What Puerto Rico needs is a Marshall plan and debt forgiveness–not loans. If post-hurricane policies do not veer radically, expect more Exodus. The destination of displaced Puerto Rican U.S. citizens will be the soon-to-be Blue State of Florida. And then María will most definitely be Trump’s Katrina. ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-aftermath-of-mar%25C3%25ADa-trump-vs-puerto-rico_b_59d694dbe4b0cf2548b3359d,HuffPost,Liberal
87,"Why Cholera Isn't Likely In Puerto Rico, But Other Diseases Are",Stephanie Pappas,10/4/17,"Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, only 5 percent of Puerto Ricans have electricity and less than half have clean drinking water, according to the territorial governor’s office. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said residents of the island are safe from one potential threat: cholera.New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted on Saturday (Sept. 30) that cholera had been reported in the U.S. territory, but then walked back that claim. The CDC tweeted that same day that cholera is not a likely threat to the island, because there had been no reports of the bacterium that causes the disease before the hurricane. “CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria,” the agency tweeted, continuing in a second tweet: “There was no evidence of cholera in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands before Hurricane #Maria made landfall.” [10 Bizarre Diseases You Can Get Outdoors]Diarrheal diseaseCholera is a disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It spreads mostly through water contaminated by the feces of someone who harbors the illness, according to the CDC. It can also be found in brackish coastal waters and can hitch a ride into the human digestive system on contaminated shellfish from these waters.Once in the body, V. cholera feeds off a sugar in the intestines called sialic acid, researchers reported in 2011 in the journal Microbiology. It then excretes a toxin that opens channels in the cells that make up the intestine wall, disrupting the electrolyte balance of the intestines and forcing water from the cells.For many people, the disease causes either no symptoms or mild to moderate diarrhea, but for people severely infected, the dehydration from the excessive water loss can kill within hours. Firm mortality rates are hard to come by, given that most deaths happen in remote areas and the cases aren’t reported, but the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cholera kills up to 143,000 people worldwide each year. The disease can be treated with antibiotics and intravenous rehydration, and fatality rates are highest where medical help is hard to reach, according to the CDC.Post-Maria Puerto RicoAs Puerto Rico struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, sanitation is a concern. Fifty-five percent of the island lacks running water, according to the governor’s office, and Bloomberg reported that residents are bathing and washing clothes in rivers. Many people are getting water from roadside springs, according to NPR, or hoping their hoarded supplies from before the storm don’t run out before tap water is restored.Even without cholera, if any of these ad hoc water sources become contaminated with feces, it could mean a major public health problem. According to the CDC, diseases such as hepatitis A can spread through contaminated drinking water. So can other diarrheal illnesses, including enteroviruses, Giardia and Campylobacter. Standing water after the hurricane may also become prime breeding ground for mosquitos. Zika virus, which causes mostly mild fever in adults but severe birth defects in developing fetuses, is already found in Puerto Rico and spreads via mosquito bites.The aftermath of a natural disaster is a ripe time for epidemics. In 2010, 10 months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, the country experienced a massive cholera outbreak. By 2014, at least 8,534 people had died in Haiti from the disease. Like Puerto Rico, Haiti did not have endemic cholera bacteria before the quake; the disease arrived with Nepalese peacekeepers who came to the island as part of the United Nations’ relief effort (cholera is endemic, or consistently present, in Nepal). Poor sanitation at the peacekeepers’ camp sent the disease into waterways, while the widespread lack of clean water and sanitation after the earthquake transmitted the bacteria rapidly.Original article on Live Science.

88,San Juan Mayor Slams Donald Trump For 'Terrible And Abominable' Puerto Rico Stunt,Ed Mazza,10/4/17,"The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico blasted President Donald Trump’s meeting with local leaders on the island Tuesday as a public relations stunt.“There was no exchange with anybody, with none of the mayors,” Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said on MSNBC. She called out Trump for the bizarre moment when he tossed paper towels to storm survivors in need of supplies after Hurricane Maria left many on the island without basic necessities.“This terrible and abominable view of him throwing paper towels and throwing provisions at people, it does not embody the spirit of the American nation,” Cruz said. “That is not the land of the free and the home of the brave, that beacon of democracy that people have learned to look up to across the world.” She also said the president had a communications problem and called him the “miscommunicator-in-chief.” Cruz made headlines last week when she slammed the federal government for its slow response to the storm and pleaded for help from anyone able to provide it. “I am going to do what I never thought I would do. I am begging, begging anyone who can hear us to save us from dying,” Cruz said in a tearful news conference last Friday. “We are dying, and you are killing us with inefficiency and bureaucracy.”On Twitter, Trump claimed the mayor had been told by Democrats that she must be “nasty” to him. “Actually, I was asking for help,” she later said. “I wasn’t saying anything nasty about the president.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/san-juan-mayor-trump-abominable_n_59d48333e4b0218923e632d9,HuffPost,Liberal
154,Trump's Puerto Rico event was way worse than his tweets,Chris Cillizza,10/4/17," President Donald Trump faced a major test on Tuesday as he traveled to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico: Show the American citizens struggling for survival on the island that he understood their plight, sympathized with them and was doing everything in his power to make it better as quickly as he could. He failed. Hugely. Soon after touching down in Puerto Rico, Trump said the following to government officials: ""Every death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous — hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here, with really a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody's ever seen anything like this. What is your death count as of this moment? 17? 16 people certified, 16 people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico."" Where to begin???? How about that suggesting that what happened in Puerto Rico -- an entire island devastated, huge swaths without power, food and water in short supply --  wasn't a ""real"" catastrophe because not that many people died?  Or, what about using death count as a talking point? Yes, it's true that far more people died in Katrina (1,800+) than did in Maria (16). But, for the families of the 16 who died, that loss is no less heart-breaking. Loss of life is loss of life. And we're not even dealing with the thousands of people whose lives have been fundamentally altered, forever, as a result of this storm -- for whom things will never be the same and may well be far, far worse. (Nota bene: After Trump left Puerto Rico, the country's governor Ricardo Rosello announced that the death toll had risen to 34.) ""Proud"" is not the right word for how people should -- or do -- feel. It's not even close. It's the opposite of empathy. Instead of mourning with and for those who lost their lives, Trump is using those who lost their lives as a way to make a broader argument that the media's criticism of him is unfair and biased.   See, I told you I was doing a great job, Trump was saying. Everyone here thinks so! Me, me, me, me. While Trump's comments about the relatively small number of deaths will draw the most attention -- and rightly so -- there's so much else in Trump's relatively brief comments that speaks to the fact that he lacks the empathy gene. Among them: * ""It's a great trip. Your weather is second to none but every once in a while you get hit. And you really got hit."" Your weather is second to none? The country has literally been leveled by a hurricane.   * ""You've thrown our budget a little out of whack. We've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico."" Trump was, ostensibly, joking about how much money the recovery efforts were costing him. Listen to the audio and see how many people laughed. Also, this is like buying the school textbooks your kid needs and then repeatedly reminding him how much the books costs and how he kind of, sort of owes you. * ""He started right at the beginning appreciating what we did...He was giving us the highest grades."" Trump is praising Puerto Rico's Gov. Ricardo Rosselló here -- but really he is praising himself. This governor, who I didn't know before this storm, said nice things about me. Which you should hear. Because people are saying some not nice things. * ""She was saying such nice things about all of the people who have worked so hard. Jenniffer, do you think you can say a little bit about what you said about us?"" Trump is referring here to Puerto Rico Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon,  who he says he ""watched' (on TV of course) say nice things about how Trump and his administration handled the hurricane. After Gonzalez-Colon finished praising Trump, the president added: ""We saw those comments and everyone saw those comments. * ""General Kelly is a four star. You don't get any better than a four star."" Trump is very keen on highlighting the accomplishments of the generals on his staff -- most notably his chief of staff John Kelly. But, why is Kelly's military rank relevant when it comes to Puerto Rico's recovery? Watch the video. Kelly seems wholly uncomfortable being trotted out by Trump in this moment. The whole 13+ minutes is surreal. Time and time again, Trump makes the whole thing about him -- using the various officials, military and otherwise, around him to reinforce the ideas that he is doing a great job.  On display is someone wholly wrapped up in himself, incapable of understanding that this moment -- on the ground of a historic natural disaster for the Puerto Rican people --was not about him. This is Trump off the telemprompter. Twitter Trump. Trump's real personality -- when words are not being carefully selected for him.  Trump knew --  because everyone wrote about it  and TV talked about it relentlessly -- that the big question today in Puerto Rico was whether he could show some actual empathy, some human kindness to people he didn't know but who were still his constituents. And,  even knowing that , Trump delivered a navel-gazing, self-championing, victimhood-seeking speech that reeked of tone-deafness and out-of-touch-ism. Even for this President, who has redefined presidential -- and not for the better -- this is a truly remarkable low. But he wasn't done. According to an on-the-ground report from CNN's Kevin Liptak, Trump seemed to see himself in a sort of Santa Claus role while handing out supplies to disaster victims. Here's a bit of Liptak's reporting: Trump, along with the first lady and the governor, shook hands with the crowd. Trump, still wearing a wind breaker, picked up a can of tinned chicken breast and held it up for the crowd to see. He handed a pack of batteries to a man, as many in the crowd held up their cell phones. Trump held up a flashlight and showed it to the crowd, while shaking hands. The  first lady  followed close behind. Trump kept picking up items from tables laden with supplies, showing them to the crowd and handing them to people with outstretched hands. ""There's a lot of love in this room,"" the President said. ""Great people.""",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/trump-puerto-rico/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiTzobE2Mj6AhWNSjABHaypAyY4MhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw3aszjyEmaTf6U0vzPWvDdD,CNN,Liberal
86,Bethenny Frankel Sends Four Planes To Puerto Rico For Hurricane Relief,Cole Delbyck,10/4/17,"While the current administrationcontinues to flounder over hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, “Real Housewives of New York” star Bethenny Frankel has taken matters into her own hands. After traveling to Mexico earlier this year toaid earthquake victims, the Skinnygirl CEO has gone above and beyond to respond to the crisis in Puerto Rico, traveling to the island weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall as a Category 4 storm. Frankel chartered four planes to the U.S. island territory filled with 20,000 lbs. of medical and survival supplies, including water, canned goods, baby food, diapers and insulin donated by various organizations through the reality TV star’sB. Strong charity. She also came armed with nearly $60,000 in gift cards, thanks to Costco and Yieldstreet, to be distributed to those impacted by the hurricane.“This is a forgotten island,” Frankel toldPeople. “People have been living on their roofs for 13 days. It is like nothing I have ever seen. People’s entire homes and cars are immersed in mud, the likes I’ve never seen.” In the wake of Hurricane Maria, residents have been living without power and limited access to clean drinking water. Given the widespread devastation, the number of fatalities is difficult to determine, but at least 16 people have died as a result of the hurricane. “We arrived in the first town before their own mayor,” Frankel told People. “We pulled onto a street with a truck of basic necessities, and you would have thought I was giving out diamonds. What struck me was people politely waiting in line patiently. They are so proud. I gave them cash cards in envelopes, and they were emotional yet still proud. Their faith is intact.”“There is no color on the island,” she added. “Every palm tree is rooted. This bitch hit every inch of this island. The low death toll is only counting what happened when it hit, but a storm happens more gradually than a hurricane. Now is when people are dying. They are starving. They are thirsty. They cannot communicate. They cannot bathe themselves. They wash their babies and laundry in street water. It is a war zone. I do not play the blame game, but the 73 towns of Puerto Rico need to be methodically mapped out and visited, and the relief needs to be organized, delegated and executed.”Once the supplies had been distributed across the island, Frankel refused to head back to the mainland solo. Instead, she helped a handful of cancer patients, as well as women and children in peril, travel to the mainland for medical attention. With donations from celebrities like Andy Cohen and Elvis Duran, in addition to her own personal donations and support from The Global Empowerment Mission, Frankel is set to raise more than $1 million for hurricane relief. And she’s already working on getting a fifth plane sent to Puerto Rico. For more information about how to help victims of Hurricane Maria, click here.

158,Trump tosses paper towels into Puerto Rico crowd,Caroline Kenny,10/3/17," While surveying the damage in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, President Donald Trump visited with survivors and helped distribute supplies -- at one point throwing paper towels into the crowd. Upon entering a multipurpose room at the Calvary Chapel in the Guaynabo neighborhood of the island, Trump was met with cheers and supportive signs welcoming his presence. The President began to pick up cans of chicken to show to the crowd and then handed one man a pack of batteries. Next, he held up a flashlight and showed it off while shaking hands with the Puerto Rico residents there to obtain provisions. ""There's a lot of love in this room,"" Trump said while giving out the supplies. ""Great people."" Trump continued to raise different items up in the air for the patrons to see while shaking hands and passing out objects, before grabbing rolls of paper towels. Then Trump began to toss rolls of paper towels into the crowd. Several of the rolls were caught by Puerto Rico residents in the room, but a few fell onto the carpeted floor. Trump's  trip to Puerto Rico  came as  frustration on the island mounted  with the federal response to the storm as the island remained without power. Residents continue to  struggle to get access to food and fuel  nearly two weeks after the storm hit.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/donald-trump-paper-towels-puerto-rico/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiq4ee-68j6AhVdSDABHcVLClg4-gEQFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw2ZvwBcregJ8ya4P_be9LF9,CNN,Liberal
93,"Trump Downplays Puerto Rico's Suffering, Says It's Not A 'Real Catastrophe Like Katrina'",Marina Fang,10/3/17,"PresidentDonald Trump visited local officials and residents in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, congratulating them and boasting almost two weeks after Hurricane Maria left many of the island’s 3.4 million people without power, water or food.At his first stop, a briefing with federal and local officials, Trump lavishly praised them. He then repeatedly turned to individuals around the table and invited them to offer their own praise — while insisting, “It’s not about me.”When Puerto Rico’s governor told Trump that 16 people so far had been reported dead, the president lauded officials and minimized the hurricane’s damage, suggesting it was not “a real catastrophe like Katrina.”“Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said. “You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what’s taking place in Puerto Rico.”While Trump bragged about the official number of dead, the final death toll willlikely turn out to be higher. Poor communication services have hindered reporting, and current living conditions on the island could jeopardize more lives, especially those of the sick and the elderly. Trump also appeared to joke about the cost of the storm damage.“I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,” he said.The group of officials around the table applauded several times. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, whom Trump has repeatedly attacked online, did not join in, “keeping her hands clasped in front of her,” according to a White House pool report.The trip comes after Trump repeatedly bragged about his administration’s response to the hurricane’s devastation, blamed the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for its debt crisis and called Cruz “nasty” for criticizing the federal government’s sluggish relief efforts.Trump, who visited Texas twice in the days following Hurricane Harvey and headed to Florida four days after Hurricane Irma, said last week that he was delaying a visit to Puerto Rico “because of the first responders, and we don’t want to disrupt the relief efforts.”Tensions were high ahead of the president’s visit. Trump had attacked the island’s residents and leaders, saying they wanted “everything to be done for them” after Cruz begged for additional aid.“The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” he wrote on Twitter.Trump contends his administration has done a “great job with the almost impossible situation.” Puerto Rico, he noted, was already facing crippling debt before the storm. He said Texas and Florida were “doing great” in the aftermath of hurricanes that hit those states last month. As he departed the White House on Tuesday morning, the president again lauded the federal response, despite the continued suffering of residents and criticism from officials like Cruz.“I think she’s come back a long way,” Trump said of Cruz. “I think it’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done. In Texas and Florida, we get an A-plus. And I’ll tell you what, I think we’ve done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it’s actually a much tougher situation.”Again he said that “at a local level, they have to give us more help,” while praising the “incredible job” of federal officials.“Whether it’s her or anybody else, they’re all starting to say it,” Trump said.Following the briefing with federal and local officials on Tuesday, Trump visited with storm victims. He again praised officials for doing “a fantastic job,” as people showed him the storm’s damage to their homes, pointing out broken windows and noting power outages.“We’re going to help you out,” he told them. “Have a good time.”During a stop at a church, he threw rolls of paper towels into a crowd.In truth, conditions in Puerto Rico remain dire.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has shipped millions of gallons of water and meals to Puerto Rico, but the island no longer has the infrastructure to widely deliver those supplies. Puerto Rican officials said last week that they were unable to move aid across the island without electricity and fuel.Until last week, shipments to the island were also restricted by the Jones Act, a law that increases shipping costs for goods going to Puerto Rico. Trump allowed a temporary waiver of the law last Thursday. As of Monday, all 10 of Puerto Rico’s airports were open, and about 37 percent of people had cellphone service, according to the Department of Defense. Two Navy ships are due to arrive Tuesday with more supplies.Still, almost all of Puerto Rico is without electricity, and about half the population lacks drinking water.This article has been updated with details from Trump’s visit.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated incorrectly that “all 10 of Puerto Rico’s hospitals” had been reopened.

155,Oxfam criticizes US government response in Puerto Rico,Caroline Kenny,10/3/17," Oxfam, a global organization working to end poverty, is criticizing the  United States government's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico  in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The group specifically criticized President Donald Trump's administration. ""Oxfam has monitored the response in Puerto Rico closely, and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US government has mounted in Puerto Rico,"" Oxfam America President Abby Maxman said in a statement. ""Clean water, food, fuel, electricity, and health care are in desperately short supply and quickly dwindling, and we're hearing excuses and criticism from the administration instead of a cohesive and compassionate response."" The group rarely criticizes government strategies in crises affecting wealthy nations such as the US. ""The US has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner,"" Maxman said. Trump will be visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday to survey the damage. During a briefing Monday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the administration's response. ""(President Trump) will assure the people there that we are with them 100% today and for the long haul. Puerto Ricans have shown incredible resilience, and we are fully committed to helping them rebuild their lives,"" she said. Maxman said that Oxfam America will  pursue its own two-pronged approach  to helping the island, which will consist of advocating for an overall improved response to the disaster and supporting local affiliates who are on site in Puerto Rico and can provide relief.  The organization will continue to  push the government , including Congress and other federal agencies, to provide better relief and remove any barriers in place that can inhibit progress.  ""Oxfam has a long history of holding governments, including in the US, accountable to protect the most vulnerable in times of crisis,"" Scott Paul, humanitarian policy lead for Oxfam America, said in a statement to CNN. ""Sometimes, that means helping them hold the government accountable, and in Puerto Rico, accountability is sorely needed."" This isn't the first time Oxfam has been critical of the Trump administration. The organization condemned the administration for slashing refugee admissions to the lowest level in history and last month it  rented out the childhood home of Trump in Queens, New York , and invited refugees to come and share their stories.

156,Trump contrasts Puerto Rico death toll to 'a real catastrophe like Katrina',Kaitlan Collins,10/3/17," President Donald Trump told  Puerto Rican officials Tuesday they should be ""very proud""  that hundreds of people haven't died after Hurricane Maria as they did in ""a real catastrophe like Katrina."" ""Every death is a horror,"" Trump said, ""but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous -- hundreds and hundreds of people that died -- and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering ... no one has ever seen anything like this."" ""What is your death count?"" he asked as he turned to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. ""17?"" ""16,"" Rosselló answered. ""16 people certified,"" Trump said. ""Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico."" According to FEMA, 1,833 people died in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Before Trump arrived Tuesday, Rosselló said he expected the death count to rise.  ""I've established from the get-go that due to the magnitude of this event it is likely that that number is going to go up,"" Rosselló told reporters at a news conference Tuesday. The White House has pushed back on the notion that Maria is this administration's version of Katrina, and the President praised relief efforts in Puerto Rico as he departed Washington Tuesday.  ""I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico and it's actually a much tougher situation,"" Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. ""But now the roads are clear, communications starting to come back.""  On the ground in Puerto Rico, Trump also appeared to blame the island and its 3.5 million residents for throwing the federal budget ""a little out of whack."" ""I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack,"" Trump said with a grin. ""Because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that's fine, we've saved a lot of lives."" But the bulk of Trump's remarks on Tuesday focused on praising his administration's response to the destructive hurricane, even as more than half of the island's roughly 3.5 million residents still lack access to potable water and as nearly all of the island remains without power.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/trump-puerto-rico-katrina-deaths/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjzi-Kj5cj6AhWyQzABHYFYASA4vgEQFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw2FNmOHdcOjizmpVd09D-rc,CNN,Liberal
157,Dr. Sanjay Gupta's dire warning on Puerto Rico,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Chief Medical Correspondent",10/3/17," In medicine, there is a meeting that takes place behind closed doors, where doctors openly discuss their cases, including any complications or unfortunate deaths.  It's always an indelible experience for me as I watch some fellow physicians defend their actions, while others quickly admit to their mistakes or judgment lapses. No matter the circumstances, though, none of us ever want to hear the term ""preventable death."" When that happens, it's an admission of failure and a breakdown of our entire medical system. In all my years of attending these meetings, I've only heard the term on a few rare occasions. Each time, it's caused the room to go stone silent.    Yet in Puerto Rico I have heard the term several times a day, every day, as local doctors, mayors and citizens worry that many of the most vulnerable citizens are at risk, mostly due to a failure of a timely, coordinated response by the authorities, both federal and territorial.   For want of insulin, blood pressure medications and antibiotics, things widely available at any neighborhood pharmacy in the US mainland, people in Puerto Rico will die -- are dying -- preventable deaths. Puerto Rico was not a healthy island before the hurricanes devastated its infrastructure and lines of communication. Diabetes is rampant, and residents are older and poorer than on the mainland. Add an economic recession and a shortage of medical specialists, and you have the perfect storm. There may be 10s of thousands of hardy people who survived the hurricane and are now struggling to stay alive in its aftermath. They are teetering on the edge, with hardly any reserve.    I don't think I will ever understand or accept meaningless suffering. As a doctor and a journalist who has worked in disaster zones for 15 years, it is one of the most frustrating things on which I report. As a human, it makes me question what we hold most important and dear.   A few days ago, 62-year-old Josefina Alvarez lay sweltering on a cot in a shelter not far from San Juan. It was suffocating in there. The humidity was so thick I could barely breathe. No food, and just a few bottles of water. I saw one filled with urine on a windowsill.   For 10 days before my visit, she had battled unstable blood sugars, progressively lower oxygenation to her lungs and an infection that now required IV antibiotics. She survived the hurricane but was now quickly deteriorating and at real risk of developing sepsis: an overwhelming body infection that could kill her. As I saw her laying on that cot full of tears, pleading for help, I found myself suddenly crying with her, physically hurting with her. And suddenly I could not help but imagine my own family -- my own mother, dignified and hardworking -- begging for a simple medication that could save her life.   You try it. Think of your own family in the horror of a situation like that. It will knock the wind out of you.   Luckily, we were able to help Josefina evacuate to a hospital, where she needed antibiotics and an operation to clear the infection that caused her to be so sick.   The very next day, I traveled to Barrio Melilla outside Loiza, again not far from San Juan, with a team of medical volunteers from Project Hope, an international non-governmental organization. There we found more of the hurricane's walking wounded.   People like Jobita Cumaquita, battling both cancer and diabetes, but more concerned with how her 22-year-old granddaughter, Estefani, will manage without her father. A couple of days before the storm hit, he went to the hospital for an elective visit to address his blood sugar. He had made similar visits many times before, Estefani said, and he had always come home healthy shortly after treatment. But in the immediate aftermath of Maria, when they went to check on him, they were shocked to discover that he had died days before.   In the chaos that has gripped Puerto Rico following the storm, the family has struggled to get details about the circumstances of his death -- a sadly common byproduct of everything the storm turned upside-down. But the routine nature of his visit has the family wondering: Was his death due to fallout from the storm? We may never know.   What we do know is there are thousands of Josefinas, Jobitas and Estefanis here in Puerto Rico. They are too bed-ridden to leave their homes, or lack gasoline, or the ability to communicate with the outside world. They are mourning the loss of a loved one, or at the very least lamenting the terrible damage to their homes, their livelihoods, their way of life. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on  Facebook  and  Twitter .   These are the people we must help now, the people for whom we can make a huge difference as doctors, nurses, politicians, humans. We cannot take our attention off of what is happening here in Puerto Rico.   Know this. When you hear the death toll has increased from the current official number of 16, know that most every additional death need not have happened. They were preventable.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/health/gupta-puerto-rico-essay/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjYmfa27Mj6AhUjTDABHf24AXk4hAIQFnoECAMQAg&usg=AOvVaw01vvMsZpjtnKN31swBWIod,CNN,Liberal
91,Fuel Deliveries Finally Start To Arrive In Hurricane-Damaged Puerto Rico,By Gabriel Stargardter and Hugh Bronstein,10/3/17,"QUEBRADILLAS, Puerto Rico, Oct 3 (Reuters) - When Nestor Rodriguez saw Puma Energy fuel tanker 333 pull into Puerto Rico’s Quebradillas gas station at 12:37 p.m. on Monday, he bowed, raising his arms to the heavens.“I didn’t know if it would come today, or if wouldn’t,” he said as he filled up his tank, after a three-hour wait in the Caribbean sun. “When I saw that truck, I saw the glory. It was like seeing the Lord.”Two weeks after Hurricane Maria plowed into the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, cutting power and hobbling fuel distribution, finding gasoline and diesel has become a regular ordeal for the island’s 3.4 million residents, with no guarantee of success.Rodriguez, a 63-year-old retiree with a bright shock of white hair and beard, was one of the lucky few on Monday. He managed to purchase enough gasoline for both his car and his generator at home, where he cares for his 93-year-old father.Fuel scarcity has been one of the major headaches facing hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, which relies on gas shipped from the U.S. mainland.Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday reported progress in getting fuel supplies to the island, with 500,000 barrels of diesel and close to 1 million barrels of gasoline due to arrive in upcoming days.More than 720 of the island’s 1,100 gas stations were now up and running, Rossello added, which he said should allow more Puerto Ricans to operate generators and get around.Puma Energy, which is partially owned by commodities trading giant Trafigura, operates six terminals on the Caribbean island, and is working with the regional government to add more delivery trucks to its fleet.To assess the scale of the problem, Reuters joined a Puma delivery truck and its 49-year-old driver, Carlos Ramos, on a journey from Puma’s fuel distribution center in Bayamon, to a gas station in Quebradillas, some 55 miles (88 km) west.Ramos pulled out of the Bayamon facility at 10:38 a.m., escorted by two police vehicles responsible for protecting his precious 10,000-gallon (38,000 liter) load.Ramos said he had made more than 30 deliveries since Maria hit, and was often greeted with elation when he arrived at gas stations. At some, bands played to celebrate the truck’s arrival, while at others, he felt like a politician arriving at a rally.“If there’s no line when we arrive, there will be soon,” Ramos said. “It’s like putting out a little candy, and suddenly all the ants arrive.”‘THAT’S HAPPINESS’When Ramos’ eventually got to Quebradillas, nine cars were waiting. Within 10 minutes, the line had grown to 42 vehicles, with more arriving every few seconds.Luz Preciado, a 34-year-old housewife, said she had been waiting at a nearby station, when she saw Ramos’ truck drive by, and decided to give chase, despite the fact that her fuel gauge was blinking on empty.“When you see water, and when you see gas - that’s happiness in Puerto Rico right now,” said Preciado, who had slept overnight in her car with her two kids a few days earlier to be first in line for a morning fuel delivery. “Looking for gas is a full-time job right now.”Inside the gas station, 44-year-old Puma employee Waldemar Sosa said he normally sold about 1,400 gallons during a typical 6 a.m.-10 p.m. day. On Sunday, he said, he sold 12,000 gallons - all the fuel he had - in about 13 hours.Sosa said that with no cellphone coverage to phone in orders, the owner of the gas station was forced to travel to San Juan to write Puma a check for more fuel.“Without communication, this country doesn’t move,” he said.At 1:55 p.m., Juan Gonzalez rolled out of Sosa’s station, the first person to leave with a full tank since 9 p.m. the previous evening, to go eat a simple of lunch of sausage and rice with his elderly parents.“We’re going through a difficult moment,” he said, leaning out of his car window with a look of hard-won relief. “We’re in God’s hands.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-fuel-deliveries_n_59d338e6e4b048a44324bd5f,HuffPost,Liberal
92,Festering Disarray Greets Donald Trump As He Visits Puerto Rico,Hayley Miller,10/3/17,"President Donald Trump, who managed a golf club and resort on Puerto Rico before the property went bankrupt in 2015, may find the island unrecognizable when he pays a visit on Tuesday in the wake of two hurricanes.Hurricane Irma passed to the north of Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, pummeling the island with heavy winds and rain. Two weeks later, on Sept. 20, Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 5 hurricane ― the strongest storm to hit the island in over 80 years. Maria’s 155 mph sustained winds destroyed much of the island’s infrastructure, leaving more than 8,800 people still displaced as of Tuesday.Over 5,000 National Guard members have been deployed to assist with relief efforts, yet millions of Puerto Ricans are still without electricity and struggling to secure basic necessities such as water, food and fuel.The official death toll, which remains at 16, hasn’t been updated since Wednesday. But experts said they believe that number will rise as recovery efforts continue.More people likely died after the hurricanes struck because they haven’t been able to access necessary medication or insulin, said Dr. Armando Oliver, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.“I’ve heard stories, though nobody knows for sure if it’s true or not, that in some towns that are very deep inside the island ... somebody falls down a precipice and nobody is able to reach them,” Oliver told HuffPost. “They know the person is dead, but it’s not until someone goes there and says, ‘Hey, his pulse is zero’ that we can count them as dead.”Elderly communities have been hit especially hard in some areas, said Carmen Delia Sanchez, the director the Puerto Rico’s Office of the Attorney for People of Advanced Age.Lack of access to diesel fuel and broken generators are the major problems plaguing some of the island’s more than 700 nursing homes, she told HuffPost. “There are people in communities that are isolated and the government has not been able to reach them,” Sanchez said. “I don’t have the staff to visit all the nursing homes.”CommunicationPeople in search of a cell phone signal desperately drive around the island’s streets, which continue to be littered with downed trees and power lines. About 40 percent of telecommunications services and just 11.6 percent of cellular antennas have been repaired, according to a government website tracking the recovery.EnergyOver 3.1 million Puerto Ricans ― roughly 93 percent of the island ― were still without power on Tuesday morning. Officials have said it could take up to 10 months to restore electricity to some parts of the island.Receiving fuel remains a central priority for the U.S. territory, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Tuesday. Nearly 74 percent of the island’s gas stations are open, but logistical issues ― including impassable roadways and lack of truck drivers ― have hindered fuel and aid distribution efforts. Without electricity, most traffic lights aren’t able to function, which has caused major traffic jams, according to Isabel Rullan, director of San Juan-based nonprofit ConPRMetidos.Rullan, who spoke to HuffPost last week and provided an update about the situation on the ground Tuesday, said “things are starting to normalize” in some areas of the island, although other regions are still struggling greatly.“I’ve heard that the middle inland mountain parts of the island are still very much hurting,” Rullan said. “It’s still taking a long time for them to receive the supplies.”HospitalsDoctors have warned they don’t have the resources needed to provide adequate medical assistance. Just 10 hospitals have been reattached to the electrical grid, while dozens of others continue to rely on generators. Rullan said she’s heard “horror stories” about the state of some hospitals and nursing homes.“I’ve heard hospitals are very packed,” she said. “Some of their generators have broken down. ... They can’t get diesel fuel for generators and medical supplies.”AgriculturePuerto Rico’s farming industry suffered a major blow after Maria wiped out some 80 percent of the island’s crops. Carlos Flores Ortega, the island’s secretary of agriculture, estimated Maria caused a roughly $780 million loss in agricultural yields.All eyes are on Trump as he meets with Puerto Rican officials, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who has been a vocal critic of the federal government’s response to the island’s lingering humanitarian crisis.On Friday, Cruz slammed Elaine Duke, acting secretary of homeland security, over her enthusiastic praise of the federal government’s “amazing” response to the disaster. The mayor pleaded with Trump to step up the aid and recovery efforts. Trump responded the next day on Twitter by accusing Democrats of telling Cruz to “be nasty” to the president. He said Cruz had demonstrated “poor leadership” and claimed Puerto Rican “workers” just wanted “everything to be done for them.”At “a local level, they have to give us more help,” Trump told reporters Tuesday.But Rullan disputed Trump’s claims that the Puerto Rican community hasn’t stepped up enough.“Everyone is desperate to help,” Rullan said. “To say that locals are not working and that they are just waiting for help to come is very incorrect and misinformed.” U.S. Virgin IslandsTrump was initially considering a visit to the U.S. Virgin Islands as well, but decided instead to meet with USVI Gov. Kenneth Mapp in San Juan.The islands, which include St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John and constitute a U.S. territory like Puerto Rico, were also battered by hurricanes Irma and Maria. Most of the islands, which lie to the east of Puerto Rico, remain without power.Razed homes and businesses are still surrounded by broken glass and downed trees, said DaraMonifah Cooper, a 38-year-old radio station manager at the University of the Virgin Islands based in St. Thomas. Cell phone and internet service was just starting to return to some areas of St. Thomas on Tuesday ― weeks after Irma barreled by to the north.“It still looks like a mini Hiroshima,” Cooper told HuffPost. “I’ve driven around the island just once since both storms and it’s unrecognizable. It’s devastating.”The wreckage is even worse to the south on St. Croix, where almost all communication remains down, Cooper said. She has only been able to speak to her son, a college student at the university’s St. Croix campus, twice since Maria hit.“Getting things between the islands is challenging,” she said. “On St. Thomas, most people have been able to find their family members, but on St. Croix ... some people are still looking for family members.”The military has disbursed water and food, but it “isn’t enough,” Cooper said. Many Virgin Islands residents worry that other Americans will forget about their plight as time goes on.“We’re not a state, we can’t vote for president, but we’re definitely all American here,” Cooper said. “People are trying their best to keep their spirits up. ...

89,Puerto Rico Is A Lesson In Community,"Mark Curry, Contributor",10/3/17,"“I want to help. What more can I do?”Those words ring in my ears like a gunshot. It has only been 12 days since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico ― my island home since 2012 ― and, once again, I am astounded by the generosity and selflessness of the people here. They look for any opportunity to help, setting aside personal struggles to help their island community.Those who have just lost their homes offer their neighbors the last of their drinking water; someone with only a 1/8 tank of gas offers to wait in 10-hour fuel lines to help an elderly friend, forgoing their turn; and the lucky few fortunate enough to have their roofs spared from the destruction of 140-mile-per-hour winds have graciously taken in many more hurricane-displaced friends than their homes allow.And, amidst all this, they think to call me and ask how they can help. Time and time again Puerto Rico’s openness, kindness and sense of community leave me speechless. The response to Hurricane Maria is no exception.This is not to say that we have the situation completely under control. We don’t. We need help right now and cannot wait on bureaucratic delays or partisan politics. The clock is ticking. It is a matter of life and death as our infrastructure fails, our ill and elderly run out of medication and vital drinking water and food remains stranded on shipping containers in docks across the island.Those of us in Puerto Rico who lost our homes, our businesses, or even loved ones are frustrated by the federal governmental response to Maria. While Fortaleza’s (Puerto Rico’s territorial government) response was swift, local resources are profoundly inadequate to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. Puerto Rico’s government is doing as much as they can with the resources available, but it simply isn’t enough. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, recently appointed by the Pentagon to run point between Puerto Rico, FEMA and the DOD, should be commended – although he’s only been on the job for a few days, the improvements are evident. But this doesn’t make up for the slow initial response by the federal government. Puerto Rico was forgotten in the critical hours following Maria.Sadly, while we await a relief bill in Congress, some elected leaders have chosen to waste valuable time and energy bickering on social media. We don’t have time for partisan politicking and petty insults. Our leaders will be judged by what they do to help Puerto Rico, much more than by what they say or tweet. Just like the people of this island, our elected leaders must come together as a community, set aside their differences, and figure out how they can help. Too many lives depend upon it.Rebuilding Puerto Rico is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. I remain hopeful that, just like the people of this beautiful island, America’s political leadership will view this crisis not as an opportunity to divide us or score small political points, but as an opportunity to come together and help.And although we are all busy repairing our homes, tending to our families, and getting back to work, let us be driven by my neighbors’ examples and ask Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, and President Donald Trump: “I want to help. What more can I do?”Originally published at NotiCel.com",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-is-a-lesson-in-community_b_59d3885fe4b092b22a8e396c,HuffPost,Liberal
159,Puerto Rico's nightmare recovery,Patrick Gillespie,10/2/17," ""I don't want to live here anymore."" Eyleen Gonzalez, all of 18 years of age, uttered that phrase without hesitating.  Gonzalez's house in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, was  destroyed by Hurricane Maria  nearly two weeks ago.  Since then, everyone in her hometown has lived without electricity. Only a quarter of its 80,000 residents have running water. About half of gas stations in town are open, with long queues stretching blocks. Most supermarkets are open but rationing food.  The destruction in Toa Baja is the rule, not the exception, in Puerto Rico, where the recovery has moved at a glacial pace, according to over a dozen interviews with residents, local relief workers and small-town mayors across the island.   Federal officials and Puerto Rican government leaders stress the recovery efforts are ""united."" But things took a divisive twist Saturday when  President Donald Trump lambasted the mayor of San Juan , Carmen Yulin Cruz, for ""poor leadership.""  Trump visits Puerto Rico on Tuesday, and he may get a sense of why the  recovery has been a nightmare  for many of the island's 3.4 million US citizens.  ""My people are suffering. This is a disaster,"" says Carlos Mendez, the mayor of Aguadilla in western Puerto Rico.   Overwhelming destruction The Port of San Juan, where much of the humanitarian aid is arriving, doesn't have enough truck drivers. Even if it did, many trucks don't have enough diesel fuel to deliver food, water and other essentials. There's little cell service for those with the aid to communicate with towns, drivers and locals. Banks can't get enough armored trucks to deliver cash too.  On top of all that, roads are marred with fallen trees -- or the road just doesn't exist anymore. In one town,  residents strung a cable across a river  to ford it in knee-deep water because the bridge connecting the two sides had been washed a football field's length downriver.  Meanwhile,  hospitals and food banks are running low on fuel  for their generators to keep the lights on and preserve fruits, veggies and meat.  Federal officials have acknowledged the recovery hasn't been ideal.  ""It's not nearly as fast as any of us want,"" John Rabin, acting regional administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said at a press conference.   Puerto Ricans spend much of their time now waiting in line. On Sunday, one ATM line had several dozen people waiting two hours to withdraw a maximum of $40.  It's worse at gas stations: Hundreds of people camp out in their cars overnight, risking their safety so they don't lose their place in line. About 65% of gas stations were open on the island by Sunday, according to Puerto Rico's government.   The cash crunch  is exacerbated because many businesses' credit card machines are still down, so they can only take hard currency.  ""I'm overwhelmed,"" said Ana Ramos, tears streaming down her face as she waited in line for gas with only $20 in her hand. ""I have to wait in line at the ATM because I don't have any more money.""  Incomplete response The federal government, initially led by FEMA, has  tried to respond to the island's damage , which Rabin, the regional administrator, describes as ""catastrophic."" Three-star Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan was tapped by Trump earlier this week to spearhead recovery efforts.   There are over 10,000 federal workers on the island from dozens of federal departments and agencies. FEMA says it has reached all of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities and delivered a million meals, along with 2 million liters of water, to 11 distribution centers on the island.  But herein lies the rub: A breakdown of communication still leaves some towns empty handed.  Betito Marquez, the mayor of Toa Baja, an impoverished town near San Juan, went to a FEMA distribution center at 5 p.m. on Friday. It was closed and he couldn't pick up supplies.  Mendez, the mayor of Aguadilla, told CNN he's been  driving across the island , two hours each way, every morning to pick up FEMA aid in San Juan.  ""They're not coming here, I'm going there,"" Mendez said. President Trump has dismissed any problems in his administration's response as fake news. Instead, he points to longstanding issues, like  Puerto Rico's debt debacle or its infrastructure problems . The island's slow recovery may exacerbate another problem Trump isn't talking about: An exodus of people off Puerto Rico and to places like Texas and Florida.  Over 400,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to the mainland United States since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center. Puerto Rico now has 3.4 million residents.  Many left because Puerto Rico suffers from high unemployment, rising taxes and few job opportunities outside of tourism.  Eyleen Gonzalez, the young woman who said she doesn't want to live on the only island she's ever called home, said she had been on the fence about applying for college in the mainland.  Maria made up Gonzalez's decision.  ""I want to leave for the rest of my life,"" said Gonzalez. ""I don't want to know anything about Puerto Rico.""

94,Will Puerto Rico Be The Prequel To Global Post-Climate Change Dystopia?,"Miles Mogulescu, Contributor",10/2/17,"In Puerto Rico, we may be seeing a prequel of what a post-climate change dystopian world may look like, and it’s truly terrifying. I hope I’m wrong.Here’s an imagined picture of what Puerto Rico could look like in a few weeks or a few months unless rescue efforts are ramped up quickly:Tens or hundreds of thousands of American citizens sick or dying from contaminated water; mass starvation because fresh food and water can’t reach those who need it; a breakdown in social order, as law enforcement officers are unable to even get to work, because they’re trying to take care of their own families, or because shattered transportation infrastructure prevents them from reaching remote parts of the island; maybe even roving gangs of young people stealing food, water, fuel and medicine to save their own families; makeshift refugee camps fighting other refugees for scarce resources; and the armed forces trying desperately to restore order.Meanwhile, hedge funds and investment banks holding Puerto Rican debt foreclose on the territory’s assets.Not a pretty picture. Think “Lord of the Flies” meets “Wall Street.”Welcome to DystopiaIf you’ve ever read any dystopian novels or seen dystopian movies, this is often what the post apocalyptic world is portrayed as—a small wealthy elite revels behind gilded walls, while out in the hinterlands, most people struggle for survival, often pitted against each other in armed gangs and tribes.Only 10 days after Puerto Rico’s second storm of the century in a week, San Juan’s Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz pleaded, “People are dying in this country. I am begging, begging anyone that can hear us, to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy.”To which President Trump tweeted back insults to the besieged mayor.Even if a dystopian scenario doesn’t fully emerge, it will be months before power, water and transportation are restored to much of the island. Lawlessness is likely to grow. And Puerto Rico faces the threat of bankruptcy from Wall Street banks on top of it. Puerto Rico may never fully recover.And we must ask, is the number and intensity of recent storms in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean the result of global climate change warming the seas? If so, is the physical and social devastation of Puerto Rico a precursor to what more and more of the world will be experiencing.What about poverty-stricken Bangladesh which is considered one of the two most vulnerable countries to climate change, which could result in the death and displacement of millions? Or low-lying American cities like Houston, Miami, New Orleans or even New York? What about much of the American West, where flames from massive forest fires are growing and claiming increasing amounts of territory?The True Costs of Climate ChangeRepublicans and the donor class who finances them often claim that even if man-made climate change exists, it would cost the economy too much to resist it, much less roll it back. But what’s the economic, human and social cost of devastating storms making key populated areas all but unlivable and threatening the foundations of organized civilization?In the short run, President Trump must check his narcissistic ego, realize that Puerto Rico’s crisis is not about him, and mobilize every part of the U.S. government to save Puerto Rico from dystopia.If we can occupy Iraq or Afghanistan to try to create order, then we can send the full resources of the Federal government—civil and military—to defend Puerto Rico and save lives. At the same time, the Federal government must relieve Puerto Rico of its Wall Street debt so it’s not denied the financial resources to rebuild.But then it’s time to take our head out of the sand and realize that climate change is an existential threat to civilized life in the United States and around the world. It will take a concerted effort and resources from the U.S. and every other developed economy to halt and reverse climate change, and build a sustainable economy. Otherwise, more and more parts of America and the world could soon look like the emerging dystopia of post-hurricane Puerto Rico.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
161,"Puerto Rico governor: More needed, but feds have answered our calls",Jason Hanna and Madison Park,10/1/17," Much more work must be done to meet Puerto Rico's critical humanitarian needs after Hurricane Maria, the US territory's top official said Saturday, while also emphasizing that the federal government is fulfilling his every request -- striking a conciliatory tone minutes after President Donald Trump  lambasted a mayor  who criticized Washington's response. ""We need to do a lot more in order for us to get out of the emergency,"" Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said in San Juan. ""But the other thing that's also true is that the administration has answered and has complied with our petitions in an expedited manner."" Eleven days after Hurricane Maria began to pound Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, millions in the US commonwealth remain without regular electricity service, and many have limited access to gas, cash and running water. At least 16 people died there as a result of the storm, the government has said. Earlier Saturday, Trump -- who plans to visit the island Tuesday -- used Twitter to criticize San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and the ""leadership ability"" of some in Puerto Rico who ""want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort."" Yulín Cruz earlier had criticized the distribution of aid and said the feds needed to do more. Rosselló, while updating reporters on recovery efforts, trod carefully on the back-and-forth. ""I don't feel that (Trump's) message was sent in general,"" Rosselló said. ""I am committed to collaborating with everybody. This is a point where we can't look at small differences. We can't establish differences based on politics."" Rosselló acknowledged many of the island's 3.4 million citizens could leave for good, and more people could die, if conditions don't improve soon.  With most of the power transmission grid destroyed, more than 95% of customers are without regular electricity service. Only 10.7% of the island's cell phone towers are working. People are waiting for hours in line at gas stations and thinly supplied grocery stores. Some communities are isolated by phone outages and blocked and damaged roads. ""My invitation ... is to recognize what the important issue is: helping the people of Puerto Rico. Everything else is fodder to the side,"" he said. Rain is aggravating the situation and on Saturday night, authorities began to evacuate several hundred residents who live very close to a stressed dam in northwestern Puerto Rico. Trump: Some leaders 'want everything to be done for them' Trump's Twitter attack on Yulín Cruz came a day after she stepped up criticism of the federal response, saying aid wasn't being distributed efficiently. Wearing a black shirt that read, ""Help Us, We Are Dying,"" she appeared Friday night on CNN to say the situation was desperate. ""People are drinking out of creeks here in San Juan,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""You have people in buildings, and they're becoming caged in their own buildings -- old people, retired people that don't have any electricity."" ""We're dying here. We truly are dying here. I keep saying it: SOS. If anyone can hear us; Mr. Trump can hear us, let's just get it over with and get the ball rolling,"" she said. Saturday morning, Trump responded. ""The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,"" the President tweeted. ""Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job,"" his tweets read. Yulín Cruz told Cooper on Saturday night that she is not a Democrat, though she shares some of their values. ""I have no time for small politics or for comments that don't really add to the situation here,"" she said. Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told CNN on Saturday that recovery efforts hinge on good communication and coordinated efforts. ""The bottom line is we've had a joint field office established for numerous days in San Juan and what we need is for the good mayor to make her way to the joint field office and get plugged into what's going on,"" he said when asked about the President's tweets about Yulín Cruz. Long said he was focused on getting aid sent to 11 FEMA distribution centers throughout the commonwealth and getting more set up. Long said he will be in Puerto Rico for several days early next week. Cruz told Cooper on Saturday that she works out of a building that has two FEMA envoys and she feels as though there is sufficient cooperation. Cruz and her family are staying at the Coliseum in San Juan, along with more than 600 people. They're sleeping in cots and eating the same food as everyone else after their house flooded. Struggling for basics For many in Puerto Rico, trying to get the basics, like fuel, has become a grueling, all-day affair. More than 710 of the island's roughly 1,110 gas stations were working as of Saturday morning, according to the Puerto Rican government's  website for information on the recovery . But stations often are closing in the evening, ahead of a government-mandated 9 p.m. curfew designed to limit looting. And lines in the day are long. In Loíza, residents waited for more than 10 hours Friday for gas. The town's deputy mayor, Luis Escobar, summed it up as a broken chain. ""No fuel, no work, no money.""  Without gas or transport, people can't get to their jobs. Without work, there is no money to buy necessities. After spending an entire day waiting for fuel, the next days are spent trying to get food and other basic supplies, residents say. There's also a cash scarcity. Many of Puerto Rico's businesses, supermarkets and gas stations will accept only cash because credit card systems are down. At least half of all bank branches remain shuttered, in part because they can't get enough armored trucks with gas, or truck drivers, to deliver cash safely. Some bank branches are limiting the amount of daily withdrawals. All phone landlines working; cell service largely down Recovery efforts this weekend may be hampered by rain. Puerto Rico is under a  flash flood watch  until late Sunday, as between 2 and 4 inches of rain could fall, the National Weather Service said. Low-lying areas are at risk for flooding as drainage pumps aren't functioning at full capacity. ""(The rain will be) a problem -- a lot of the rivers and streams in Puerto Rico have yet to recede to normal levels,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said Saturday. Rosselló and FEMA officials gave the following updates on recovery efforts Saturday and Sunday: • Close to a million gallons of gasoline and half a million gallons of diesel fuel are expected to arrive in coming days.  • All phone landlines are now working and 36% of the people have phone service. • The government still is in the process of buying a few thousand crates of private-sector goods -- such as food meant for grocery stores -- that have been sitting idle at the Port of San Juan. Companies that can't access the port and deliver the goods will be forced to sell the items to the commonwealth, which will distribute them, Rosselló said.  • Airline service is being restored, with 36 passenger flights expected Sunday in Puerto Rico. • About 8,800 people remain in 139 shelters. • About half of the island's customers have regular water service. • Millions of meals and liters of water are being sent from ports to 11 distribution points throughout the island, where local governments can pick them up for distribution. In some cases, FEMA or other agencies are delivering by helicopter to isolated communities. More than 200 containers from FEMA were distributed on Saturday, the governor said.  •  Fifty-one of the island's 69 hospitals are open. Nine of the open hospitals have regular electricity service; the rest are powered by generators. Of dialysis centers, 46 of 48 are operating. • The Army Corps of Engineers has begun a mission to restore the power grid. About 6,400 Department of Defense personnel are now in Puerto Rico. Homes and streets still flooded About 45 miles from San Juan, in the town of Florida, fish swim in the streets that are still flooded after the hurricane. Though the town is nowhere near the coast, the storm backed up a nearby creek, causing the flooding and forcing families from their homes.  8 numbers that show how Maria has laid waste to Puerto Rico Despite the total collapse of utilities, residents are cleaning up and clearing debris from roads.  Officials from FEMA arrived in town Friday, and residents peppered them with questions: When will supplies come? How long will it take? ""FEMA's not going to forget about this community,"" the agency's Caroline Cuddy told CNN's Ivan Watson. ""FEMA's not going to forget about the needs that they have, and we're going to work with our people back in our field office in San Juan about what we're going to do.""

162,Trump sent 18 tweets on Puerto Rico on Saturday. And made things a whole lot worse,Chris Cillizza,10/1/17," In an 11-hour period beginning at 7:19 a.m. and ending at 6:46 p.m. Saturday, the President of the United States ripped off 18 -- yes, 18! -- tweets dealing with the dire situation in Puerto Rico following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria. What's more remarkable than Donald Trump -- aka the commander in chief, aka the most most powerful person in the country -- tapping out 18 tweets on a single subject in less than 12 hours is the tone of those tweets: Negative, defensive and dark. It all began with Trump's slashing attack on San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who has become the face of the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico -- thanks in no small part to  her interview Friday on CNN's ""New Day""  in which she angrily denounced attempts by the Trump White House to present the situation in Puerto Rico as a ""good news story."" Trump, already worried about the perception that he and his administration have responded inadequately to the situation, responded to Yulín Cruz the only way he knows how: Viciously. ""The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,""  Trump began just after 7 a.m. ET . ""Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,""  he   added . ""They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job."" At a time of crisis for more than 3 million Americans living in Puerto Rico, their President decided to pick a fight with a local official due to her frustration with the recovery efforts. Rather than send a tweet urging patience (or maybe not tweeting at all!), Trump decided the best course of action was to go after Yulín Cruz and ""others in Puerto Rico"" for their allegedly poor job in dealing with Hurricane Maria. The words Trump used are telling. ""They want everything to be done for them,"" he tweeted. ""They""? You mean the millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico? And the not-so-subtle suggestion of laziness in Trump's tweets is just more of the same racially coded language that the President has trafficked in since the day he announced his campaign. Had Trump sent only those three tweets hitting Yulín Cruz, it would have been a bad -- but not atypical -- day for him. But, he didn't stop there. Not even close. Trump spent the next eight(!) hours tweeting a series of attacks against the so-called ""fake news"" media for allegedly misrepresenting the actions of his administration in Puerto Rico.  ""Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to 'get Trump,'""  he tweeted in one . ""Not fair to FR or effort!"" ""The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!,""  went another. Trump provided no evidence for his claims. Or, really, explained what he meant by them. CNN, for its part, has provided significant coverage of the recovery efforts -- highlighting both stories of inspiration and the real struggles of many on the island to cope with the lack of electricity and increasing shortages of water and food. A number of correspondents are on the ground in Puerto Rico -- including Anderson Cooper and Bill Weir -- documenting the situation firsthand. None of that comes even close to Trump's claim that the news networks are working to ""disparage our great First Responders"" or that the media is ""doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers."" What Trump is doing -- in his attacks on Yulín Cruz and the media -- is trying to divide the country as a way to deflect blame for his administration's performance. ""They"" are lazy and want everything done for them. ""They"" are being nasty because Democrats told them to. ""They"" aren't rooting for our first responders. ""They"" are trying to convince people that our soldiers aren't doing a good job. Trump's willingness to divide, to turn every situation in which he is questioned or criticized into an ""us"" vs ""them"" is well documented by now. The 2016 election was an 18-month master class in how to divide the country for your own political gain. Trump's handling of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and his deliberate decision to pick a fight with (mostly black) NFL players over the national anthem illustrate that same perpetual need to divide. That default divisiveness makes Trump different than every person who has held the office before him. For the 43 previous presidents, their ultimate goal was to find ways to remind people in the country of our common humanity, to take the high road, to appeal to our better angels. Many of them missed that mark -- often badly -- but it was always their North Star. It is not for Trump. Not close. For Trump, the lone goal is winning at all costs. If that means attacking the mayor of San Juan even as Puerto Rico faces a historic recovery challenge, so be it. If it means blaming Puerto Rico's debt and infrastructure issues even as people are desperately searching for their loved ones, well, that's just how it goes. If it means trying to build the media up as a scapegoat to cover up a slower-than-ideal response to Maria's aftermath? Consider it done! 18 tweets. 11 hours. Full of blame, anger and victimhood. Totally devoid of hope, inspiration or unity.  This is Trumpism.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/01/politics/trump-tweets-puerto-rico/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiB_7Sq6Mj6AhUgVzABHdmFDnU43AEQFnoECAIQAg&usg=AOvVaw3HY_L3poVjnGTvcwbkbPLl,CNN,Liberal
160,Puerto Rico public schools may not reopen for weeks,Ralph Ellis,10/1/17," Twelve days after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, officials said only 5% of the island has electricity and its schools are not close to reopening. Julia Kelleher, Puerto Rico's secretary of education, told CNN on Sunday that some public schools might not resume classes until October 16 because of storm damage, though decisions will be made on a regional basis. There are 1,113 public schools and a student population of 350,000 on the island but only 400 schools have been assessed for damage, she said.  ""I have come up with a target date of October 16th,"" Kelleher said. ""We used to make system-wide decisions before, but this time we're going to allow the different regions to make their own decision as to when they can reopen."" Schools started classes August 14 but students have already missed two weeks because of Hurricane Irma, which lashed the island only days before Maria hit. The report on schools came one day after President Trump took to Twitter to criticize the leadership of island officials, especially the mayor of San Juan. Trump, who plans to visit the island Tuesday,  criticized San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz  and the ""leadership ability"" of some in Puerto Rico who ""want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.""  Cruz earlier had criticized the distribution of aid to the island and said federal authorities needed to do more. In addition to widespread power outages, many people have limited access to gas, cash and running water. FEMA said Sunday it has expanded its delivery of food and water throughout Puerto Rico, though officials stressed that many people still lack the essentials. The federal emergency agency has delivered food and water to all 79 municipalities in Puerto Rico, Alejandro De La Campa, FEMA federal coordinating officer in Puerto Rico, told reporters Sunday. He said 1 million liters of water and 1 million meals had been delivered as of Saturday. However, he said some isolated areas of these municipalities may not have received the commodities, partly because lack of communication systems has hampered distribution efforts.  Officials   provided an update Sunday morning on recovery efforts and the island's infrastructure: Water.  41% of the island has potable water.  Food and water delivery.  Eleven regional staging areas are open for food and water distribution but officials hope that number will grow to 25 in coming days. About half the grocery stores are operating. Electricity.  5% of the island has power. The Army Corps of Engineers has begun a mission to repair the power grid, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. Gasoline.  More than 710 of the island's roughly 1,110 gas stations were working as of Saturday morning, but lines were long and some stations were closing ahead of the 9 p.m. curfew.  Fuel delivery.  Over the next few days, close to a million gallons of gasoline and half a million gallons of diesel fuel will arrive, the governor said. As of Sunday, 470,000  barrels of gasoline were in Puerto Rico.  Communications.  36% of people now have phone service in Puerto Rico, most in the northeast part of the island. All the island's landlines are operating but only about 11% of the cell towers are operational. Shelters:  8,800 people remain in 139 shelters. Rossello saw this as an improvement because 500 shelters were operating 10 days ago. Air travel.  39 passenger flights were expected on Sunday in Puerto Rico, which has a maximum efficiency of 60 flights. Medical care.  51 of 69 hospitals are running in some capacity now, along with 46 of 48 dialysis centers. Islanders receiving benefits under Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance program who have been displaced by the hurricanes can apply for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA announced Sunday.  The policy will remain in effect through October 31. Hurricane Maria struck as a category 4 storm on September 20. At least 16 people on the US commonwealth died, the government has said.

164,Teamsters organize truckers to move supplies in Puerto Rico,Jackie Wattles,9/30/17,"Major U.S. labor unions are organizing truck drivers to help with relief efforts in Puerto Rico as the island continues to grapple with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria last week.  The Teamsters union and the AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 50 unions, are working together to recruit truckers to travel   to Puerto Rico and help distribute a stockpile of relief supplies     Thousands of  shipping containers  full of food, water, and medicines were sitting unused at Puerto Rico's Port of San Juan.   Relief workers haven't been able to distribute the goods, in part because only about 20% of Puerto Rico's truck drivers have reported back to work since Hurricane Maria swept through, according to a representative for Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló.   On top of that, Puerto Rico has a shortage of diesel fuel, which is needed to power the semi-trucks. Downed power lines and debris still litter roadways, blocking routes. Even contacting local drivers is an issue because cell service blackouts still cover the majority of the island.    Teamsters spokesman Galen Munro told CNN that the union hopes to get more drivers on the ground next week.    Munro said the union has heard from more than 100 truckers who have offered to help, and The Teamsters is working to vet those drivers and ensure they have the proper licenses and availability.   But The Teamsters said it's still facing the other logistical issues that have held up cargo distribution.   ""At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers,"" the union said Friday.   Eleven days after Hurricane Maria hit, Puerto Rico still looks like a war zone.   Supermarkets are rationing supplies, while banks are running low on cash. Only about half of the island's gas stations are functioning.   The federal relief efforts in Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory and home to 3.4 million Americans, have become a point of contention between President Trump and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.    Trump on Puerto Rico: They want everything done for them    Yulín Cruz pushed back against Trump's assertion this week that relief work in Puerto Rico was a ""good news story.""   ""This is, damn it, this is not a good news story,"" Yulín Cruz told CNN. ""This is a 'people are dying' story. This is a 'life-or-death' story. This is, 'there's a truckload of stuff that cannot be taken to people' story.""   On Saturday, Trump used Twitter to criticize her ""leadership ability"" and claimed Puerto Ricans ""want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.""   Yulín Cruz responded to the tweets in an interview with MSNBC on Saturday: ""I was asking for help,"" she said. ""I wasn't saying anything nasty about the President.""    --CNN's Patrick Gillespie, Rafael Romo, Maria Santana and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.

163,White House statements on Puerto Rico clash with ground reports,Eric Levenson,9/30/17," Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke faced harsh backlash after saying the Trump administration's recovery effort in Puerto Rico is a "" good news story ."" ""Damn it, this is not a good news story,"" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz responded. ""This is a people-are-dying story. This is a life-or-death story."" Since Hurricane Maria slammed into the US territory as a Category 4 hurricane earlier this month, much of the island has been devastated -- leaving millions of Americans without electricity and water, and limited access to gas and other vital supplies. Duke's comments weren't the first time the White House's statements about the recovery effort contradicted ground reports. This week, federal officials and locals clashed on such issues as medical care facilities, aid shipments and the availability of cash. Critics say the White House has been  slow to respond  and is portraying the situation in Puerto Rico as better than it really is. Here's a snapshot of what the White House is saying compared to what people there are seeing and experiencing. Hospitals and nursing homes White House:  In Puerto Rico, 44 of 69 hospitals were ""fully operational"" as of Thursday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.  By Thursday   night, White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said that 51 hospitals had met the standard of being able to ""see, treat and admit"" patients.  However, he clarified that the three-pronged standard for hospitals included many using emergency diesel fuel, which he admitted was ""not necessarily an ideal condition."" Ground Reports:  Because power and communication lines still remain out for much of the island, hospitals rely on diesel fuel -- already in short supply -- and have trouble contacting and coordinating patient care. CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta saw those hospitals' struggles firsthand. At a shelter an hour outside of San Juan, a  woman named Josefina Alvarez, who suffers from diabetes, was in a dire situation. She had an infection and no insulin, water or food. No ambulance could take her to a hospital, so Gupta and his team volunteered to drive her to a nearby clinic. ""There are probably thousands of patients who are in similar shelters with no power, no water, no medications, no way out. There are probably thousands more who are still in their homes and haven't even been able to get to a shelter,"" he said. ""She's just one example of what's happening here."" Speaking on CNN's The Situation Room on Thursday, Gupta said that many hospitals listed as operational had no satellite phones, no access to medications, and were unable to admit patients. ""We're seeing diesel fuel being promised for a few hours at a time as opposed to anything that's going to be more sustainable for them. And as you might imagine, it's very hard to run a hospital that way,"" he said. ""It's hard to take care of patients if you say, 'Look, we have six hours of fuel left. We're not sure if we'll get more fuel after that.'"" Because available diesel fuel was prioritized for hospitals, nursing homes had major issues as well, Mayor Cruz said. ""Most of our nursing homes have people that have an inability to move, so they're stuck in the 14th floor, they have no water, they have no food, they -- most of them are insulin-dependent,"" she said. Insulin-dependent patients are ""going crazy for ice"" to keep their medical supplies cold, Cruz said, while other patients haven't had their scheduled dialysis or chemotherapy in days. Delivering food and water White House:  President Donald Trump has tweeted several times over the past few days that food and water are "" on way ,"" "" on site "" or "" delivered "" to Puerto Rico.  The Federal Aviation Administration supported the restoration of services to all eight commercial airports in Puerto Rico, FEMA said on Friday. In addition, five of six FEMA-priority seaports are open or open with restrictions, the  Department of Defense  said Thursday. Ground Reports:  Initially, FEMA was limited in its ability to deliver aid because of closed or damaged ports. ""We were limited by a damaged air traffic control system, we were limited by airports that weren't operational,""  FEMA administrator Brock Long said Thursday. ""We were limited by ports that weren't operational. Now as those are coming back up, we are increasing capacity."" In recent days, food, water and other supplies have reached the ports. But because of damaged infrastructure -- impassable roads, non-operational seaports and airports, and a lack of communication lines -- getting those supplies to people in need has proved much more difficult. ""We're getting commodities to Puerto Rico,"" said Long. ""The question is, how do we get it to the last mile?"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said delivering aid from ports to communities is the main problem officials are facing. ""They have got to get that aid moving to the right places. To do that, you need to restore roads, a bare minimum of power, you need a bare minimum of communication. You need a logistical chain,"" Rubio said. ""There's a lot of food coming in, a lot of water, a lot of medical assistance. But if that medical assistance is sitting at the port, it's theoretically in Puerto Rico, but it's not enough. You've got to get it from the port to the people who need it. And that's the problem."" Delivering aid to some areas will be more difficult than to others. In San Lorenzo, a 45-minute-drive from San Juan, a bridge over a rushing river was destroyed by flash floods. Now residents cross the waters while holding onto a scavenged cable. John Rabin, acting regional administrator of FEMA Region II, said the agency has established 11 distribution points at various parts of the island. They have delivered around 1.1 million liters of water and almost a million meals. Mayor Cruz, of San Juan, said these distribution centers ""need to be much closer and need to provide a lot more."" She drove 30 miles from San Juan to a distribution center to pick up three pallets of water and food. ""Wouldn't it be more logical in terms of logistical support to get 21 pallets of water and 21 pallets of food, whatever you're going to give me, give me for a week's worth?"" she said. Making cash available White House:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the federal government was acting quickly to meet Puerto Rico's cash shortage. ""For the last two days, we've been very involved in figuring out how we can get major amounts of cash to Puerto Rico. I can tell you we made two giant cash shipments,"" Mnuchin said. Ground Reports:  With electricity still widely out, many merchants are not accepting credit cards, making a cash infusion increasingly necessary for residents who need to purchase food, medicine, gas and other supplies. At least half of the bank branches in Puerto Rico are still not open, according to the Association of Banks of Puerto Rico. Stand-alone ATMs -- from the airport to wealthy neighborhoods -- are out of cash. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Friday that 90 bank branches are now open throughout the island, though CNN reports they are operating under severe restrictions. Many people are waiting in lines for hours to access ATMs with no guarantee they'll be able to withdraw cash. Tom Tarbox waited an hour in line at an ATM near the beach in San Juan on Wednesday in sweltering heat. The line stretched around the FirstBank. Customers used umbrellas to shield themselves from the beating sun. It wasn't even his bank, but it had cash and that's all that mattered.  Tarbox, a retiree from Connecticut who has lived in San Juan for 20 years, said he was worried most about running out of diesel fuel for his generator. The long queues for food, gas and cash convince him that the federal government's response has been too little, too late.  ""The feeling is that the response of the administration has been too slow in getting equipment and things down here, including cash,"" Tarbox said, with another 15 people in line ahead of him. ""There is sort of a hoarding, panic mentality.""

165,Daddy Yankee goes where Uncle Sam isn't,Patrick Gillespie and Leyla Santiago,9/30/17," Eyleen Gonzalez lost everything in her home after Hurricane Maria.  She has no running water. No electricity. Barely any cell service to communicate with family. Her house is ""destroyed."" Her only valuable possession left is her puppy, Lena.  But for just a moment on Saturday, Gonzalez forgot about life, its worries and Puerto Rico's long road ahead.  ""Daddy Yankee! Oh my God!"" she said, beaming with a smile. ""It's exciting to see and believe that he's helping the people in Puerto Rico because not everyone has a heart like him.""  Daddy Yankee, the Puerto Rican pop star who co-sang the wildly famous song ""Despacito,"" flexed his celebrity power in more ways than one Saturday. Feeding families by the thousands The musician, whose real name is Ramon Luis Ayala, donated $100,000 to the Food Bank of Puerto Rico, with that amount confirmed by the food bank and Daddy Yankee's representatives.  The money provided food to roughly 9,000 families in Toa Baja, an impoverished town of 80,000 people near Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan.  Hurricane Maria pummeled Toa Baja. Leafless trees surround the low-lying town. Not a single household has electricity. Only 25% has running water and 50% of gas stations are back up and running. Most of the supermarkets have reopened but are rationing food, according to Toa Baja Mayor Betito Marquez.  Each family on Saturday received 59 pounds of food, not including rations of water too. The box of food included rice, pasta, tuna, beans, beef and milk. Food Bank officials say it's enough to feed a family of four for a week. Many in Toa Baja had been living day to day, waiting in long lines for food and water.   The box of food meant the world to Casandra Rodriguez, a housewife and mother of two whose husband is an electrician. Like many in Toa Baja, she's living without basic necessities and says her home was ""completely destroyed"" by Hurricane Maria.  ""Thanks to God, we've received enough support,"" says Casandra, tearing up with the box in her hands. ""I lost everything.""  Daddy Yankee pulled off another feat earlier Saturday morning.  Fuel for food Food Bank Director Ivonne Bernard was worried around 10 a.m. before the pop star arrived.  She only had two hours of diesel gas left to power the generator that was refrigerating 25,000 pounds of food. The Food Bank's frozen food section was choked full of mangoes, pork, lettuce, pineapple and a variety of other items.  Bernard insisted: The Food Bank had the money to pay for diesel. She had also reached out to Puerto Rican government officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. They couldn't tell her when, or if, diesel was coming.  ""We have the money, but they're not supplying, they're not bringing it,"" Bernard lamented around Saturday morning. If the food bank ran out of fuel, ""I would feel very sad, because we're not going to be able to continue to provide relief to the Puerto Rican people,"" she said. Then, Daddy Yankee arrived. As he toured the food bank, Bernard mentioned the issue. The musician immediately alerted his entourage. They got on the phone right away.  Within minutes, they told her 200 gallons of diesel fuel was on its way to the food bank. Bernard said that would be enough for four days.  ""We got the diesel! We got the diesel!"" the pop star proclaimed at the Food Bank. ""We can't wait for the government.""  FEMA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/30/us/daddy-yankee-delivers-to-puerto-rico/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjo_6Sg7cj6AhU2ZjABHUdAAvQ4jgIQFnoECAgQAg&usg=AOvVaw3r1MaUKtkInb4DR1IQbcDQ,CNN,Liberal
95,Donald Trump Is Using Puerto Rico's Crisis To Push His War Against The Media,Carla Herreria Russo,9/30/17,"While residents of Puerto Rico struggle to get access to basic necessities like potable water and food, PresidentDonald Trump has launched a full-fledged attack on the news media and, even more concerning, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico’s largest city, made severalemotional pleas this week to the media, tearfully begging for the government to provide more aid to the islands residents and for private citizens to make calls to Congress or to donate money or time.Cruz tried to paint a picture of the island’s devastation: She described people who wereforced to drink from streams and dehydrated senior citizens who were trapped in sweltering apartment buildings which she called, “human cages.”“We are dying here, and I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles,” Cruz said Friday. “Mayday! We are in trouble.”Trump responded to Cruz’s cries for help in the way he typically does when he reads something that makes his administration look bad: He launched a Twitter rant against Cruz and then blamed“fake news.”By nearly all accounts, Cruz’s depiction of Puerto Rico’s need for more aid is clear. As of Friday evening, 95 percent of the Puerto Rico’s population was still without power, and more than half of the island had no access to drinking water, according to the Department of Defense. News reporters on the scene describe dwindling diesel fuel supply and struggling hospitals that are relying on generators to function. Rescuers have yet to reach barrios, or neighborhoods, in the center of the island, Jaime Barlucea, mayor of Adjuntas, said during a Friday news conference in San Juan. “We took matters in our own hands since day one, because communication with the central government is really hard,” Barlucea said. “We’ve had landslides. We’re trying to reach those who have not been reached.”But instead of focusing on providing aid to the U.S. territory, Trump is trying to peddle Puerto Rico’s devastation and dire need for help as a direct attack from all of the groups that he’s deemed the opposition, from “fake news” to the Democrats and, now, the “poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan.”This isn’t the first time that Trump has used a national crisis to attack the news media.When the Charlottesville white supremacy rally escalated into deadly violence, Trump spent an unusual amount of time condemning the media for reporting on his response to it. He’s blamed “fake news” for the federal investigation looking into his campaign’s ties to Russia. He’s even dragged “fake news” into the GOP’s failed attempts to replace Obamacare.This time, however, he’s exploiting a devastated island filled with Americans who are looking for help. And the mayor of San Juan won’t stand for it.“The goal is one: Saving lives,” Cruz tweeted Saturday after Trump attacked both her and the reporters covering Puerto Rico’s devastation.“This is the time to show our ‘true colors.’ We cannot be distracted by anything else.”Here's how you can help Puerto Rico's recovery efforts.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-uses-puerto-rico-to-attack-news-media_n_59d003b5e4b06791bb10ea24,HuffPost,Liberal
166,Closed Puerto Rico factories are the sole source of some critical drugs,"Chris Isidore, Tal Kopan & Julia Horowitz",9/29/17,"The Food and Drug Administration is worried that there could be shortages of some critical drugs normally produced in Puerto Rico if manufacturing plants there are closed for an extended period of time.  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the FDA since May, arrived on Puerto Rico Friday to survey the situation and talk with pharmaceutical executives on the island. He said his agency has a list of about 40 drugs that it's concerned could be in short supply, 13 of which are made only in Puerto Rico.    
 
  ""These are critical medicines. These are not drugs for which there are therapeutic substitutes,"" he told reporters on the flight to Puerto Rico Friday.    The FDA is also working to make sure that island residents can get the drugs they need.    There are about 50 pharmaceutical plants on the island and about 30 that make medical devices. The industry has about 90,000 jobs there, and accounts for about 75% of the goods shipped off the island. Most major pharmaceutical companies have some kind of manufacturing presence on the island, including  Bristol-Myers Squibb   ( BMY ) ,  Eli Lilly   ( LLY )  and  Amgen   ( AMGN ) .   Gottleib said it's important that the plants that make drugs and medical devices resume normal operations soon, not just to help the patients who need them, but for Puerto Rico's economic health.   ""That manufacturing base is critical to long-term manufacturing success of the island, and also getting people back to work,"" Gottlieb said.    Bristol-Myers, Lilly and Amgen all told CNNMoney that they have adequate product inventory and there are not currently any shortages for their customers. They all said their major concern is the welfare of their Puerto Rican employees.   The good news is that the major factories suffered little damage, and most operating to some degree on generator power. The FDA's concern is making sure that those plants continue to get the fuel they need for the generators, the supplies they need to produce the drugs, and that the products they make can get off the island.   ""We think we're getting ahead of it,"" he said about the potential for shortages. ""The situation has been improving a lot since last week.""   Another challenge to keeping the factories running: Many employees haven't been able to return to work since Hurricane Maria hit nine days ago.   ""People are still taking care of their families,"" Gottleib said.

167,FEMA: Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure,"AnneClaire Stapleton, Katherine Grise and Jason Hanna",9/29/17," The US Army Corps of Engineers will rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, a Federal Emergency Management Agency official said. More than a week after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, the island is dealing with a humanitarian crisis as millions remain without electricity, water or gas. ""We're not going to rebuild the power grid overnight, but the US Army Corps of Engineers has just been mission-assigned, in the last 24 hours, to do just that,"" FEMA Deputy Director Daniel Kaniewski told CNN. ""In addition to generators and fuel, we have assigned the US Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild"" the US commonwealth's infrastructure.  Most of the island is without power, with the exception of people and facilities using generators, the  US Energy Department says . Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Thursday that power restoration would be slow because with hits from Maria -- and Hurricane Irma earlier in the month -- "" this infrastructure has honestly collapsed. "" 3-star general to lead military's efforts  At least 16 people have died in Puerto Rico as a result of the storm, Rosselló said Thursday. The Pentagon has  appointed Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan to lead all military hurricane recovery efforts  in Puerto Rico, US defense officials said Thursday.  Buchanan is a three-star general and the commander of  US Army North  (5th Army).  Buchanan has served four tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.  US Sen. Marco Rubio on Thursday called for the Defense Department to  take over short-term relief and recovery efforts . Rubio acknowledged FEMA's role in providing federal assistance to local governments but said the Defense Department is the ""only entity capable of executing a recovery effort of this scale and complexity.""  Jones Act waived; some supplies reportedly sit at port President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized a  10-day waiver of the Jones Act , a federal law that limits shipping to US ports by foreign vessels. Puerto Rico's governor and other US officials had argued that a waiver would expedite the shipping of supplies to the island. But some supplies appear to be sitting,  undistributed, at Puerto Rico's main Port of San Juan  -- though CNN has received conflicting information about the number of idle containers. Jose Ayala, vice president of operations for the Crowley shipping company, told CNN Thursday that at least 10,000 containers were sitting in the San Juan port, filled with ""food, water, medical aid, everything."" But Omar Marrero, executive director of Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority, said 7,500 containers were sitting at the port Thursday. And Hernan Ayala, president of the Puerto Rico Shipping Association, said none of the idle containers involved aid sent by FEMA. All FEMA cargo has been dispatched from the port to the rest of the island, Hernan Ayala said. He said the containers still there held items the port usually brings in --  ""food, provisions, refrigerated cargo, all kinds of general merchandise foods, furniture, liquor, manufacturing products, all kinds of cargo that we normally get.""  Part of the reason for distribution backlogs at the port is that only 20% of truck drivers have reported back to work since Hurricane Maria's landfall, according to a representative for Rosselló. A diesel fuel shortage and blocked roads also are complicating distribution efforts. Even contacting drivers is a problem because cell towers are down.  Rosselló said Thursday he signed an executive order to allow more flexibility for supply distribution. Starting Thursday,  truck drivers carrying essentials became  exempt from a government-mandated evening curfew  instituted to prevent looting, he said, and certain gas stations have been designated just for trucks at night.  Search and rescue FEMA said its search-and-rescue teams  had saved or assisted 843 people  in Puerto Rico as of Thursday morning. The US Coast Guard saved or assisted 15 people, according to FEMA. Shelters As of Thursday morning, 10,114 people were in 160 shelters in Puerto Rico, FEMA said. Gasoline stations and hospitals Of 1,100 gas stations in Puerto Rico, 689 were operating as of Thursday morning, Rosselló said. The distribution of diesel to hospitals, which will use them to operate power generators, increased over the last day, the governor said. Forty-four of the 47 hospitals that the federal government has assessed in Puerto Rico are operational,  FEMA said . Twenty-two other hospitals have yet to be assessed. On Monday, the island will receive 125,000 barrels of gas. ""Given those numbers, we can say that there is gasoline in Puerto Rico,"" the governor said. FEMA: Nearly 1 million meals distributed Nearly 1 million meals and about 2 million liters of water have been given out at 11 distribution centers in Puerto Rico as of Thursday morning, said John Rabin, acting regional administrator for the FEMA. FEMA expects another 3 million meals and 2 million liters of water will be handed out over the next few days, Rabin said. More police to Vieques Extra police and military troops will be sent Thursday to the island of  Vieques , 7 miles off Puerto Rico, Rosselló said. Asked if this was in response to reported looting on Vieques, Rosselló said he had not heard those reports. Bank closures Many Puerto Ricans are having trouble withdrawing from banks because of closures, and because many ATMs are not working or are not being reloaded. At least half of all bank branches on the island were closed Wednesday, said Zoime Alvarez, vice president at the Association of Banks of Puerto Rico. Banco Popular, a major Puerto Rican bank, told CNNMoney on Wednesday that only 57 of its 169 branches were open for business. And only 150 of its 600 ATMs were operating. Why? There weren't enough drivers to move the cash, bank branches were running on generators and can't get security software back online and some bank employees did not have enough gas to drive to work. $40 million available for road and bridge repairs The Federal Highway Administration on Thursday announced the immediate availability of $40 million to help restore essential service on roads and bridges damaged by Hurricane Maria. This money supplements the $2.5 million in emergency relief funds awarded to Puerto Rico for damages related to Hurricane Irma. Florida offers students in-state tuition Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who met with Rosselló in San Juan on Thursday, said Florida will offer in-state tuition to Puerto Rican students displaced by the two recent hurricanes. Airports San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport and eight other airports in Puerto Rico were open, or open with restrictions, the Defense Department said Thursday. Seaports The Port of San Juan and seven other ports were open Thursday, some with restrictions, the department said. CORRECTION:  A previous version of this story incorrectly attributed a statement that shipping containers still at the San Juan port held items that the port usually imports. The statement should have been attributed to Hernan Ayala, president of the Puerto Rico Shipping Association.

169,Trump White House feels heat on Puerto Rico,Stephen Collinson,9/29/17," Puerto Rico and Washington seem farther than 1,500 miles apart right now -- in fact they're experiencing a different version of reality. Nine days after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island,  emerging video and news reports of a heartrending humanitarian crisis are jarring  with the Trump administration's upbeat assessment of the relief effort. And as the islanders' plight is revealed, the White House risks becoming increasingly exposed politically at a time when it is already being pummeled by a tide of scandal and defeats, including the  controversy over Cabinet members using private jets  and the latest failed bid to repeal Obamacare. The dire situation, and the reluctance of President Donald Trump to publicly embrace complications in the relief effort, are also raising questions about why the response to Maria seems more sluggish than the government efforts following monster storms that hit Florida and Texas over the last month. The President himself, who did not appear in public Thursday, took to Twitter to rebut rising criticism of his government's response, saying ""massive"" amounts of food and water had been delivered while noting his planned visit next week. And he resorted to a familiar tactic when under fire -- slamming the media. ""Wish press would treat fairly!"" he wrote. Trump returned to Twitter on Friday morning to defend his administration's response after Puerto Rico's governor appeared on CNN: ""Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: ""The Administration and the President, every time we've spoken, they've delivered......"" Following up with a second tweet Trump went on: ""... The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!"" Part of the problem is the way the administration is talking about Puerto Rico. On Tuesday, Trump repeatedly boasted during a news conference that his team was doing a ""great job"" and said how ""nicely"" he had been treated by the island's governor, who he said had praised the administration's work. Three days later, even as harrowing scenes emerged from the territory, Trump's acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke  described the federal response to the disaster as ""a good news story."" The comments did not yet appear to match the notoriety of former President George W. Bush's comment to his FEMA director Michael Brown that he was doing a ""heck of a job"" during Hurricane Katrina. But the unfortunate assessments could come back to haunt the administration if the situation in Puerto Rico deteriorates further. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz rejected Duke's assessment. ""Maybe from where she's standing it's a good news story,"" she said on ""New Day."" ""When you are drinking from a creek it's not a good news story. When you don't have food for a baby, it's not a good news story."" Conditions And they are already conflicting with the emerging reality of life on the US territory, where nearly half the population remains without drinking water, hospitals struggle to stay open, food is scarce and 97% of people have no power. CNN reporters on Thursday related poignant stories of life after Maria, including that of one woman suffering from diabetes and an infection who was rushed to hospital by one of the network's crews. Such coverage is prompting some Trump critics to suggest more must be done. ""Where is the cavalry?"" asked Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson on Twitter. No one is saying that responding to a disaster of such magnitude is easy. Federal Emergency Management officials are exhausted after dealing with their third massive Hurricane in a few weeks after Harvey hit Texas and Irma barreled across Florida. Puerto Rico is less developed and wealthy than those states, and the logistical challenges of helping an offshore island with mountainous terrain are immense. The territory also lacks the network of NGOs and private sector groups that helped out when storms hit the US mainland.  The White House said Thursday that 10,000 federal relief workers and more than 7,000 troops were on the island in an operation that in many ways has more in common with US efforts to mitigate natural disasters in Haiti than storms on the US mainland. Yet there are mounting questions about whether the administration did enough to prepare for the storm, and whether actions it has taken since have been sufficient. And the repeated explanation by top officials of how hard things are is starting to wear thin. ""The island setting presents logistical hurdles that do not exist on the mainland, where trucks from around the country can converge on disaster areas,"" said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Thursday, using a formulation repeatedly voiced by officials in recent days. As criticism of the White House effort grows, several emerging political threats are evident. The increasing contrast between the situation on the island being portrayed in news reports and the White House is beginning to set up a credibility gap that is casting doubt on the administration's statements on the crisis. There's also a sense that officials are struggling to catch up with the quickly worsening narrative on the ground, and in the absence of a high-profile supremo to run the operation, or at least to speak about it publicly, the political messaging about the storm has been inconsistent. Whereas Duke referred to a ""good news"" story on Thursday, FEMA Administrator Brock Long declared that he was ""not satisfied"" with the situation in an interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan.  The government's response left retired Gen. Russel Honoré, who turned around the botched response to Katrina in 2005, fuming. ""I don't know what the hell is going on!"" he said on CNN, calling for the military to surge air traffic controllers onto the island to open airports, transportation specialists to clear roads and the deployment of many more troops, ships and helicopters. ""Puerto Rico is bigger than Katrina,"" he said. Business as usual If the government effort continues to appear outpaced by the scale of the disaster, there will inevitably be scrutiny of the man on whose desk the buck stops -- Trump. The President has yet to formally address Puerto Rico in a standalone speech. He has however mentioned the disaster during several encounters with the press and during other engagements. On Monday, he denied that his feud with the NFL, that he stokes every day, had distracted him from the worsening situation on the island. But the President has still gone about his normal business, including a trip to Indiana on Wednesday to promote his top political priority, tax reform. His only remarks on the situation on Thursday were on Twitter, and did not exactly drip with empathy for the victims. ""The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site,"" he wrote in one post. Still, the administration acted like it knows it had a perception problem on Thursday. The  President issued a waiver of the Jones Act , which requires cargo shipped between US ports to be carried on American flagged vessels, to facilitate the delivery of aid. The Pentagon meanwhile named three-star Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan to lead the military operation in Puerto Rico. And the White House deployed the President's top homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, who won good reviews of his performance during Irma and Harvey, to brief White House reporters. Even so, some of his answers seemed defensive. Asked by CNN's Jeff Zeleny why it had taken eight days to name Buchanan, Bossert answered: ""It didn't require a three-star general eight days ago."" He also defended the timing of the Jones Act waiver, saying ""that was not too late. It was not even too early."" Bossert also later defended Duke in an appearance on CNN, saying her remarks had been meant to highlight the selfless work of federal workers during the disaster. In another CNN interview on Friday Bossert mounted a strong defense of the administration's effort but conceded there were logistical problems to be surmounted. ""I don't accept that we're doing anything short of everything we can do,"" Bossert said on ""New Day"".",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/29/politics/president-donald-trump-puerto-rico-hurricane-politics/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjmjL7J28j6AhXobDABHYsGA-04WhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2W7HVKvmzCVaDgRBqDf5Al,CNN,Liberal
97,San Juan Mayor Fumes After Top Trump Official Calls Puerto Rico Response A 'Good News Story',Hayley Miller,9/29/17,"San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz is shutting down White House claims that the federal government is doing all it can to support Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria completely devastated the U.S. territory over a week ago.Cruz slammed Elaine Duke, acting secretary of Homeland Security, over her Thursday comments, which lauded the “amazing” federal response to the disaster.“I know it’s a hard storm to recover from,” Duke told reporters outside the White House. “But I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane.”But the situation continues to be dire as people in need await aid deliveries, said Cruz, who was shocked and appalled by Duke’s statement.“Maybe from where she’s standing it’s a good news story,” Cruz said on CNN’s “New Day” Friday. “When you are drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story.”“I’m sorry, but that really upsets me and frustrates me,” she continued, holding back tears. “Frankly, it’s an irresponsible statement. ... Damn it, this is not a good news story. This is a people are dying story. This is a life or death story. ... This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water.”“If I could scream it a lot more louder ― it’s not a good news story when people are dying when they don’t have dialysis, and when the generators aren’t working and the oxygen is not providing for them. Where is there good news here?”It’s been more than a week since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico as a powerful Category 5 hurricane ― the strongest storm to hit the island in over 80 years. There have been at least 16 Maria-related deaths on Puerto Rico, though experts said they expect the death toll to rise as recovery efforts continue.President Donald Trump has come under fire over his response to the disaster. He tweeted over a dozen times last weekend about the NFL, yet didn’t mention Puerto Rico once on the social media platform during that time. The president pushed back against claims from lawmakers who suggested he ought to spend more time focused on disaster relief and less on the football players protesting during the national anthem.“I have plenty of time on my hands,” Trump said Tuesday during a news conference when asked if he was too distracted by the NFL to focus on Puerto Rico. “All I do is work.”The seemingly contradictory statements were followed up Friday with tweets, in which the president quoted Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello’s statement about the federal government’s relief efforts.Cruz isn’t buying it though. She made another desperate appeal to Trump on Friday, asking him to step up the response efforts and figure out a way to deliver much-needed aid to struggling Puerto Ricans, despite logistical issues.“Thank you for calling San Juan yesterday and listening for our May Day call,” said Cruz, speaking directly to Trump through CNN. “There are 77 other towns that are waiting anxiously and will be very grateful to you and to the American people if you continue to step up to the moral imperative that you have taken on all over the world to help those in need.”“So help us,” she continued. “I know he can do it because he did it yesterday with San Juan. Somebody heard me. They just came to San Juan and things started moving and rolling. But this has to happen on a continuous basis for the entire island of Puerto Rico.”“Let’s get it done. ... Let’s put a crew of people out there with enough equipment and let’s just push things out of the way and move. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Isn’t that the American way of doing things?

96,San Juan Mayor Slams Feds' Response To Puerto Rico: 'Get Your Ass Moving',Carla Herreria Russo,9/29/17,"The mayor of San Juan on Friday tore into the federal government’s response to recovery efforts inPuerto Rico and begged the rest of the country to send help to the island.“We are dying here, and I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles,” Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said at a news conference at a distribution center. “Mayday! We are in trouble.”Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 20. So far at least 16 deathshave been reported, a number that will likely grow as recovery efforts continue. Only 11 of the island’s 69 hospitals currently have power or fuel, and an estimated 44 percent of the population iswithout drinking water.“I am going to do what I never thought I would do. I am begging, begging anyone who can hear us to save us from dying,” Cruz said, holding back tears.“We are dying, and you are killing us with inefficiency and bureaucracy.”Cruz specifically criticized theFederal Emergency Management Agency’s constant requests for her office to provide reports, assessments and memos, which she says has slowed down the process of actually providing help.She held up thick binders to show the amount of paperwork that FEMA has requested of her and suggested that the government did not appear to be acting with any sense of urgency.“You think that’s enough paperwork for FEMA to get their ass moving?”Cruz appeared exasperated with the government’s delayed response to Puerto Rico, where millions of people still await help and deliveries of basic human necessities.Cruz, who oversees the largest city on the island, described residents who were forced to drink out of creeks and dehydrated senior citizens who were trapped in buildings that were like “human cages.”Cruz rebuked a remark made earlier Friday by a government official who said that getting aid was much more complicated than expected. “You know what? This is the United States of America,” the mayor said. “If somebody can put a man on the moon, they surely can walk around on an island ... and figure out the appropriate technology to get it.”Cruz also appealed to President Donald Trump, who has praised the government’s response in Puerto Rico, to do more than fly over the U.S. territory when he visits next week.“I hope as the president comes next week he doesn’t just get an aerial view of the situation,” she said. “Let him hear the cries of elderly people outside windows and doors screaming, ‘Help us.’”Aid workers have warned that recovery efforts in Puerto Rico could take years due to extensive damage to the island’s agriculture and the downing of 2,400 miles of power transmission lines. One local official said that the devastation may have set the island back “nearly 20 to 30 years.”Cruz used the news conference to ask U.S. citizens to send help and requested that news reporters send a “mayday” emergency call to the world. “I know your hearts. You’re loving and caring. Help us. Show the world what we can do together,” she said.“Call your local representative. Call everyone you can. Let’s show the world the generosity, the audacity and the hope that the U.S. can provide. You are a country of the people. Just let the people shine. Let them shine.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/san-juan-mayor-fema-hurricane-response_n_59cea7dbe4b09538b50842c2,HuffPost,Liberal
98,San Juan Mayor Fumes After Top Trump Official Calls Puerto Rico Response A 'Good News Story',Hayley Miller,9/29/17,"San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz is shutting down White House claims that the federal government is doing all it can to support Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria completely devastated the U.S. territory over a week ago.Cruz slammed Elaine Duke, acting secretary of Homeland Security, over her Thursday comments, which lauded the“amazing” federal response to the disaster.“I know it’s a hard storm to recover from,” Duke told reporters outside the White House. “But I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane.”But the situation continues to be dire as people in need await aid deliveries, said Cruz, who was shocked and appalled by Duke’s statement.“Maybe from where she’s standing it’s a good news story,” Cruz said on CNN’s “New Day” Friday. “When you are drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story.”“I’m sorry, but that really upsets me and frustrates me,” she continued, holding back tears. “Frankly, it’s an irresponsible statement. ... Damn it, this is not a good news story. This is a people are dying story. This is a life or death story. ... This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water.”“If I could scream it a lot more louder ― it’s not a good news story when people are dying when they don’t have dialysis, and when the generators aren’t working and the oxygen is not providing for them. Where is there good news here?”It’s been more than a week since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico as a powerful Category 5 hurricane ― the strongest storm to hit the island in over 80 years. There have been at least 16 Maria-related deaths on Puerto Rico, though experts said they expect the death toll to rise as recovery efforts continue.President Donald Trump has come under fire over his response to the disaster. He tweeted over a dozen times last weekend about the NFL, yet didn’t mention Puerto Rico once on the social media platform during that time. The president pushed back against claims from lawmakers who suggested he ought to spend more time focused on disaster relief and less on the football players protesting during the national anthem.“I have plenty of time on my hands,” Trump said Tuesday during a news conference when asked if he was too distracted by the NFL to focus on Puerto Rico. “All I do is work.”The seemingly contradictory statements were followed up Friday with tweets, in which the president quoted Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello’s statement about the federal government’s relief efforts.Cruz isn’t buying it though. She made another desperate appeal to Trump on Friday, asking him to step up the response efforts and figure out a way to deliver much-needed aid to struggling Puerto Ricans, despite logistical issues.“Thank you for calling San Juan yesterday and listening for our May Day call,” said Cruz, speaking directly to Trump through CNN. “There are 77 other towns that are waiting anxiously and will be very grateful to you and to the American people if you continue to step up to the moral imperative that you have taken on all over the world to help those in need.”“So help us,” she continued. “I know he can do it because he did it yesterday with San Juan. Somebody heard me. They just came to San Juan and things started moving and rolling. But this has to happen on a continuous basis for the entire island of Puerto Rico.”“Let’s get it done. ... Let’s put a crew of people out there with enough equipment and let’s just push things out of the way and move. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Isn’t that the American way of doing things? You never get distracted by the obstacles and move ahead and push on and show the world what you can do. Let’s show them. Let’s just show them one more time what the U.S. can do.”",[],HuffPost,Liberal
168,Puerto Rico under a flash flood watch as the wait for supplies drags on,Jason Hanna and Nicole Chavez,9/29/17," Ten days after Hurricane Maria began to crash into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, the island is dealing with a humanitarian crisis as millions remain without electricity and water, and limited access to gas and cash.  The majority of the US commonwealth is without power, with the exception of people and facilities using generators,  the US Energy Department says . Heavy rain is expected this weekend -- and that could make recovery efforts on the island of 3.4 million people even harder. Puerto Rico is under a  flash flood watch  until late Sunday because of the predicted rain, which could be between 2 and 4 inches each day, the National Weather Service said.  ""Soils are already saturated and most of the rivers and small streams are running above or well above normal levels,"" meteorologists said. Still, military troops and disaster relief workers are improving supply chains, and ""you'll see more presence, more equipment, in support of the municipalities"" over the next few days, Federal Emergency Management Agency official Alejandro de la Campa told reporters Friday. At least 16 people have died on the island as a result of the storm, the government has said. Aid delivery • About 3,000 crates of private-sector goods -- such as food meant for grocery stores -- have been sitting idle at the Port of San Juan, in part because not all drivers have reported back to work since Maria but also because of other logistical challenges, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Friday. • The government will call the private owners and ask whether they can pick up the goods. If they cannot, the government will require the owners to sell the goods to the Puerto Rican government so that it can deliver them to the people, Rosselló said Friday. • None of the idle containers carried aid sent by FEMA; that aid was continually distributed, FEMA officials have said. 8 numbers that show how Maria has laid waste to Puerto Rico • Rosselló's count of the idle crates was  lower than that of two shipping industry officials . • Officials are sending aid to 11 distribution points, where mayors can arrange to pick up supplies and distribute them to their communities, FEMA's de la Campa said Friday. FEMA has sent aid directly to some communities that haven't been able to access distribution points, he said. • Emergency workers have been to all 78 of Puerto Rico's municipalities and started coordinating with local leaders, de la Campa said. • President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized  a 10-day waiver of the Jones Act , a federal law that limits shipping to US ports by foreign vessels. Rosselló and other US officials had argued that a waiver would expedite the shipping of supplies to the island.  •  Nearly 1 million meals and about 2 million liters of water have been handed out as of Friday, according to FEMA. Curfew hours reduced • The government-mandated evening curfew instituted to prevent looting will now start at 9 p.m. instead of 7 p.m., Rosselló said Friday. That gives citizens -- many of whom are spending hours in line at banks, fuel stations and groceries -- two extra hours to get tasks done. The curfews still end at 5 a.m. • Truck drivers carrying essentials were declared exempt from the curfew Thursday.  Water • Water service has been restored to about 45% to 50% of the island's customers, de la Campa said Friday. That's up from about 33% from Thursday, he said. Hospitals • Hospitals in Puerto Rico  have been struggling to treat patients . Some don't have enough medication, while others have a shortage of fuel for generators. •  Officials have given conflicting information about the number of hospitals that are open. FEMA said Friday that 56 of the island's 69 hospitals are partially operational and one is fully functioning. Earlier, Rosselló said 36 hospitals were open, with power delivered regularly or through diesel-powered generators. • The US Army has been  delivering fuel to hospitals  as part of a rotation plan developed by FEMA to ensure the facilities have continuous power, officials said. • Still  many roads are impassable , preventing people from reaching medical facilities.  Gas stations • Many Puerto Ricans are waiting in line for hours to get gas. There were about 100 cars backed up early Friday at one San Juan station. A man at the front of the line told CNN's Boris Sanchez he'd been there since 9 p.m. Thursday, and had slept in his car, waiting for the station to open. • About 675 of the island's roughly 1,110 gas stations were working as of Friday evening, according to the Puerto Rican government's  website for information on the recovery . Bank closures • Puerto Ricans are running low on money, and many businesses, such as supermarkets and gas stations, will accept only cash because credit card systems are down. • At least half of all bank branches remain shuttered, in part because they can't get enough armored trucks with gas, or truck drivers, to deliver the cash safely.  • The roughly 90 open bank branches are limiting the amounts people can withdraw per day, the governor said Friday, to ensure everyone can get some cash, even if it might not be all they want. •   Banks are also struggling to get software and safety systems back online , according to Zoime Alvarez, vice president of the Association of Banks of Puerto Rico. San Juan mayor: 'Damn it, this is not a good news story'  •  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz  reacted with anger Friday to a statement from acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, who had said earlier that the government's response in Puerto Rico ""is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people.""  •   ""Damn it, this is not a good news story. This is a 'people are dying' story. It's a life-or-death story,""  Yulín Cruz told CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday morning . •   Duke traveled to Puerto Rico on Friday. In San Juan, she told reporters that she is ""happy"" about how hard everyone is working but said that ""there's much, much more work to do and we will never be satisfied"" until people are safe and schools are open. • Asked for her reaction to the mayor's rebuke, Duke said she was referring to how well everyone is working together: ""The end of my statement about good news was, it was good news that the people of Puerto Rico, the many public servants of the US and the government of Puerto Rico are working together, and ... it's nice to see communities together trying to recover and support each other."" • Yulín   Cruz, on ""AC360,"" said there is a disconnect between the plan and what is happening. The mayor -- who was wearing a shirt that said ""Help Us We Are Dying"" -- said one of the problems is that FEMA wants people to use the Internet to register. She gave her FEMA supplies to another town, she told Cooper. Other federal response • The Pentagon has appointed  Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan  to lead all military hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Buchanan is commander of US Army North (5th Army). • At least 10,000 federal relief workers are on the island, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday.  • There are 4,400 active-duty US troops and about 2,800 National Guard forces in Puerto Rico. Airports  • San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport and eight other airfields are open or open with restrictions, FEMA said. A long night at Puerto Rican airport • The San Juan airport started allowing more than a dozen commercial passenger planes to fly in and out after air traffic control services were restored.   Seaports The Port of San Juan and seven other ports were open Thursday, some with restrictions, the department said. Rebuilding and moving forward • The US Army Corps of Engineers have been assigned to help Puerto Rico rebuild its infrastructure, a FEMA deputy director said. • The US Federal Highway Administration has announced the immediate availability of $40 million to help restore roads and bridges across the island and damage related to mudslides and flooding. • The  University of Central Florida  and  Miami Dade College  are offering in-state tuition rates to displaced college students from Puerto Rico, officials said.

101,EPA Fills Puerto Rico Post Left Vacant For 9 Months Amid Hurricane Disaster,Alexander C. Kaufman,9/28/17,"The Environmental Protection Agency named a new administrator for the region encompassing New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on Thursday, filling a post left vacant for nearly nine months. Peter Lopez has little time to waste.The Republican state assemblyman from upstate New York faces a staggering environmental and humanitarian disaster in the Caribbean part of EPA Region 2. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands suffered widespread destruction after Hurricane Irma and, two weeks later, Hurricane Maria marauded the territories, tearing down power lines and flooding homes and crops. The islands could be without electricity for up to six months ― and maybe more.Lopez takes office Oct. 10. He’ll likely spend his first day getting briefed on the scope of the environmental catastrophe, according to Judith Enck, the regional administration from 2009 to January 2017. On his second day, he should fly down there, she said.“One of Peter’s first challenges will be getting down to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and seeing it firsthand,” Enck told HuffPost by phone Thursday afternoon. “It is an unfolding environmental and humanitarian crisis that the federal government has been doing a bad job handling so far.”Lopez, 56, who was still working at the New York State Assembly on Thursday afternoon, could not immediately be reached for an interview.In catastrophes like the one facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the EPA generally takes a backseat to the Federal Emergency Management Agency but still plays a key role in directing relief efforts and identifying and cleaning up pollution unleashed by the storms.Lopez arrives at an agency facing growing demands and shrinking resources. President Donald Trump made dismantling huge portions of the EPA a priority and proposed shrinking its budget by 31 percent, a plan endorsed by controversial EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.“Pete Lopez has spent nearly a decade in one of the country’s largest state legislatures working to improve the quality of life of his constituents,” Pruitt said in a statement. “His familiarity with the region and his experience working to solve environmental problems in New York will be invaluable in helping EPA serve Americans in the Northeast and the Caribbean.”Enck said Region 2 ― with a $700 million budget and 800-person staff, including 50 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and two in the U.S. Virgin Islands ― risks losing capacity to respond to disasters. She said it’s not unusual to name a regional administrator months after a new administration takes office, but she declined to comment on the timing of the EPA’s announcement. Still, she described Lopez’s appointment as “a pleasant surprise.”  About 32 years ago, Lopez, whose father is from Puerto Rico, interned for her at the nonprofit Environmental Advocates in Albany, New York’s capital.Plus, he has experience managing disaster relief in his upstate New York district after back-to-back storms tore roofs off barns and flooded businesses throughout Schoharie County. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene, then the worst storm in decades, made landfall in the state, causing $1.3 billion in damage and leaving 1.1 million without power. Weeks later, Tropical Storm Lee hit, inducing another round of devastating flooding.The state Assembly affords little power to the minority party, so, Enck said, leaving in the middle of his term could offer Lopez a chance to wield real power. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) must now either call for a special election or wait until 2018 to replace Lopez, as the deadline to run in the state’s Nov. 7 election has passed. “He’s terrific,” Enck said. “He’s smart, he cares about the environment and he’s super nice, which counts when you’re working with a demoralized workforce.”  The EPA drew criticism last month after The Associated Press reported that agency officials were nowhere to found as toxic waste sites in Houston flooded during Hurricane Harvey. The agency, which has become increasingly politicized under Pruitt, took the unusual step of publicly attacking the reporter who uncovered the story. Pruitt, who sued the EPA to block environmental rules at least a dozen times in his previous job as Oklahoma’s attorney general, has taken drastic steps to redefine the agency’s mission since taking office in February. He’s embraced executives from heavily polluting industries and scrapped regulations, including ones to reduce planet-warming emissions and limit exposure to toxic chemicals. He helped orchestrate the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and has repeatedly repudiated the widely accepted science linking global warming to human activities. “He should buy boxes of Wheaties by the cart,” Enck said, “because he’s going to have to be very strong, standing up to Pruitt.” ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
170,The Jones Act has been hurting Puerto Rico for decades,Chris Isidore,9/28/17,"The Jones Act has always been a big problem for Puerto Rico -- long before Hurricane Maria savaged the island.  The law dates back to 1920 and requires all goods ferried between U.S. ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans. And those ships are far more expensive to buy and operate than ships flying foreign flags. As a result, it makes just about everything in Puerto Rico more expensive.    
 
  A 2012 study from the New York Federal Reserve found that shipping a container from the US East Coast to Puerto Rico cost $3,063. But shipping the same container on a foreign ship to the Dominican Republic nearby cost only $1,504. More broadly, the island loses $537 million per year as a result of the Jones Act, according to a different study conducted in 2010 at the University of Puerto Rico.    A 2010 study at the University of Puerto Rico concluded that the island lost $537 million per year as a result of the Jones Act.    Puerto Rican businesses and consumers feel the effects of the Jones Act every day. And the same goes for Hawaii, and to some extent in Alaska. But it gets little attention on the U.S. mainland, since it's often faster and cheaper move goods in the continental U.S. by rail, truck or pipeline.   ""The [Puerto Rican] economy is fragile. Even if [the Jones Act] is adding an extra 10 or 20 cents on everything you use, you're talking about thousands of dollars a year for an economy that can't afford it,"" said Shane Skelton, policy advisor for the Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure, a think tank that promotes economic efficiency.   ""Unfortunately it really only comes to light when we have a catastrophe,"" he said. ""We should look at the impact of this year round.""   Government officials in Puerto Rico requested Wednesday that the law  be waived temporarily  to make it easier to ship emergency supplies to the island, and the Trump administration  granted a 10-day waiver  on Thursday. It's not clear how much the waiver will help during the current crisis, since the ports are already  jammed with supplies  that can't be distributed to people in need due to logistical problems on the island.    Many critics of the Jones Act, including Republican Senator John McCain, have argued for years that it should be permanently repealed since the higher shipping costs are a drag on Puerto Rico's already struggling economy.   But U.S. shipping lines that benefit from the law have fought successfully to keep it in place. It protects thousands of American maritime jobs, and it's unlikely to be changed in the current protectionist political environment, Skelton said. Still he and other experts say it may cost more jobs than it protects, since businesses on the island buy imported goods which can be shipped at a lower cost on boats flying foreign flags.    ""The rate difference between Jones Act carriers and foreign carriers has led farmers and ranchers on the island to more often source animal feed and crop fertilizers from foreign sources than from U.S. domestic sources, even though commodity prices were stated to be similar,"" said a 2013 report by the GAO. Most fuel on the island is also bought from foreign countries for the same reason.   But the GAO said it is difficult to determine the true additional cost of shipping because of the Jones Act. The trade group for the U.S. carriers argues scrapping the law would hurt the Puerto Rican economy, not help it.   ""American domestic carriers are making some of the largest private sector investments currently underway in Puerto Rico by investing nearly $1 billion in new vessels, equipment, and infrastructure,"" said the American Maritime Partnership. ""They employ hundreds of Puerto Rican American citizens on the island and on vessels serving the market, providing highly reliable, low-cost maritime and logistics services. These private sector jobs and reliable services are important to the long-term recovery of the Puerto Rican economy and would be jeopardized by changes to the Jones Act.""

171,Delivering aid to Puerto Rico a challenge for volunteers,Nicole Chavez,9/28/17," People across the US mainland are stepping up to help Puerto Ricans, but getting the aid there is proving difficult. Volunteers are facing expensive shipping costs and long delivery times due to limited access to the island. More than  a week after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico , millions of people in the US territory are still in the dark and food is becoming scarce.  Non-perishable items and other donations sit  at Puerto Rico's main port of San Juan  and have yet to be delivered -- or are held up at ports in the US mainland. And only a handful of flights are traveling to the island. Students at a New York high school are filling up their school's auditorium with water, boxes of cereal and canned foods but can't find a way to send them to the island. Sending donations to Puerto Rico could cost the Comsewogue High School in Long Island between $17,000 and $25,000, school officials told  CNN affiliate WABC reported .   How to help the victims of Hurricane Maria ""I have probably called over 25 to 30 companies. All through Long Island, a couple of companies down in Florida,"" Vince Roman, a physical education teacher, told WABC.  In New Orleans, a group of pilots and aviation enthusiasts, who collected about 25,000 pounds of supplies and flew them to Texas after Hurricane Harvey, are shifting their focus to Puerto Rico. ""Puerto Rico, USVI, and other areas affected have no idea how many people are behind them and ready to assist! We're anxious to get down there!,"" the Cajun Airlift group posted on Facebook. Volunteers at Casa Puertorriqueña, a group that organizes the annual Puerto Rican Parade in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood, have filled up   at least eight trucks with everything from flashlights and batteries  to canned goods and baby diapers, CNN affiliate WGN-TV reported.  But the donated goods remain in a warehouse.  ""We can't get these companies to fly this stuff to Puerto Rico,"" said Vilma Colom, community outreach and engagement volunteer at Casa Puertorriqueña told WGN-TV.  ""We're not getting the help that we need like everybody else has gotten during these crises."" Members of the Puerto Rican community in Los Angeles are also mobilizing to send help.  They turned a Cuban supper club in Hollywood into a donation center and slowly have been sending supplies.  ""We have our hands tied in a lot of ways but we are not stopping,"" said Ana Miró, a member of Los Angeles for Puerto Rico.  The group already sent some donations on Delta and JetBlue relief flights and plan to send more aid in the coming weeks.  ""We plan to gather things and keep sending them,"" Miró said. ""We are not stopping for any reason.""",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/us/puerto-rico-mainland-donations/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiq4ee-68j6AhVdSDABHcVLClg4-gEQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw19J4TWa95AOE9oGYmiBU0t,CNN,Liberal
172,Trump authorizes waiver to loosen shipping regulations for Puerto Rico,Daniella Diaz,9/28/17," The White House has authorized a waiver to loosen shipping rules regarding Puerto Rico that island officials say would be a significant help for recovery efforts from Hurricane Maria. ""At @ricardorossello request, @POTUS has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted Thursday morning. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said the waiver will be in effect for 10 days and will cover all products being shipped to Puerto Rico, according to a release from the department.  The waiver will guarantee the needed equipment to repair infrastructure damaged by the storm and restore emergency services, Duke said in a news release.  After the 10-day period, the waiver can be extended if needed, DHS spokesman David Lapan told CNN. He said the waiver was approved after it was determined that doing so was in the interest of national defense. Earlier Thursday, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said he had asked the White House to loosen the regulations. He joined the growing list of officials who argued that lifting the the Jones Act -- a federal law designed to protect the financial interests of US shipbuilders by limiting shipping by foreign vessels -- would help expedite supplies to the ravaged island. The act has had the unintended consequence of making it twice as expensive to ship things from the US mainland to Puerto Rico as it is to ship from any other foreign port in the world, according to Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain's office. DHS denies that it rejected request to loosen shipping rules for Puerto Rico The act was quickly lifted to help Texas and Florida in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The Department of Homeland Security said it was able to lift the restrictions quickly because the Department of Defense requested a waiver for those states and the department hadn't yet done so for Puerto Rico. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that ""we're thinking"" about lifting the law, but added that a ""lot of shippers"" didn't want it lifted. What the Jones Act controversy is all about In the wake of the devastation in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricane Maria, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz -- along with other US politicians, including McCain and Marco Rubio, R-Florida -- had urged the suspension of the Jones Act in order to speed up supply deliveries. The Jones Act was waived earlier this month to provide relief assistance prior to Hurricane Irma's landfall, DHS said.

173,Patients trapped in shelters in Puerto Rico can't get to hospitals,Michael Nedelman,9/28/17," ""Nobody is taking care of us,"" said Josefina Alvarez, 62, who had been stuck in a shelter outside of San Juan for nearly two weeks. She is one of many Puerto Ricans who have been displaced -- and put in grave danger -- in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Alvarez is sick and bedridden. A diabetic with breathing issues, she's getting worse by the day. Now, she might have a life-threatening infection -- and no one can get her to a hospital. Not even Dr. Astrid Morales. ""She's getting more complicated, with fever and all that, and we have nothing here to give her,"" said Morales, a local doctor who has been visiting patients at a shelter in Loiza. ""Time is really limited."" When CNN arrived at the shelter, an ambulance was there but didn't have enough gasoline to get her to the nearest hospital. On another occasion, a medical team said they didn't have ""authorization from their bosses"" to get an ambulance to take her, according to Morales. ""We're in the middle of a disaster ... and you're waiting for paperwork?,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. ""The hospitals are closed ... not taking any patients,"" Morales lamented.  Doctors expected hospitals in Puerto Rico to overflow with patients who were desperately seeking care after the storm. But a week after the storm, many have no long lines at all; waiting rooms are unexpectedly sparse. Instead, many are in shelters. When some hospitals closed temporarily around the storm, people didn't know where else to get help. Many flocked to shelters where they thought they'd be safe. This included bedridden people and others who have been too sick or disabled to leave the shelters on their own. But shelters lack the power, medications and supplies to treat people like Alvarez.  And some who didn't evacuate are still stuck in their homes, according to Morales. ""They're trapped,"" she said. At any moment A nearby hospital was supposedly up and running -- the Concilio de Salud Integral de Loiza. But the hospital said it wasn't accepting any patients, Morales said. Meanwhile, Alvarez wasn't getting any better. Gupta said some facilities are afraid to accept patients because they don't have enough medications, fuel for generators or clean water; they could be forced to shut their doors at any moment. On Tuesday, Gupta spoke to a doctor at one clinic that only had  six hours of diesel left.  By Wednesday, they received fuel, but their water supply was now running low. There are 51 hospitals considered operational out of the island's 69, according to homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. For a hospital to be considered open, ""that generally focuses first on their ability to provide and sustain emergency power -- whether they have diesel fuel. And that's not necessarily an ideal condition,"" Bossert said. He added that hospitals must also have the staff and medicines required to see, treat and admit patients. The reported numbers of open facilities don't seem to match the reality on the ground, according to doctors on the island. Finally, an answer Doctors outside of San Juan are frustrated -- bewildered, even. Some basic supplies are already on the island, but a fuel shortage, blocked roads and other challenges have  hindered their distribution.   Supplies aren't getting to shelters, and patients aren't getting to the hospital. ""We need to find out where we can send patients,"" Morales said. ""The communications are awful."" Her priority was to get help for Alvarez. ""If we can get in touch with the health secretary, maybe he can tell us where we can send patients, which emergency rooms are open,"" she said. ""Or send us IV antibiotics, and we can deal with it here."" Morales was able to reach the health secretary on a CNN satellite phone. She spoke in Spanish about Alvarez: ""There's a patient who has had an abscess for a week and a half."" After a brief conversation, she had an answer: Alvarez could go to Centro Medico in San Juan, one of the largest hospitals in the Caribbean.  But she needed to get there. ""We've been to this Centro Medico. We know what the facilities are like,"" Gupta told her. ""We could take the patient ourselves. I know time is of the essence here."" One of many ""That hurts!"" Alvarez moaned as she was moved into a wheelchair, and then into a large black van that was hardly equipped to serve as an ambulance. But it was the only option. Alvarez lay on her right side, with an abscess on her left. Her husband held her hand from the back seat during the ride to San Juan.  When they finally reached the hospital, she was whisked away on a stretcher and into a tent. By the evening, doctors were planning to perform surgery on her abscess and treat the infection. She got the care she needs, but Alvarez is just one patient. ""There are probably thousands of patients who are in similar shelters -- no power, no water, no medications, no way out. There are probably thousands more who are still in their homes,"" Gupta said. There are over 10,000 people in shelters across Puerto Rico, according to FEMA. Like Alvarez, many are only getting sicker.  ""These people are going to need help for quite a while,"" said Dr. Jim Lapkoff, a chief medical officer with the National Disaster Medical System. Lapkoff is one of the doctors treating patients in the tents outside of the hospital where Alvarez is being treated. Those especially at risk are people like the elderly and those with chronic diseases. ""I anticipate that as people become more mobile ... we're going to start seeing more and more patients,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/health/gupta-puerto-rico-hospitals/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjck4ew4Mj6AhUKSDABHQKHB6g4jAEQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw3JRuxudqtG22cJBvjVWhpS,CNN,Liberal
100,Puerto Rico’s Colonial Legacy Doomed It To Dirty Electricity — And Now Darkness,Alexander C. Kaufman,9/28/17,"Puerto Rico plunged into darkness last week after the second major hurricane in a month crippled its aging, debt-laden electric utility. The island is projected to be without power for six months or more, as people swelter and lifesaving medical equipment saps generators in what House Speaker Paul Ryandeclared “a humanitarian crisis” on Tuesday.But it’s not just old, storm-vulnerable transmission lines that need to be replaced.Forty-seven percent of the power the troubled Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority generates is from burning oil ― one of the most polluting and least efficient sources of electricity. An additional 51 percent of Puerto Rico’s energy blend comes from a mix of coal and natural gas. Just 2 percent was drawn from renewable sources last year.The utility’s dependence on imported fossil fuels has devoured funding that could have been spent on upgrading the island’s grid and building cleaner infrastructure, a sign of years of mismanagement and incompetence. But it also stems from a colonial history in which Puerto Rico’s development was put in the hands of a few mainland corporate interests seeking tax breaks.Now the debt-strangled island finds itself in the grip of Wall Street creditors who hold much of the $74 billion in municipal debt racked up over the past few decades. And under theTrump administration, which denies climate change is a concern and has dismissed the need for clean energy, Puerto Rico’s hopes for a greener grid after power is restored seem dim.PREPAdeclared bankruptcy in July, but its problems began years earlier. Puerto Rico suffers four to five times more blackouts than an average U.S. state, despite paying the country’s second-highest electricity rates after Hawaii, at nearly 20 cents per kilowatt hour. The utility operates in whatSlate called a “permanent state of triage.”“The fact is that safety and reliability must be PREPA’s first priorities, above all other considerations,” a searing report commissioned by the Puerto Rican government concluded last year. “Energy efficiency and renewable energy take time to implement; PREPA’s system is in a desperate state today.” The report described the utility’s budget as “opaque and distortionary,” made worse by “poor record keeping.” The generous $134 million allocated for discretionary spending ― nearly one-third of the annual budget ― suggested a slush fund. Alleged corruption only made operating costs higher. A class-action lawsuit filed in 2015 accused PREPA of more than $1 billion in fraud, claiming it had taken kickbacks from oil suppliers including Brazil’s Petrobras and Royal Dutch Shell.Yet the administration at the utility “answered to no one” and remained “almost impervious to reform,” according to Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who oversaw the region that includes Puerto Rico from 2009 to 2017.“They just really embraced the status quo, which meant fossil fuels,” Enck told HuffPost. “It was a public utility that was stuck in the 1950s.”The hurricanes that rocked Puerto Rico ― part of a pattern of storms that experts say is intensifying with climate change ― lay bare the tragic paradox of the effects felt on a warming planet. The tiny island of just over 3.4 million is likely to suffer some of the worst symptoms of rising seas and temperatures, despite benefiting only marginally from the rapid industrialization scientists blame for pumping climate-changing gases into the atmosphere. Poor stewardship at the hands of local officials likely left PREPA ill-prepared for this new reality, but the utility’s failure to adapt highlights the flaws in a U.S. system designed to treat colonial possessions as secondary concerns. Puerto Rico’s status as a territory puts its people at a disadvantage compared with other U.S. citizens. Federal spending is usually provided in the form of block grants, limiting the amount of money the island can request. In 1980, the Supreme Court set the legal framework for maintaining Puerto Rico as a second-tier priority for the federal government when it ruled that treating territories differently from states did not violate the Constitution’s equal protection clause. “That opinion has become the basis for everything, including the justification for block grants,” Charles Venator-Santiago, a Puerto Rican politics expert and professor at the University of Connecticut, told HuffPost. “Infrastructure development on the island has only gone up to a point because it’s been blocked or money has run out. It’s capped.”Like most colonial possessions, Puerto Rico’s development has historically served its imperial master. Under the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, also known as the Jones Act, non-U.S. ships are barred from docking in Puerto Rico, meaning the island depends on shipments from the U.S. mainland rather than its Caribbean neighbors. (After pressure from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the Trump administration on Thursday approved a request to lift the rule to allow more aid into the storm-ravaged island).“It’s a colonial imposition saying, ‘No, you can only trade with the United States,’” Catalina de Onís, a professor of civic communication at Willamette University in Oregon, told HuffPost. “It’s a way of helping corporations make more money off Puerto Rico.”Even the federal government’s most open-handed spending spree benefited the mainland. Public spending spurred after the Great Depression by the New Deal sent wages surging in most states. But in Puerto Rico, 79 cents out of each dollar paid in wages by the agencies established by the New Deal went to importing food and clothing, and “were thus returned to the United States within the third commercial turnover,” according to the documents cited by Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum.In 1947, the federal government and then-Gov. Luis Muñoz Marín launched Operation Bootstrap, a plan to develop the island. The first phase attracted textile and garment factories, drawn by the rock-bottom wages they could get away with paying Puerto Ricans then. The second phase offered tax exemptions that drew capital-intensive businesses, such as drugmakers, petrochemical plants and oil refineries. Oil, not surprisingly, became the chief source of power for the island.Tax breaks formed the cornerstone of Puerto Rico’s development strategy, to some success. By 1967, the number of Puerto Ricans employed in manufacturing had more than doubled to 121,537, according to Department of Commerce estimates. But by the early 1990s, the exemptions became a target for tax reformers who railed against what they saw as corporate welfare and argued that allowing firms headquartered in the 50 states to shirk taxes in the territory put an unfair burden on Puerto Rican companies. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a law to phase out many of the exemptions over 10 years.Companies began to flee, and with them, jobs. That led to a higher unemployment rate ― now at 11.5 percent, more than double the U.S. average.Yet one key tax break stayed in place. As a territory, interest on Puerto Rico’s municipal bonds ― debt securities issued by the government to pay for day-to-day public expenses, such as utilities, roads and schools ― remained tax exempt. Puerto Rico’s credit score remained low enough to keep interest rates lucrative but high enough to make bonds seem like a safe bet. Facing declining income tax revenue as Puerto Ricans began to leave for the mainland in search of work, the island issued more and more debt. Mutual funds bought the IOUs as quickly as the so-called “belle of the bond market” issued them. In 2013, it came to a crashing halt as Puerto Rico was shut out of the bond markets and risk-hungry hedge funds began circling like vultures. Four years later, Puerto Rico owes $74 billion to bondholders and $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and other government employees. PREPA alone racked up $9 billion in debt. Now the efforts to restructure the utility’s debt are being as badly mismanaged as the public agency’s finances in the first place, according to a scathing report released in August 2016 by the nonpartisan Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. In the 47-page paper, Tom Sanzillo, the nonprofit’s director of finance and a former investment banker, argued that the plan outlined by PREPA’s oversight commission gave “renewable energy exceptionally short shrift” and instructed the utility to “turn almost entirely to natural gas … despite a legislative mandate to diversify Puerto Rico’s energy mix.” In the meantime, Sanzillo said Wall Street bondholders ought to expect losses and help pay back individual investors who “live in Puerto Rico, don’t have much means but invested because they were proud Puerto Ricans and had faith in their government.” But the underwriters and credit agencies who abetted decades of overzealous lending should “face criminal prosecutions.” “There needs to be some kind of accountability for the recklessness,” Sanzillo told HuffPost. “You can’t tell the bond markets you can’t get your money back at that level and nobody goes to jail. That’s just not how you do finance.”On Wednesday, however, the bondholders offered PREPA a different solution: $1 billion more in debt.This article has been updated to include White House approval of a request to waive the Jones Act for Puerto Rico.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-history-debt-electricity_n_59cc14f8e4b05063fe0ee086,HuffPost,Liberal
175,Puerto Rico crisis: What the Jones Act controversy is all about,Chris Isidore and Madison Park,9/28/17,"The Jones Act is an obscure, century-old law that requires all goods ferried between U.S. ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans.  Now critics say it's making it difficult to get critical supplies into Puerto Rico.    
 
  The Jones Act, when it was established in 1920, was meant to promote shipping by U.S.-owned and operated vessels.   But it's also had the unintended consequence of making it twice as expensive to ship things from the U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico as it is to ship from any other foreign port in the world, according to Republican Senator John McCain's office.   McCain and Democratic Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, as well as the governor of Puerto Rico and mayor of San Juan, have urged Trump to suspend the Jones Act to get supplies to Puerto Rico faster.    President Trump has not waived the rule, though he said Wednesday that he is ""thinking about"" it. He noted the shipping industry opposes a waiver.   ""We have a lot of shippers and a lot of people that work in the shipping industry that don't want the Jones Act lifted,"" he told reporters.    Trump did suspend the law after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida, to allow ships to move gas from the north while refineries and pipelines in the south were shut down.   Seven lawmakers, led by Velázquez, sent a letter Monday to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke requesting a one year waiver of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico.   A waiver, they said, would speed the delivery of fuel, food, medicines, clothing and building supplies.   In response, the Department of Homeland Security said the Jones Act was waived after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma to make up for fuel pipelines that were shut. Puerto Rico is having no problems getting gasoline, diesel fuel and other supplies   to the island, Homeland Security said. The problem is getting those supplies off the ships and distributing them on the island.   ""We do not lack U.S.-flagged vessel capacity to move commodities to Puerto Rico,"" Homeland Security said. Cranes powered by generators that are moving at half speed, as well as difficulty moving goods around the island, are the primary problems.    Critics say the Jones Act costs American jobs by encouraging residents in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hawaii to buy foreign-made goods that are shipped on foreign flagged vessels, rather than goods made in America.   That's what happens when it comes to gasoline and other fuels, said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for Oil Price Information Service.   ""Puerto Rico typically gets most of its gas from foreign sources -- Canada and Europe,"" he said. ""Jones Act ships are so expensive that it doesn't make sense to buy gasoline from U.S. refineries."" So, Kloza said, a waiver of the Jones act won't bring much more fuel to the island since Puerto Rico gets what it needs from other countries.   But plenty of other things are much more expensive in Puerto Rico because of the Jones Act. Cars, for example, cost about 40% more in Puerto Rico than on U.S. mainland, partly because of the law. It also affects other necessities.   A 2010 study by the University of Puerto Rico found that the Jones Act cost the island $537 million per year. The  territory has been in a recession  for 11 years and is suffering from a crippling debt crisis.   Still, the American Maritime Partnership, a coalition representing the domestic shipping industry, argues that the act supports national defense needs and ensures a vibrant maritime industry.

176,Hurricane Maria could be a $95 billion storm for Puerto Rico,Jill Disis,9/28/17,"Hurricane Maria could cost Puerto Rico $45 billion to $95 billion in damage -- a devastating blow to the island's already ailing economy.  The high end of the range, released Thursday by Moody's Analytics, represents almost an entire year's economic output for Puerto Rico.    
 
  The estimate underscores ""why officials are now suggesting that its economy may be set back decades,"" Adam Kamins, a senior economist at the firm, wrote in an analysis.   The damage estimate from Moody's is the highest yet. A more conservative estimate earlier this week from the disaster research group Enki Research  put the total at $30 billion .   Damage to Puerto Rico has been catastrophic. People are scrambling for food, water, fuel  and cash . Almost the entire island  is without power , and outages are expected to last for months in some areas.     The Moody's estimate says as much as $40 billion could be lost in economic output because of impassable roads and lost power. Property damage could total $55 billion.   For comparison: Moody's estimates that Hurricanes Irma and Harvey combined caused  more than $150 billion in damage  after those storms hit major U.S. cities in Texas, Florida and Georgia.   ""Given that Harvey and Irma disrupted far larger and more vibrant economies than that of Puerto Rico, this reflects the stunning amount of damage that Maria has wrought,"" Kamins said.    Puerto Rico's economy was already struggling. The island has been in recession for 11 years and has lost  10% of its population  in that time. In May, it  filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history .   Kamins said fallout from Hurricane Maria could make it all worse. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can freely move to the mainland.   ""The end result could be a permanent increase in the rate of population decline, with many of those who remain too poor to move elsewhere,"" he said. ""Puerto Rico's already murky future is now even more in doubt.""   The catastrophe modeling firm RMS released a damage estimate Thursday for the entire Caribbean that was also more conservative than Moody's. It said damage to the region could be $30 billion to $60 billion.   Maria devastated several islands in the region, including Dominica and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

177,Puerto Rico's looming medical crisis is 'about to explode',Susan Scutti and Alberto Moya,9/28/17," Dr. María Rodríguez shakes her head.  She's the medical director of Concilio de Salud Integral de Loíza, a community health center in a small town in the northeastern portion of Puerto Rico. Inside the clinic, with her hair pulled back and large glasses framing her eyes, she appears every inch a practical and compassionate health care provider. Yet today, she is struggling.  She's been told the center has just six hours worth of diesel. It's been a week since Hurricane Maria besieged the island, yet fuel distribution has been inconsistent throughout the island.  When those hours are up, Rodríguez will likely have to shut the doors. ""What else we can do?"" she asks. ""I haven't seen anything like this."" For 24 years, she's worked at the center, which serves about 15,000 underprivileged patients each year. Despite the possibility of a power outage, she and her co-workers are still trying to provide services. In normal conditions, the center provides everything from primary care and pharmacy services to X-rays.  ""We can do some things. I have a stethoscope and the antiseptics and I can prescribe. But the pharmacy can't work with that, they need the system -- they need labs to provide medications to these patients,"" Rodríguez says. ""The desperation that all these people have, they've lost everything -- on the whole island,"" she says.  With the fuel and power shortages, she expects the No. 1 health concern in the days ahead will be infectious diseases. As people who need medications do not get them, she predicts mental health issues will become a problem as well. ""It will get worse before it gets better,"" she says. Her feelings are shared by other health care providers on the island, who believe a medical crisis is about to unfold. But it isn't inevitable, since preventive steps can be taken now. That's the opinion of Dr. Robert Fuller, an emergency medicine physician at University of Connecticut and International Medical Corps.  A 'complicated mess' Fuller's been in medicine for 27 years, and though he has arrived at the scene of disasters for a dozen years, the conditions in Puerto Rico were a surprise, he says.   ""I didn't realize it was gonna be corner-to-corner everybody affected by the storm,"" says Fuller, squinting into the sunlight. ""Every family's been touched and disturbed in some way or another. And the degree of destruction -- the power the storm had -- took me by surprise."" Communities are disabled by the storm, he says, yet it's fuel and electricity that are driving this disruption.  ""If we had good logistics and good communications, things could probably settle out a little faster,"" Fuller says. However, the lack of those things could lead to a medical problem, since medications might not be delivered where needed. Puerto Rico is a ""complicated mess"" right now, he says. He has driven around the island, and there are wires down, which will make it hard to light up the houses. He agrees, fuel distribution is still a problem. He sees plenty of good doctors and nurses on the island, so it's not a matter of human resources. ""It's a matter of getting the medications and treatments to the people,"" Fuller says. It's also a matter of being able to move around and get services to people, which cannot happen without fuel.  In the shortest term, people with diabetes who don't have access to the right food and medication will be most vulnerable, Fuller says. A week without insulin, which requires refrigeration and a needle, can lead to a coma, which in turn can lead to death, he says. People relying on dialysis may also be in trouble. Naturally, if the lack of fuel and power continues, others will begin feeling the pain as well.  ""People are haggard and tired and maybe become impatient,"" Fuller says. ""I worry that it's quite possible it will get rough before it gets better.""  Then Fuller rushes off and climbs into a car, his destination a clinic where he might do some good. 'It is about to explode' At San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan, the waiting room is unexpectedly bright, though very few patients occupy the chairs. In a room, a baby wails. For 27 years, Domingo Cruz Vivaldi, executive director, has made this hospital his life's work.   ""The structure itself did not suffer very bad,"" says Cruz Vivaldi. ""But the main problem with the hospital is the electrical power."" He explains that in the wake of the hurricane, the hospital is relying ""100%"" on diesel to feed its emergency power generator.  Just two days ago, the hospital's diesel ran out and for about four hours in the early morning the hospital was dark -- no power, no electricity. Everybody, both staff and patients, were very nervous. Cruz Vivaldi worked hard with the hospital nurses to evaluate patients. Together they discharged or transferred 45 sick children. Other hospitals took in patients in unstable condition, while those not needing emergency treatment went home. ""We were lucky that a hospital nearby brought to us 1,200 gallons of diesel,"" says Cruz Vivaldi. ""That saved us."" The US Army has also  delivered a three-day supply of fuel  to the hospital. Once again, the hospital is close to 80 patients, he says, the sick children coming in from all over the island. His demeanor is calm throughout this difficult work of finding places to send patients. And, he's doing in the wake of personal tragedy.  Cruz Vivaldi's 86-year-old mother died just before the hurricane arrived.  ""I buried her the day of the storm,"" he says, unable to hide his tears. ""The day after the storm, I came here. We needed to be open. We had people looking for us."" Considering the needs of the entire island, Cruz Vivaldi says immediate help with diesel and power is what needs to happen first. ""We're getting help, we need more help,"" he says. ""As we get power back, we will be able to recover faster.""  Puerto Rico does not yet have a medical problem, Cruz Vivaldi believes. But as everybody repairs houses and stands in line for food, it's only a matter of time. ""It is about to explode,"" he says. The patients at home who are not receiving proper care will become sicker. He predicts an influx of patients will occur beginning in October.   ""We need to plan that the number of visits will triple or increase by four times in October, November and December,"" says Cruz Vivaldi. The health care system in Puerto Rico was already weak before the hurricane, he says. Now the problems will be magnified. ""We need more federal and armed forces here on the island,"" Cruz Vivaldi says. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on  Facebook  and  Twitter . Still, he remains hopeful. Cruz Vivaldi believes Congress and President Trump will provide funds and help rescue his home island. ""Puerto Rico is going to get better,"" he says, as if talking about a patient. Fuller, the emergency doctor, is pragmatic. For those mainland Americans who want to help their fellow US citizens in Puerto Rico, he requests they do so in practical ways.  ""Don't send stuff, send money. Money arrives cheap and money can turn into whatever we need it to be instantly. It doesn't sit in a hangar unused,"" Fuller says. ""You get much more value for the money ... even if it's not as emotionally satisfying.""",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/health/hospitals-puerto-rico-gupta/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWvqeq5sj6AhU2ZDABHdJ_Aks4yAEQFnoECAQQAg&usg=AOvVaw1l5QthfClBxWmYguZBKqEf,CNN,Liberal
178,Getting drinking water to more in Puerto Rico brings challenges,Veronica Rocha,9/28/17,"More than a week after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, nearly half of its residents still are without drinking water. At least 44% of the island's residents don't have access to potable water, according to the Defense Department. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN that crews are trying to restore water supplies for residents. But it hasn't been easy. ""In terms of aqueducts, we have been able to restore only 50% of water, because the majority of water in Puerto Rico also depends on electric generators,"" he said on Wednesday. Generators need fuel, which is on short supply. Elí Díaz-Atienza, executive vice president for Puerto Rico's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, told San Juan-based WKAQ radio the island's water facilities were significantly damaged during the hurricane. He said his agency was working to water distribution sites for residents. Díaz-Atienza said his water restoration plan includes using trucks to deliver water to residents in the island's rural areas. ""We understand the frustrations of the people... We would love it if everyone had water right now,"" he told the radio station. As government officials work to rebuild water systems throughout the island, the water situation has become dire with each passing day. The World Health Organization says a lack of safe drinking water and suitable sanitation could lead to significant health risks, some of which include diarrhea, hepatitis, malaria and malnutrition.  After a natural disaster, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises residents to listen to the local officials to find out if their water is safe to drink. The CDC suggests boiling water, using disinfectants or a filtration system to sanitize water. The CDC says bottled water is the safest choice. Although water and food supplies have been delivered to residents stranded on the island, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz told CNN more can be done. She said thousands of shipping containers with food, water and other supplies are sitting at the Port of San Juan due to ""a jurisdictional situation."" FEMA Director Brock Long said supplies are arriving in Puerto Rico, but delivering them to cities is the issue The hurricane wiped out roads and devastated the island's airports and shipping ports, which he said is hampering delivery efforts. The federal government, Long said, has established distribution sites and is conducting airlifts to distribute supplies. ""It's not just possible to pick up the supplies and move it forward,"" he said. ""That  last mile is a coordinated sequence process to be able to get to the points of distribution ... As the supply chains come back online, we will be able to increase the amount of supplies that are going. But listen, we are not going to be able to move as fast as everybody would like us, or as I would like. But we are pushing everything that we have.""

179,Puerto Rico aid is trapped in thousands of shipping containers,"Patrick Gillespie, Rafael Romo and Maria Santana",9/28/17," A mountain of food, water and other vital supplies has arrived in Puerto Rico's main Port of San Juan.  But a shortage of truckers and the island's devastated infrastructure are making it tough to move aid to where it's needed most,   officials say. At least 10,000 containers of supplies -- including food, water and medicine -- were sitting Thursday at the San Juan port, said Jose Ayala, the  Crowley  shipping company's vice president in Puerto Rico. Part of the reason for the distribution backlog is that only 20% of truck drivers have reported back to work  since Hurricane Maria swept through,  according to a representative for Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. On top of that, a diesel fuel shortage and a tangle of blocked roads mean the distribution of supplies is extremely challenging. Even contacting drivers is a problem because cell towers are still down.  Puerto Ricans waiting for aid ""When we say we that we don't have truck drivers, we mean that we have not been able to contact them,"" Rosselló said.  On Thursday the White House authorized  a 10-day waiver of the Jones Act , a federal law that limits shipping to US ports by foreign vessels. Puerto Rico's governor and other US officials had argued that a waiver would expedite supplies to the island. But as Ayala has indicated, shipping companies already have aid and supplies either waiting at the port to be delivered -- or held up at ports on the US mainland.   Of the 3,000 containers that Crowley alone had sent to San Juan's port as of Wednesday, only 4% had been dispatched from there, Ayala said. 'This hurricane was catastrophic' Ayala said the company can't get enough truck drivers or trucks filled up with diesel to pick up supplies for distribution across the island. ""The problem has been with the logistics, the parts of the supply chain that move the cargo from our terminal to the shelves or to the tables of the people in Puerto Rico,"" Ayala said Wednesday. ""This hurricane was catastrophic.""  How to help the victims of Hurricane Maria Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans are waiting hours in line to get gas, food and cash. Gas stations and supermarkets are rationing supplies, while banks are running low on cash.  Natalia Manteiga waited outside a supermarket Wednesday in Old San Juan that was letting in a few people at a time. She wanted to get water, tuna, and Chef Boyardee for her two children and her husband -- who had waited for hours Tuesday to get $20 worth of gas.  No gas. No food. No power. With stifling humidity and temperatures in the high 90s, it started to rain on Mantiega and dozens of other hopeful shoppers trying to get food.  Manteiga, who works for a tourism firm, said she's running low on cash, too.  ""It's difficult when you have kids. You want to make sure they have enough food,"" said Manteiga.

99,The Storm That Crushed Puerto Rico Isn't Getting As Much Attention As Harvey Or Irma,Ariel Edwards-Levy,9/28/17,"Americans aren’t paying as much attention to the hurricane thatdevastated Puerto Ricoand other Caribbean islands as they did to the storms that hit Texas and Florida, anew HuffPost/YouGov survey shows.Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico,the U.S. Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean that were already reeling from the brunt of Hurricane Irma, leaving conditions thatlocal officials described as “apocalyptic.” A week later, Puerto Ricoremains largely without power and thousands are still living in shelters. Many mainland Americans are desperately searching for loved ones.Just 27 percent of Americans say they’ve closely followed news about the effects of Hurricane Maria, the survey found. That’s down from 39 percent who say they watched Hurricane Harvey very closely and 43 percent who say the same about Hurricane Irma.Only 19 percent report knowing anyone who was affected by Maria, compared to 33 percent for Harvey and 44 percent for Irma.Other metrics suggest a similar drop-off. Google Trends, which tracks the level of interest in various search terms, shows that Maria never saw the same sort of steep spike in interest that Harvey and Irma did at their peaks.By comparison, here’s what searches from Puerto Rico looked like over the same period:According to analysis from FiveThirtyEight’s Dhrumil Mehta, Hurricane Maria ― and Puerto Rico ― saw far less coverage in TV and online news than those predecessor storms.Much of the media “has been occupied with other things: a health care bill that failed to pass, a primary election in Alabama, and a spat between the president and sports players, just to name a few,” Mehta wrote, noting that the phrase “national anthem” came up in TV news more often last Sunday than “Puerto Rico” and “Hurricane Maria” combined. According to another recent HuffPost/YouGov survey, just 14 percent of Americans said they’d heard more about the disaster in Puerto Rico than about the NFL protests or the GOP’s efforts to repeal Obamacare. Many Americans also don’t realize that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Three polls in the past few years put the percentage aware that Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship at between 43 and 54 percent. A new Morning Consult survey found that those who were reminded that Puerto Ricans are Americans were modestly more likely to support giving aid to their recovery efforts.Some critics of President Donald Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria have alleged that it pales in comparison to his administration’s actions after Harvey and Irma. The public gives positive ratings to both Trump specifically and the federal government as a whole for the handling of all three hurricanes, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. But they’re less strongly approving about the response to Maria.Just 14 percent of those who say they or someone in their family was personally affected by Harvey and 13 percent of those affected by Irma disapprove of the federal government’s response to those hurricanes. While the sample size of those similarly affected by Maria is small, nearly 40 percent in that group say they disapprove.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey by choosing the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 26-27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

174,8 numbers that show how Maria has laid waste to Puerto Rico,Saeed Ahmed and Michelle Krupa,9/28/17," What had been a verdant American paradise in the Caribbean is now a brown wasteland. One week after Hurricane Maria barreled through Puerto Rico, it's still in ruins. The devastated infrastructure is making it tough to move aid to where it's needed most. And the task of recovery -- from repairing inundated buildings to healing traumatized families -- seems perhaps as unfathomable as counting each sand grain on the island's iconic beaches.  Here's a look at what Maria left behind -- a week later:",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/us/puerto-rico-maria-by-the-numbers-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjo_6Sg7cj6AhU2ZjABHUdAAvQ4jgIQFnoECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw26NC-HKBWGjAf-ouXGmqFZ,CNN,Liberal
104,"Royal Caribbean Cancels Cruise, Sends Ship On Mission To Help Puerto Rico",Carla Herreria Russo,9/27/17,"Royal Caribbean, which operates cruise ships and tours around the world, canceled a voyage so that its ship can help with recovery efforts on the Caribbean islands devastated by Hurricane Maria. Royal Caribbean announced Wednesday that it will cancel its Adventure of the Seas cruise, which was scheduled to depart from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Sept. 30 and sail to various islands in the Caribbean, to free up the cruise liner to dock in ports in San Juan and on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix to aid in relief efforts.The ship will bring donated supplies to each port and bring evacuees from the islands to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ahead of ship’s next scheduled cruise on Oct. 6.Royal Caribbean spokesman Owen Torres told HuffPost the evacuees boarding their outbound cruise are individuals who were identified and placed on an evacuation list by local government officials. Some of these people are stranded tourists, the company said on Twitter.Torres also said a smaller number of employees and employees’ friends and families are being evacuated on the outgoing cruise, which has already reached maximum capacity at over 3,800 evacuees.“We opened up a small portion [of space on the cruise] to our employees” after they told the company that they had family members in Puerto Rico that needed to be evacuated, Torres said.He added, “As a company, it was the right thing to do, not only to evacuate residents in San Juan, St. Thomas and St. Croix, but also to take care of our families and friends that are over in Puerto Rico.”The company said it will give full refunds to the customers who were booked on the Sept. 30 cruise, including for payments for onshore activities. On top of that, Royal Caribbean will offer a 25 percent cruise credit for those who rebook trips within 30 days. Hurricane Maria caused island-wide destruction on Puerto Rico, leaving much of the U.S. territory without electricity and in dire need of aid. According to the Department of Defense, about 44 percent of the island’s population is without drinking water.Officials in Puerto Rico have described the conditions there as “apocalyptic,” and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said Tuesday that island residents are being discovered in “near-death conditions.”“The priorities right now are continued lifesaving action, meaning the delivery of commodities, restoration of power to critical infrastructure and of communication abilities, and restoration of fuel,” William Booher, director of public affairs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told HuffPost on Tuesday.President Donald Trump increased the federal funding for disaster response efforts in Puerto Rico this week and is scheduled to visit the island on Oct. 3.“That island was hit as hard as you can hit,” Trump said Tuesday. “Literally houses are just demolished. It was like tornadoes. It was like having hundreds of tornadoes.”Royal Caribbean said the company recently dispatched its Majesty of the Seas and Empress of the Seas ships to help with relief efforts after hurricanes Irma and Maria.“We have been such a part of the Caribbean and South Florida communities for so many decades. We are worried and anxious,” Royal Caribbean CEO Michael Bayley told The Miami Herald earlier this month while the company’s cruise ships were assisting with Hurricane Irma relief efforts.“At the end of the day, we want to try to help as much as we can,” Bayley added.So far, the company has assisted with evacuating 1,700 people and bringing tens of thousands of supplies to hurricane victims across the Caribbean and in Florida, according to its website.Puerto Rico was still reeling from the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma, which left $1 billion in damages, when Maria made landfall on the island Sept. 20.Find out how you can help the victims of Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico’s recovery efforts here.This story has been updated to include comment from Royal Caribbean.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/royal-caribbean-cancels-cruise-puerto-rico-aid_n_59cc47cae4b02aef6cd766ac,HuffPost,Liberal
103,9 Numbers That Put Puerto Rico's Daunting Recovery Into Perspective,Ryan Grenoble,9/27/17,"It’s been seven days since Puerto Rico suffered a direct hit from Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm it’s seen in nearly 90 years. The rest of the world is only beginning to grasp the enormity of the devastation on the island, where it could take months,if not years, to recover.“The devastation in Puerto Rico hasset us back nearly 20 to 30 years,” Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González told The Associated Press on Sunday. “I can’t deny that the Puerto Rico of now is different from that of a week ago. The destruction of properties, of flattened structures, of families without homes, of debris everywhere. The island’s greenery is gone.”Here’s what the recovery looks like (so far), by the numbers:7 DaysIt’s been a full seven days since Hurricane Maria slammed into southeastern Puerto Rico as a strong Category 4 storm.16 DeadPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Monday the official death count from the hurricane has edged up to 16. That’s likely to increase as recovery efforts continue.11,437 In SheltersAs of Tuesday, 11,437 people were still living in shelters on the island. That’s a decrease of only about 1,000 people since last Wednesday, when 12,500 people crammed into shelters to ride out the storm itself, suggesting that only 8.5 percent of those who sought shelter now have a habitable home or other accommodations to return to.80 Percent LossHurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of the value of Puerto Rico’s agricultural industry at an estimated loss of $780 million, The New York Times reports. Banana, plantain and coffee crops were hit the hardest, with entire plantations completely razed. 11 HospitalsOf Puerto Rico’s 69 hospitals, only 11 currently have power or fuel.12 ChildrenTwelve children at the San Jorge Children’s Hospital in San Juan depend on ventilators to survive. CNN reports the hospital ran out of diesel for its generators on Monday, but secured another two days’ worth of fuel at the last minute thanks to the generosity of another hospital.11 Billion GallonsThe Guajataca Dam in northwestern Puerto Rico is holding back approximately 11 billion gallons of water. Authorities warned last Friday that the dam had developed a crack thanks to added pressure from the hurricane and said it is in “imminent” danger of failing.44 Percent Without WaterAccording to the U.S. Department of Defense, an estimated 44 percent of Puerto Rico’s population is currently without drinking water. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority officials told Reuters on Tuesday that potable water won’t be available island-wide until power is restored, which could take months.2,400 MilesHurricane Maria wiped out nearly all of Puerto Rico’s 2,400 miles of power transmission lines, leaving the island almost completely without power.

102,"Recovery In Storm-Torn Puerto Rico Could Take Years, Aid Workers Warn",Jesselyn Cook,9/27/17,"It has been a week since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and millions of Americans who live there are still in need of aid. Disaster response experts warn that full recovery could take years.Much of the U.S. territory is still without electricity. Forty-four percent of the population lacks clean drinking water and just 11 of 69 hospitals have fuel or power, theDepartment of Defense reported Tuesday.Vital resources are dwindling as relief teams race to provide support and supplies. Temperatures in recent days have reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Local officials in Puerto Rico describe the storm’s aftermath as “apocalyptic” and say it has set the territory back “nearly 20 to 30 years.”“The priorities right now are continued life-saving action, meaning the delivery of commodities, restoration of power to critical infrastructure and of communication abilities, and restoration of fuel,” William Booher, director of public affairs at theFederal Emergency Management Agency, told HuffPost.There are 10,000 federal staff on the ground responding to the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were also hit by hurricanes Irma and Maria. But aid delivery has been very challenging, Booher said, because “all of it has to be delivered by air or by sea.”President Donald Trump has increased federal funding for disaster response efforts in Puerto Rico and will visit the island on Tuesday, Oct. 3.“That island was hit as hard as you can hit,” he said on Tuesday. “Literally houses are just demolished. It was like tornadoes. It was like having hundreds of tornadoes.”Desperate residents have started collecting water from mountain streams to survive, CNN reports. Many have spent hours lined up at gas stations with plastic containers, hoping to collect whatever fuel is available for their cars or generators. And thousands are now homeless, living in overcrowded, under-resourced shelters.“There is an urgent need for aid in Puerto Rico,” Jerry Anderson, associate vice president for humanitarian response at Save the Children, told HuffPost. The nonprofit’s staff are responding to the “dire situation” in the capital city of San Juan by distributing critical items like water purification systems, tarps, diapers and various other hygiene supplies.“There are about 700,000 children living in Puerto Rico,” Anderson said, “and they are currently stranded without electricity, clean water, fuel or phones to call for help.”It’s difficult to identify the worst-hit area, he added, because the whole island has been affected by Hurricane Maria ― the most destructive storm to strike the territory in almost nine decades. “The entire electric grid is still down, communities are still flooded, fuel is running low and phone service has been affected,” making it difficult to assess the full extent of the destruction, he said.“American children and families have been displaced and lost everything. These critical life-saving materials and services need to get to Puerto Rico and cannot get there fast enough,” said Anderson.Hundreds of staff members from the American Red Cross are also working on the ground with government officials and other disaster response partners to provide health care services and distribute tarps, flashlights, batteries, blankets and other supplies.Puerto Rico’s most urgent needs are the restoration of energy and communication, according to Brad Kieserman, the Red Cross’ vice president of disaster operations and logistics. “Many people are going to need generators in their homes for months and possibly years” amid this “humanitarian catastrophe,” so fuel will be essential, he said.Removing debris from the roads is a priority to clear the way for delivery of further humanitarian aid. “It is a massive debris removal mission,” Kieserman said. “Just massive.”The government and disaster response organizations have already distributed food and millions of bottles of water, as ground wells and plumbing systems have suffered extensive damage. “The limiting factor is how you get [these supplies] from the points of entry into the remote portions of the island,” Kieserman said. “All of these strategies take time to fully work.”It’s “way too early” to know how long Puerto Rico’s recovery period will last, but he expects it could take several years because of damage to the vital agricultural sector. Satellite imagery suggests that “there is no agriculture in Puerto Rico right now, and there won’t be for the foreseeable future,” said Kieserman.In this catastrophe, like many others, “the very resources that you need to respond have been destroyed or compromised by the very event you’re responding to,” Kieserman added.“Is [the response] going as fast as everyone would wish? No,” he said. “But I do think it’s going as fast as it reasonably can, given two major hurricanes and all of the challenges moving resources across several thousand miles.”Here’s how you can help people in Puerto Rico.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-disaster-recovery_n_59ca8e12e4b0cdc77335390e,HuffPost,Liberal
180,Ham radio operators are saving Puerto Rico one transmission at a time,Paul P. Murphy and Michelle Krupa,9/27/17," The phone call from the Red Cross came in late Friday night, just as the full scale of Hurricane Maria's calamity began taking shape. ""We need 50 of your best radio operators to go down to Puerto Rico."" In the days after  the worst storm in three generations hit the American island  -- and for many more to come -- public electrical, land-line and cellular communication systems showed few signs of life. And radio networks used routinely by police officers, power company workers and other first responder still were down. Yet, a key mode of communication -- one not reliant on infrastructure vulnerable to strong winds and flooding -- still crackled: the ""ham"" radio. Answering the phone that night in Connecticut was the emergency manager for the American Radio Relay League, the group's CEO said. For more than a century, this group has served as a hub for amateurs licensed to operate the dependable, if archaic, medium known as ham radio and eager to pitch in when disaster strikes. When the Red Cross made its latest appeal for heroes, these were the people it had in mind. Jumping to respond to disaster Already gearing up on his own that night to go to work, turning knobs and flipping switches, was Oscar Resto. As one of dozens of ham -- shorthand for ""amateur"" -- operators across Puerto Rico, Resto had been authorized by the Federal Communications Commission  to use radios, computers, satellites or the Internet to assist and support public safety during emergencies .  Often untethered from wires and cables, operators share information by voice, Morse code and other methods on a wide range of frequencies above the AM broadcast band. Such communications were  critical during rescue operations after the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina .  For three days after Maria hit, Resto sawed through the downed trees that separated his home from the road, he told CNN. Then he packed his car with radio gear, left his family and made the 25-mile journey to a makeshift Red Cross headquarters, where generators and batteries could power his equipment. ""I have the responsibility to establish the required emergency communications that the American Red Cross needed for understanding the needs of the citizens impacted by the hurricane,"" said Resto, a section manager for the  American Radio Relay League , which boasts 160,000 members. Survivors needed food, water, shelter and fuel to power generators after Maria knocked out the entire electrical grid. They also needed to communicate, to share critical information about  diabetics nearing the end of their insulin reserves , babies threatened by dehydration,  families rationing crackers . Transmitting radio signals to other ham operators in the Caribbean, Resto and his shortwave brethren traded National Hurricane Center reports on Maria's position. He also contacted a ham operator in Florida, and asked ""just to tell my daughter, Astrid, that we were fine,"" he recalled. Before long, Resto and his compatriots realized their messages were the only ones getting off the island. In an instant, their mission expanded: Anyone with the requisite skills and equipment was conscripted. Shoulder to shoulder with first responders Two ham volunteers, Raul Gonzalez and Jose Santiago, set up a radio control hub run by generator power in Monacillo, near San Juan, and other centers quickly followed suit. There, ham operators work shoulder to shoulder with public safety and utility officials to transmit information to other ham operators working with teams in the field. A full week after Maria battered their homes, Resto and two dozen other Puerto Rican ham operators were still running radio operations for the police and the local power company, whose own wireless communications systems rely in part on computers and power sources knocked out by the storm. For instance, ham operators riding with police use radios tuned to the special broadcast frequencies to transmit calls to other ham operators hunkered down at the command centers with officers, who in turn respond with orders. A power company generator low on fuel? A ham operator from Resto's team deployed with the power company calls his counterpart at the command center and coordinates a fuel delivery. For his part, Resto learned Tuesday via a ham radio at the command center that an unsanitary hospital in western Puerto Rico was transferring patients to another hospital. It was just one of countless threads of information squawked across the operational frequencies in a massive effort to deliver relief and supplies. ""I am very proud of them,"" Resto said of his crew of amateurs. ""They are the real heroes."" More help on the way Less than 48 hours after the American Radio Relay League's emergency manager fielded the Red Cross' call, 350 ham operators had offered to help, said Tom Gallagher, the group's CEO. Fifty of them prepared this week to embark upon a three-week deployment to Puerto Rico. They include retired executives and public safety officers, and hail from places from Washington to Texas to New Hampshire, he said. ""It's an incredibly personal sacrifice from individuals who are dedicated to serving communities,"" Gallagher said. ""They have the skills and the motivation and the sense of responsibility."" Volunteers will be outfitted with self-sustaining kits provided by radio manufacturers and dealer partners so they can be agile and won't burden those they're trying to help, he said.  Southwest Airlines was due to transport the equipment for free Wednesday from the group's New York headquarters to Atlanta, where volunteers planned to convene Thursday to board a chartered JetBlue flight for San Juan, Gallagher said. There, they plan to connect with the Red Cross and likely spread out across Puerto Rico to continue the life-saving work of radio operators already well underway, Gallagher said. ""It's the first time they've asked us to do this on this scale,"" he said. ""This is why we're here.""",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/27/us/puerto-rico-maria-ham-radio-operators-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi844e27sj6AhXlRDABHaErAIw4mAIQFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw2EZjUCQk-rriefYW8PW5nh,CNN,Liberal
181,Puerto Rico town's desperate plea for help is finally answered,Andrea Diaz,9/27/17," Help finally arrived to a desperate town in Puerto Rico after a single photograph signaled just how badly supplies were needed. The words ""S.O.S. Necesitamos Agua/Comida,"" which translates to ""we need water and food,"" were written on the pavement of the small town of Humacao. The image was taken on Sunday and has been shared widely on Twitter. Angelina Ruiz-Lambides, an associate director of the Cayo Santiago Field Station, captured the scene while she was flying over Punta Santiago to survey the damage from Hurricane Maria.  Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló saw the SOS image on social media and decided to take action and deliver help himself. ""You may have seen the images on social media, it was a big SOS sign that they wanted food and water,"" Rosselló said. ""We went there, got food and water, established some of the security protocols ... we're really focusing on what needs to get done right now, which is making people have their life support."" With the help of the National Guard, the island's governor was able to deliver a complete shipment of supplies to the people of Humacao on Wednesday.   ""The governor saw the photo and he wanted to deliver the supplies himself to make sure they arrived to the right location,"" said Magdiel Lugo, the governor's photographer.  Rosselló stressed that the government is trying to get food, water and fuel to people across the island.  For now  97% of people remain without power  throughout the island and about half the residents do not have water.

182,Royal Caribbean sends cruise ship to help Puerto Rico,Danielle Wiener-Bronner,9/27/17,"Royal Caribbean is using a cruise ship to help evacuate people from Puerto Rico and deliver needed supplies to Caribbean islands.  The cruise line announced on Tuesday that it is canceling its   September 30   Adventure of the Seas trip so it can use the ship   to help victims of Hurricane Maria.     The 3,800 passenger vessel   will bring aid to San Juan, as well as St. Croix and St. Thomas, which were hit by both Maria and Hurricane Irma. Adventure arrives in San Juan on Wednesday and will take evacuees to Fort Lauderdale before returning to Puerto Rico next week.   The evacuations come as  people remain stranded  inside Puerto Rico's main airport, which is  running on fumes . Only ten flights made it in and out of the San Juan airport on Tuesday, and just 18 are scheduled for Wednesday. Security checks are being done by hand because TSA equipment was damaged in the storm and airlines are having a hard time printing boarding passes.     A week after Maria hit,  people are desperate  for provisions.   Royal Caribbean is donating water, medical supplies and more to those in need.   The company started offering aid after Hurricane Irma devastated a wide swath of the Caribbean earlier this month.   So far, it has helped evacuate more than 1,700 people and has promised to match donations of up to $1 million to help with Irma relief.   Other cruise lines are also pitching in.    Norwegian Cruise Line is working with the disaster relief group All Hands Volunteers to help rebuild schools and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. The company is donating $600,000 toward rebuilding efforts in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean, and has promised to match up to $1.25 million in donations to All Hands Volunteers and Happy Heart Fund's relief efforts from its guests, team members and partners.   Following Hurricane Irma, Carnival deployed 11 ships to bring supplies to islands in the Caribbean. The ships have been making stops in Antigua and St. Kitts to drop off deliveries to Barbuda and St. Maarten during regular cruise trips.   In addition to making donations, Carnival Corporation joined the Micky and Madeleine Arison Family Foundation and Miami HEAT Charitable Fund in pledging up to $10 million in funding and support for Florida and the Caribbean following Irma.

190,Puerto Rico's main airport is barely functioning,Chris Isidore,9/26/17,"The largest airport in Puerto Rico is still crippled almost a week after Hurricane Maria.  Passengers hoping to escape the devastation have packed the main terminal, which has no   air conditioning since it's running on limited emergency power.     The conditions were intolerable, said David Mannasmith, an Ohio insurance adjustor who works surveying areas hit by natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes. He and his wife Amber were in Puerto Rico for their third anniversary.   They rode Maria out at their resort and left for the airport Friday morning hoping to come home. Instead, they spent four days there, sleeping on hard floors, with little food and water -- and heat and humidity that made it feel like it was over 100 degrees.     ""There was one vendor that was open, selling bottled water, very limited food,"" he said. ""Everything was operating on a cash only basis. Fortunately we had taken out a lot of cash. A lot of people, some with small children, were running out of cash.""   Mannasmith said he was told several times he and his wife would be able to get on the next flight only to lose out. Finally on Monday morning they got on a flight to Miami.   ""We were drenched by the time we reached the plane. The air conditioning was the best part,"" he said. He said he felt bad for all the other passengers left behind.   ""There are people we stood on line with for four days, and they're still there,"" he said. ""And they're getting no help.""   There are a limited number of flights in and out of the island because of damage to radar and other equipment, airport authorities told CNNMoney. On Monday there were only 10 commercial flights between San Juan and the mainland United States, with 10 more scheduled for Tuesday,   Airlines have started flying larger than normal planes to handle as many passengers as possible on the few flights that can get in and out.   Authorities hope to resume international flights on Wednesday. They had originally aimed to do so on Monday.   At the same time, many more military, charter and relief operation jets are also flying in and out of the airport, according to the FAA.   Commercial airlines are operating many of those relief flights, carrying tons of needed supplies, including bottled water and non-perishable food, medicine, blankets, cots, electrical generators and blood for the Red Cross.   And they are sending volunteers to help with relief and recovery, many of whom are airline employees with family on the island.   United and Southwest Airlines said they are only operating humanitarian relief flights in and out of the island -- no passenger flights. United's flights have carried 50 pallets of blankets and other supplies for the Red Cross, and nearly 40 tons of water, food, diapers, rope, tarps, and 50 power generators. The relief flights are returning with as many people as they can get on the plane, United said.   But conditions in the airport are very difficult. Airlines are having difficulty   printing out boarding passes that fliers need to go through TSA checkpoints and board flights.   TSA said that some of its equipment has been damaged by the storms, so some screening is being done by hand. The TSA said it is bringing in about 1,100 staff members to work in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and other areas affected by the hurricanes that have slammed U.S. territories over the past month. It said 500 of those employees will deal with the more time consuming screening procedures, with the rest assisting in relief efforts. It is advising that passengers allow two hours for screening.   Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on Wednesday, Sept. 20, two weeks after Hurricane Irma hit the islands before battering Florida. Late last month, Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage along Texas and Louisiana's Gulf Coast.    The airport in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands has yet to resume commercial flights. The tower there was damaged by Hurricane Irma, and the FAA brought in the mobile tower to help manage traffic. But it had to take that tower back to the mainland ahead of Hurricane Maria to protect it from damage.   The FAA airlifted a mobile air traffic control tower back to St. Thomas over the weekend to support relief and recovery missions there.   Finding housing in St. Thomas for airport staff is has also been a challenge. The controllers who staff the tower in St. Thomas are being shuttled back and forth to San Juan every day.    -- CNN's Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.

189,"'Apocalyptic' devastation in Puerto Rico, and little help in sight",Chandrika Narayan,9/26/17," Hurricane Maria whipped Puerto Rico with Irma-level winds, drenched the island with Harvey-level flooding, crippled communications, decimated buildings and damaged a dam that puts downstream residents at risk of catastrophe.  But help has been slow to come to communities where the devastation is described as ""apocalyptic,"" officials and residents argue. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said the island faces a humanitarian crisis. He urged Congress to approve a commensurate aid package as the US commonwealth,  already hammered by a prolonged economic crisis , tries to get back on its feet.  The governor joined others in emphasizing that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.  ""We need something tangible, a bill that actually answers to our need right now,"" he said. ""Otherwise, there will be ... a massive exodus to the (mainland) United States."" Leading Democrats called for swift action to help the island.  Hillary Clinton urged the Defense Department to send a Navy medical ship , while Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for Republicans to join with Democrats to pass a robust relief package. ""The Trump Administration must act immediately to make available additional Department of Defense resources for search-and-rescue operations, law enforcement and transportation needs,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands deserve to know that their government will be there for them, without question or hesitation."" White House: Response 'anything but slow' President Donald Trump has pledged federal help for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. A White House official said Trump  is planning to visit Puerto Rico , but a date has not been set because of infrastructure concerns on the island. Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert and FEMA administrator Brock Long were traveling to Puerto Rico, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.  ""The federal response has been anything but slow,"" Sanders said. ""There's been an unprecedented push through of billions of dollars in federal assistance."" Airplanes and ships loaded with meals, water and generators have been arriving or are headed to Puerto Rico and other affected Caribbean islands, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement. More than 10,000 federal employees are in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin islands helping with research and rescue efforts and moving goods, FEMA tweeted. In a tweet Sunday, Clinton said, ""President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens."" The Guajataca Dam Puerto Rico faces a more immediate danger. The Guajataca Dam  in the island's northwest corner is releasing water after suffering a ""critical infrastructure failure"" following the Category 5 storm. ""Some of the dam has fallen apart,"" Rosselló said. ""Now we are making sure that we can assess if the other part will fall down as well. It represents a great danger for about an estimated 70,000 people."" Residents below the dam were told to evacuate on Friday, according to the National Guard. With more than 95% of wireless cell sites out of service, authorities had to physically go to thousands of homes to warn people of the potential collapse .   Rosselló said that while most people in the vicinity had evacuated, efforts were still underway to get people out in peripheral areas. Communications cut Without power and communications in much of the island, millions of people have been cut off from the world since Maria hit Wednesday.  ""It is as if Puerto Rico got hit with the strength of Irma's winds, leaving a trail of devastation worse than much of the destruction Irma left in Florida,"" said CNN meteorologist Judson Jones.  ""The rainfall in some areas of Puerto Rico rival the amounts of rain left by Harvey in Houston. And now they are contending with a dam disaster that is reminiscent of  California's Oroville Dam crisis  earlier this year."" After flying over Puerto Rico on Sunday, CNN's Leyla Santiago said residents could be seen along the highways searching for a cellphone signal. ""The island from above is a completely different color"" due to the lack of trees, Santiago said, while pools are filled with black water and debris. The storm ripped the roofs of houses, exposing their interiors to the sky, she said. Authorities who flew over the island Saturday were also stunned by what they saw. Roads are completely washed away and others are blocked by debris, isolating residents. ""It was devastating to see all that kind of debris in all areas, in all towns of the island,"" Jenniffer González, the island's nonvoting representative in Congress, told CNN.  Hospitals crippled At least 10 people have been confirmed killed by the hurricane. A doctor at Canovanas Medical Center -- one of the few hospitals with a working generator -- said they were running out of fuel to keep it going. Dr. Norbert Seda told CNN that the center only had 2-3 days left of medical supplies and medicine.   Read more: Survivors of Hurricane Maria need assistance None of the three hospitals CNN visited had running water and all said they had just days of supplies left. However, earlier, Rosselló guaranteed that the people of Puerto Rico would have access to enough food and water to survive.  ""We have centers that will distribute water and food, we've already started getting shipments. Today, as a matter of fact, we had a million liters of water come in to Puerto Rico. We have half a million servings of food and other resources."" Rosselló also said the island has enough fuel for the next 20 days. Roselló met with more than 50 mayors and representatives from across Puerto Rico on Saturday. Some said there have been incidents of looting in both homes and stores.

187,More Americans live in Puerto Rico than 21 states (and other things to know),Ryan Struyk and graphics by Will Mullery,9/26/17," When Hurricane Maria barreled across Puerto Rico, devastating buildings with wind and flooding and wiping out the power infrastructure, the safety and livelihood of more than 3.4 million Americans hung in the balance. But has Puerto Rico's lack of statehood caused the federal government and broader American public to overlook its fellow citizens? President Donald Trump  pledged to visit the island next Tuesday , saying the island was ""literally destroyed"" and making more disaster assistance dollars available. He congratulated the federal government on its response, saying ""I think we've done a really good job"" and citing praise from local government officials. But the main airport on the island is barely functioning and shipments of aid are struggling to keep up with the millions there who need food and shelter. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the devastation on the island a ""humanitarian crisis,"" promising that the victims will get the same help that people in Texas and Florida received. In many ways, like population and gross domestic product, Puerto Rico appears like just any other middle-of-the-road state that may blend in with many you'd see on the American mainland. But its economic problems left it extremely vulnerable to a storm like this. Here's a look at how Puerto Rico ranks up against the 50 states. A state without statehood? Less than a three-hour flight from Miami, the island of just more than 5,000 square miles is smaller than every American state except for Delaware and Rhode Island. Still, in many ways, Puerto Rico is very similar to a US state.  It's home to more than 3.4 million people, according to the US Census Bureau -- a population larger than 21 states, including Iowa, Arkansas and Nevada. That number has declined in recent years as more residents move to the US mainland amid economic woes on the island. The Puerto Rico population has steadily declined over the last decade from 3.8 million people. Just in the last year, according to the US Census Bureau, the population declined by a broad 1.8 percentage points. (Only six states had declining populations from 2015 to 2016, but none of the US states' populations were declining as quickly as Puerto Rico's; West Virginia being the worst at just 0.5 points.) Puerto Rico's gross domestic product -- at $103 billion, according to the World Bank -- would rank 37th if Puerto Rico were a state, ahead of places like New Mexico, South Dakota and New Hampshire, according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Puerto Rico came under US control more than a century ago, and Puerto Ricans have voted a half-dozen times on statehood -- most recently a low-turnout nonbinding vote in June where residents overwhelmingly voted to become to 51st state. Ultimately, however, Congress must pass a law admitting them to the union. For the time being, residents of the island are natural-born citizens just like anyone born in a US state, but they don't have a voting member in Congress or votes in the Electoral College, which elects the president. Like the 50 states, Puerto Rico has hits own constitution, governor and legislature. The economic vulnerability of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has stark economic woes that separate it from most of the 50 states -- and make the island particularly vulnerable to a large storm that wipes out infrastructure and devastates personal property. A broad 44% of its residents live in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. That's more than double the 21% of residents in Mississippi and Louisiana who live in poverty -- the highest in the United States. The island also has been plagued by debt and a declining credit rating amid an economic recession there. Trump had tweeted earlier that Puerto Rico was in ""deep trouble"" after the storm, in part because its electrical grid was ""in terrible shape"" and they have ""billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks."" Indeed, the median household income on the island is just $19,350, according to the US Census Bureau -- less than half the median household income of those in Mississippi and Louisiana, again at the bottom of the list.  The median income for the entire United States is more than triple the island's number, and the median income in the most wealthy states in the country hit nearly four times as much money. Unemployment in Puerto Rico also remains high at 10.1% -- worse than any state and more than double the national unemployment rate in the United States of 4.4%. Still, it's been a slightly improvement over the last several years after it reached a peak of 17.0% in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico last week as a Category 4 storm, the largest storm to hit the US territory in nearly a century.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/politics/puerto-rico-state-hurricane-maria/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWvqeq5sj6AhU2ZDABHdJ_Aks4yAEQFnoECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw1O399Gxxv0S2EWEyugCPrn,CNN,Liberal
186,"US military sends ships, aircraft to Puerto Rico","Barbara Starr, Zachary Cohen and Ryan Browne",9/26/17," The US military is planning to deploy the USNS Comfort hospital ship to assist with FEMA's response efforts in Puerto Rico a week after Hurricane Maria smashed the island as a Category 4 storm, several defense officials told CNN.  The Comfort is a seagoing medical treatment facility ""capable of providing resuscitation and stabilization care; initial wound and basic surgery; and postoperative treatment,"" according to the US Navy.   Puerto Rican officials asked for additional medical assistance from the ship after initially indicating that they wanted to focus on getting power restored to damaged hospitals on shore, US officials told CNN.   While the Comfort is on the way, according to FEMA administrator Brock Long, it may not deploy for another week -- within five to nine days as additional forces are activated to help man the ship along with its current crew of about 18 civilian mariners. The crew is expected to grow to as many 60 and the medical crew could increase from the approximately 65 now with the ship to as many as 1,200, according to officials. Hillary Clinton urged the Defense Department to send a Navy medical ship, while Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for Republicans to join with Democrats to pass a robust relief package. The Navy hospital ship is just one part of the military's humanitarian assistance effort -- deploying assets to both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands after the storm decimated critical infrastructure in the region.  The USS Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group has already been conducting rescue operations in the region, including eight medical evacuations and 148 airlifts, and delivered 44,177 pounds of relief supplies and cargo to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands since Maria struck, according to the Pentagon. The US Air Force is also sending additional aircraft to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to ramp up the volume of daily relief missions.  Speaking on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joseph Dunford said the priority is making sure airfields can operate. ""The responsibility is primarily DHS, but at this point we're not trapped in bureaucratic niceties, what we're trying to do is make sure that we get the people of Puerto Rico the support they need when they need it,"" he said.  ""All the other support they need can't come in until we get the ports and airfields open, so that's why Northern Command has placed that at the top of the list in terms of the support we're providing,"" he added. Dunford said he expects more military aircraft will be used particularly for ""generators, water, food, those kind of immediate needs."" Priorities for Puerto Rico  In addition to deploying the USNS Comfort for additional medical assistance, the Defense Department is supporting FEMA's immediate priorities for Puerto Rico including: debris and route clearance of critical transportation routes; re-opening air and sea ports; re-establishing utilities, and implementation of a commodities distribution plan.  ""Northern Command continues to conduct 24-hour operations, aggressively conducting search and rescue operations, bringing additional essential commodities to the islands, and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports and other critical facilities,"" according to the service.  The US military is sending a variety of additional aircraft vehicles to assist with ongoing missions aimed to deliver critical supplies and capabilities to Puerto Rico: One C-17 Globemaster  with the remaining Contingency Response Element to establish airport operations.  This unit includes more than 50 personnel. One C-17 and one C-5   with the Mobile Emergency Response Support unit  to provide mobile telecommunications, life support, logistics, operational support and power generation.  One C-17 with the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command  from Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This unit includes approximately 20 personnel with tactical trucks and utility trailers to provide site assessments. One C-17 with the 63d Signal Battalion  from Fort Stewart, Georgia. This unit includes approximately 15 personnel, tactical trucks and utility trailers to provide satellite ground communications capabilities. Two C-5s with the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade  from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to provide tactical airlift with eight helicopters. Two C-130s with the FAA's Incident Staging Base Cache  from Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia. This unit includes approximately 50 personnel and four heavy duty trucks and equipment.  The Air Force is also further increasing airport throughput capacity in San Juan by assisting the Federal Aviation Administration with air traffic control repairs. Priorities for US Virgin Islands The US military is also deploying additional aerial and medical assets to the Virgin Islands to assist in ongoing relief efforts: Four C-17s  with water and meals to St Croix. Two C-17s and one C-130  to St Thomas with National Guard units that include approximately 120 personnel.

185,Trump says US 'working hard' on Puerto Rico disaster response,Betsy Klein and Daniella Diaz,9/26/17," President Donald Trump vowed Tuesday that federal assistance is on its way to Puerto Rico, a day after he broke his recent silence about the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria since it made landfall on the US territory. Trump also announced that he would visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday, saying it was the earliest he could reach the battered island. ""Thank you to Carmen Yulín Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc. We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way,"" he wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning, moments after Yulín Cruz appeared on CNN's ""New Day."" Sharing harrowing details of rescue efforts in her city, Yulín Cruz praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency's ""great job"" and ""logistics help."" ""Our bodies are so tired, but our souls are so full of strength that we will get to everyone we can get to,"" she said. Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico last week,  whipping the island  with Irma-level winds, drenching it in Harvey-level flooding, crippling communications, decimating buildings and damaging a dam that puts downstream residents at risk of catastrophe. Without power and communications for much of the island, millions of people have been cut off from the world since the hurricane hit. After days of public silence on the hurricane, Trump tweeted criticism Monday evening, casting blame on the island's poor infrastructure and economic instability. ""Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble. It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA,"" he wrote in a series of tweets.  Responding Tuesday, Yulín Cruz said, ""These are two different topics. One topic is the massive debt, which we know we have and it's been dealt with. But you don't put debt above people, you put people above debt."" Trump traveled to Texas and Florida in the immediate aftermath of the major storms that struck them earlier this month, but officials said Monday the devastated territory was not yet capable of hosting a presidential visit. In announcing his upcoming visit on Tuesday, Trump said he may also stop in the US Virgin Islands. Asked about a potential visit from the President, Yulín Cruz defended Trump and emphasized the need for federal funding. ""I am sure that as the United States President, you know, he can come to Puerto Rico if he wants to. He has been not only tweeting, but I know he has been in contact with the governor, and we appreciate that. Let's make sure that this is not a handout, this is a moral imperative, and it is a plea for help and it a plea for us to be done right,"" she said. The President is scheduled to receive a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts from homeland security adviser Tom Bossert later Tuesday morning. Bossert traveled to Puerto Rico alongside FEMA Administrator Brock Long on Monday to assess damage and federal needs. The administration has not yet sent a disaster spending request to Congress, and it's not clear whether Bossert will have a fixed dollar amount to present to the President during his Tuesday briefing. As of Monday morning, FEMA had $5.03 billion available for disaster spending between now and the end of September, an agency spokesperson told CNN. When the new federal fiscal year begins on October 1, the disaster relief fund will be replenished with an additional $6.7 billion. Two senior House GOP sources tell CNN they expect to get the official request from the Trump administration in mid-October. A senior administration official says that is the White House's expected timing as well.  Defending the federal response in Puerto Rico as ""anything but slow"" Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration will be able to determine appropriate funds ""once we have a greater insight into the full assessment of damage."" Muted response Trump's relatively muted reaction to Maria -- he tweeted frequently over the weekend on myriad other topics, most notably his  ongoing feud with the NFL  -- has drawn comparisons to his responses to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which primarily battered Texas and Florida, respectively. As those hurricanes hit the states, Trump often tweeted comments on the size and impact of the storm as well as praising first-responders.  Before his latest messages this week, Trump last tweeted about Maria on Wednesday, the day it made landfall in Puerto Rico. The next day, he mentioned the situation to reporters while taking a photo with the Ukrainian president, saying the island was in ""very, very, very tough shape"" adding that its electrical grid was ""destroyed."" But he didn't make any public comments about the island over the weekend. Some Democrats worry that Puerto Rico is not getting the same amount of swift attention that Florida and Texas received. ""The fact of the matter is the administration has not been able to comprehend the fact that people in Puerto Rico are dealing with life and death issues,"" Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the House, told CNN's Kate Bolduan Tuesday morning. ""The most fundamental duty of the President of the United States is to protect the homeland,"" she added. In response to Democrats' concerns, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, who chairs the House appropriations committee that is working on an aid package, said the island's residents will get the same help as those in the mainland US. ""The people of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands remain in our thoughts as they struggle to recover from successive Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The challenges they face are truly tremendous. But they should be reassured that they are entitled to equal treatment under the law and the Appropriations Committee and House leadership will assure that every step of the way,"" he said. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Gregory Wallace, Kevin Liptak, Chandrika Narayan and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/politics/donald-trump-puerto-rico-maria-response/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjYmfa27Mj6AhUjTDABHf24AXk4hAIQFnoECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw0va7vqSMWY4iJeFreOXsJb,CNN,Liberal
184,No gas. No food. No power. Puerto Ricans fear their future,"Mallory Simon, Rachel Clarke, Jason Kravarik, Jennifer Rivera, Rafael Romo, Leyla Santiago, Monica Serrano, Brian Vitagliano and Bill Weir",9/26/17," Power is out. Food is short. There's not enough water to drink, let alone wash. A week after Hurricane Maria smashed Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, the situation is not much better. In many ways, it's getting worse.  Hospitals that should be saving people are instead unable to provide care.  At the Canovanas Medical Center, doctors face a lack of supplies.  Dr. Norbert Seda said they were running out of fuel for the generator and had only two or three days of medicine and supplies left.   Puerto Rico in crisis after Maria While residents were prepared for the storm's arrival and mercifully few were killed directly by the hurricane, the need for medical treatment is getting greater.   ""We've seen a lot of trauma,"" Seda said. ""We need medication, antibiotics, tetanus shots, we've seen a lot of trauma basically, (we need) antibiotics and medication for hypertension.""   He's not encountered people dying because of a lack of power and supplies -- yet.   ""It's coming. When there's a shortage of water and sanitation issues, it will come out. We are expecting something like that to happen.""  Lack of fuel is the key problem at San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan, according to its executive director, Domingo Cruz Vivaldi. ""We are dealing with a crisis right now. The hospital is needing diesel every day -- 2,000 gallons a day. Yesterday, we ran out of diesel at 6 a.m. and we were without electricity at the hospital from 6 a.m. through 2 p.m. Eight hours without electricity.""  Without power, lifesaving machines like ventilators have to run on emergency backup power. Fears for the future are playing out across Puerto Rico. Misery is stalking each and every one  of the more than 3 million Americans there. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz sees a  growing need for help  for increasingly desperate people.   ""We are finding dialysis patients that have not been able to contact their providers. We are having to transport them in near-death conditions,"" the mayor said. ""We are finding people whose oxygen tanks are running out because our small generators now don't have any diesel.""   Most alarming are the SOS messages, she said, ""the ones that say 'Can anyone hear me?' The ones that say 'I have no more food and I'm out in the street.'""   Yulín Cruz and her teams are out on the streets trying to find the neediest people. But in the mountains south of her city, help is less likely to come.   Combat war veteran Miguel Olivera  has less than two days' supply of his lifesaving insulin left . And even that may spoil in his refrigerator with no power.   The mayor of his town, Javier Garcia, believes help will come from the mainland and the federal government.   The question is when, and whether it will be too late for Olivera and others.   The main airport in San Juan is crippled, barely functioning .  Those there are hoping to escape a crowded terminal with no air conditioning. On Tuesday, only 10 flights were scheduled.   Check-in desks were packed with people waiting in line, hoping for a flight off the island. Fans were running, but keeping no one cool. Hopeful travelers sat in chairs on line and others lay nearby, using their suitcases as pillows. A mother rocked a stroller back and forth to try to calm a child. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday  there was food and water on the way to Puerto Rico  and added that  he would visit the island next week .   Until aid arrives, Garcia and his fellows in Aguas Buenas are reverting to an older way of life -- hacking coconuts to eat and collecting water from mountain streams. But that can only sustain so many for so long. Twenty-first century help is needed for many, like Miguel Olivera, who rely on medication. And the situation can so easily get worse -- mosquito-borne diseases like Zika and Dengue fever are very real fears here.   A massive power tower that was toppled in Aguas Buenas will take a helicopter to restore. That's one very obvious problem. But Puerto Rico's power grid was a mess well before the storm and it will be months -- several months -- before electricity is restored across the island.   Generators are now essential -- and essential to them is gasoline. Gas stations around San Juan do have some supply, but the demand is overwhelming.  Long lines of vehicles queue up at the pumps and men with red plastic gas cans wait for up to six hours, hoping to get a few precious gallons. Similar lines grow outside any open grocery store and anywhere that has ice.   It's hot. And it's humid. Temperature were set to rise to the low 90s on Tuesday. Showers are forecast later this week but they will barely make it any cooler.   Puerto Rico's leaders and many of its people say they are resilient, they will survive, they will rebuild.   But signs of desperation are beginning to show.   A reporter climbing out of a helicopter is grabbed in a bear hug by a weeping woman in Quebradillas, a cut-off town. The woman doesn't know who the reporter is, but she is a person from the outside, perhaps someone with news of supplies, who can take a message to family, who can offer something.   From the air, you can see people walking along highways, reaching up, searching for a cellphone signal. Floods, storm debris and the ever-present lack of power mean a fleeting phone conversation may be their only link to the rest of the island for some time.   The same struggle evident in Quebradillas is playing out across Puerto Rico.   Utuado suffered several deaths in the storm itself and saw homes washed away. Rosario Heredia lost her home. She is diabetic and just had surgery. She's still there, hoping for help, from anyone. But so far, no one has come.   Now this community of 30,000 is turning to a pipe, tapped into a mountain spring alongside a highway, for water. Harry Torres said the water is all they have for cleaning and drinking until help comes. He and his fellow residents are just ""trying to survive.""  ""We're desperate,"" Torres said. The situation is dire for those who cannot even make it to that trickling water. The hurricane brought mudslides here, leaving some unable to get to the highway due to blocked roads or lack of gas. Lydia Rivera has two cars, but no gas and cannot reach that pipe for water. Now she's trying to keep her two grandchildren alive on a ration of crackers and survive on rainwater. In Yauco, already a remote town, all the roads are blocked. The only way in is climbing up a hill, and over many downed trees.   Coffee growers Gaspar Rodriguez and Doris Velez have lost just about everything they've worked for. But their biggest worry now is how they will survive.   They are in desperate need of food. Most of what they have has gone bad.   In Yabucoa, which took a direct hit, there is no power and residents say they have also been without fresh water for days. The little food in town is being shared by neighbors.   Every single part of Puerto Rico took a hit. From the air it looks brown, not the verdant green of the tropical island it is.   Nothing is normal and there is little sign of when any sense of normality will return -- from schools opening to hospitals being able to care for the sick. Millions don't know when they'll be able to turn on a tap and get water, or flick the switch and have light or cooler air.   San Juan resident Sebastián Pérez showed CNN how he's surviving without running water and power. His fridge is useless for keeping anything cold and he hasn't driven his car since the storm, wanting to keep the gas for emergencies.   ""Food-wise it's getting kind of scary,"" he said. ""I'm trying to use as less as I can.""   ""Because I don't know when it will get better.""

183,Trump: I will go to Puerto Rico next Tuesday,Betsy Klein and Kevin Liptak,9/26/17," President Donald Trump said he will travel to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico next Tuesday. Speaking in the Roosevelt Room, Trump said it was the earliest date he could reach the devastated island due to first responders' ongoing relief and recovery efforts.  Trump said the US territory was ""literally destroyed.""  ""I know many Puerto Ricans, and they're great people and we have to help them. It really was devastated. Some people say, I read it this morning, it's literally destroyed,"" he said, adding, ""The infrastructure was in bad shape as you know in Puerto Rico before the storm, and now in many cases, it has no infrastructure, so it's, you're really starting from almost scratch."" He said he may also stop in the US Virgin Islands during the Tuesday trip. Trump, speaking later Tuesday during a news conference alongside Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, said a ""massive effort"" is underway in Puerto Rico to help the flattened US territory recover. The federal government is ""doing everything we can"" to help the island's hard hit people, Trump said. ""All available federal resources, including the military, are being marshaled to save lives."" He said he was directing all relevant federal agencies to participate in the recovery efforts, and insisted the relationship between FEMA and the island's agencies was strong. ""We have been really treated very, very nicely by the governor and everyone else,"" he said. He said the nation had been tested by hurricanes over the past month, but said the ""resolve of the American spirit"" could not be broken. Unlike the efforts following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Trump said, recovery is more challenging in Puerto Rico due to its geography.  ""It's very tough because it's an island. In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there, you know, we've got A-pluses on Texas and Florida and we will also on Puerto Rico, but the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean, and it's a big ocean, it's a very big ocean, and I think we're doing a really good job,"" he said during his Roosevelt room comments. He touted FEMA's work, noting the ""hourly"" landing of water and food supplies to Puerto Rico's airport runways, which he described as ""devastated"" and ""broken."" Earlier Tuesday, Trump vowed that federal assistance is on its way to Puerto Rico, a day after he commented for the first time in days about the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria since it made landfall on the US territory. ""Thank you to Carmen Yulín Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc. We are working hard.

188,"Puerto Rico suffering humanitarian crisis after Maria, San Juan mayor says",Madison Park and Jason Hanna,9/26/17," Nearly a week after Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico, the US commonwealth looks something like this: Most homes are without power and phone service, with little hope of having it restored soon.   Food and medicine are dwindling, especially for those isolated by impassable roads. And rescuers still are finding and removing desperate people from their demolished communities. It is, in short, a humanitarian crisis, San Juan's mayor told CNN on Tuesday. ""We are finding dialysis patients that haven't been able to contact their providers, so we are having to transport them in near-death conditions,"" Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said, recalling a group's visit to two San Juan-area nursing homes this week. ""We are finding people whose oxygen tanks are running out, because ... small generators now don't have any diesel."" Searchers are trying to visit every structure in the capital area, she said. ""Our bodies are so tired, but our souls are so full of strength, that we will get to everyone that we can get to,"" Yulín Cruz said. Read: No gas. No food. No power. Puerto Ricans fear their future Two people died in an intensive care unit in a San Juan hospital after it ran out of diesel, Yulín Cruz said. Their causes of death weren't immediately available. It wasn't clear whether those deaths were among the at least 16 deaths that Karixia Ortiz, spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety and Vilmar Trinta, spokesperson of Puerto Rico's Police superintendent, attributed to the storm. Maria struck September 20, knocking out power for nearly all the 3.4 million residents and demolishing structures on an island already struggling after Hurricane Irma's brush earlier this month.  Nearly 1.6 million electric customers in Puerto Rico are without power, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Energy Department, not counting those using generators as a backup. Even before the hurricane hit, the island's electrical grid was functioning with ""Band-Aids,"" Héctor Pesquera, the territory's public security secretary, told CNNE. President Donald Trump said Tuesday  he will visit Puerto Rico on October 3, just as he inspected damage and rescue efforts in Texas and Florida after recent hurricanes in those states.  Residents in remote areas are stranded with shrinking supplies, and some haven't been able to contact their families to tell them they survived. Coffee growers Gaspar Rodriguez and Doris Velez said the food they had left has spoiled.  ""You work, work and work, and it's for nothing,"" Rodriguez said after losing everything.  Rescuers still are ""removing people from hazardous conditions -- (people who) are ill, that can't move on their own,"" said Carl Levon Kustin, a FEMA task force leader from California. ""We've been working feverishly to get out to these areas,"" Kustin said Tuesday. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN that more  support and resources for the island  are needed.  While crediting the Trump administration and FEMA for responding ""quickly"" and ""appropriately,"" Rosselló said, ""There are some challenges and we need more resources."" Trump says US 'working hard' on Puerto Rico disaster response 'We have not lost our faith' Near the town of Utuado, Rosario Heredia, 56, who is diabetic, is in her house, which is spewing water from every corner. She reaches high into her closet for a piece of clothing and squeezes water from it like a soaked sponge.  Heredia had hoped that help would've arrived by now -- but it hasn't.  Trees are broken and twisted on the island, leaving behind a wasteland. Roads have washed away, and others are blocked by debris. After losing everything, some Puerto Ricans say the only thing they have left is their faith.  ""Really, we are people who serve God,"" Wilfredo Villegas said. ""And yes, we are saddened because when you lose every little thing you may have, it's not easy to recover ... but we have not lost our faith."" White House: Puerto Rico response has been 'phenomenal'  Until Monday night, Trump hadn't tweeted or made public remarks on the  shattered island for several days .  He began his tweets with references to Texas and Florida, where Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck recently.  ""Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.."" ""...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars...."" ""...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA"" Asked about Trump's comments on Puerto Rico, Yulin, the San Juan mayor, said Tuesday that hurricane relief and the debt crisis are "" two different issues. "" ""You don't put debt above people -- you put people above debt. ... Let's deal with the two issues in a separate way, because there is a humanitarian crisis,"" she said. Survivors of Hurricane Maria need assistance Top aides to Trump, including homeland security adviser Tom Bossert and FEMA Administrator Brock Long, went to the island Monday to assess immediate needs. ""The response today has been phenomenal,"" acting Homeland Security Director Elaine Duke said Tuesday. Long said the administration's objectives continue to be to ""take care of people and stabilize the situation and do everything that we can to sustain life.""  Amateur radio operators help out Because the storm knocked out radio systems used by police and utility workers, amateur radio operators are helping them communicate with each other. Oscar Resto is the American Radio Relay League's section manager in Puerto Rico. He and about 24 fellow members of the amateur radio group in Puerto Rico have been running police and utility radio operations since Maria hit.   Trained and licensed operators have been riding with police officers and utility workers with battery- or generator-powered kits.  And the American Radio Relay League is just getting started. On the US mainland, CEO Tom Gallagher's phone lit up around 10 p.m. Friday.  It was the Red Cross. ""We need 50 of your best radio operators to go down to Puerto Rico,"" Gallagher says a Red Cross representative told him.  Less than 48 hours later, 50 of them had signed up for a three-week deployment to Puerto Rico.   ""Everything from rich guys to firefighters,"" Gallagher says. Gallagher's team went to work with their manufacturers and dealer partners, scrambling to compile the self-sustaining kits the operators will need in Puerto Rico. Long lines at San Juan airport Hundreds of people have packed the main terminal at San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport this week, hoping to escape the devastation -- but leaving hasn't been easy. Because of damage to radar and other equipment at the airport, only about 10 commercial flights between San Juan and the US mainland could take off and land Monday -- and the same number is scheduled for Tuesday, airport authorities  told CNNMoney .  People are waiting in a main terminal that -- because it is running on limited emergency power --   has no air conditioning. ""Everyone is in the same boat, trying to get out,"" Leyla Colon, standing in line at the airport Monday, told Reuters. She said she couldn't buy tickets before she arrived at the airport, because she didn't have Internet or cellphone service. ""At this point I'll buy a ticket on any flight to get out of here,"" Colon told Reuters. Dozens more flights with relief material -- meals, water and generators -- have come into the airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The first commercial flight from San Juan to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport since Maria landed Monday night, to the relief of the 200 passengers' relatives. Sarita Mongelli's parents, in their 80s, were on the flight. ""I can't describe the feeling after five days (of) not talking to them,"" Mongelli told  CNN affiliate WABC . ""I can't tell you what they've gone through -- horrible, horrible conditions -- and at this age, it's very hard for them."" Mongelli said her parents want to return to Puerto Rico but won't be going back anytime soon. ""Whatever's left of their life right now, they need to be safe with their children, not alone,"" she told the TV station. ""We can't ask for more, I got them home -- I'm taking them home with me now."" 'We're on a mission' At Atlanta's international airport, aid workers were preparing Tuesday to board a charter flight to San Juan. Among them were 31 members of the New York City Fire Department, many of whom are of Puerto Rican descent.  ""As Puerto Rican New York City firefighters with family that live in Puerto Rico, devastated by Hurricane Maria, we're on a mission to do what we can as best as we can, to get to all the people we can,"" said Lt. Joe Montalvo, a fireman from Battalion 57 in Brooklyn. The firefighters loaded supplies onto the plane, including special cases of blood in refrigerated containers.   Montalvo said he had yet to speak with relatives living on the island. ""Phone service is still down, cellphone service is limited,"" Montalvo said. ""My family (lives) in the southwest corner of the island, and we haven't heard anything from anybody."" He added, ""We're hopeful they're OK.""

105,Tweeters Tear Into Donald Trump For 'Blaming' Puerto Rico Over Maria Devastation,Lee Moran,9/26/17,"Twitter users are accusing PresidentDonald Trump of blamingPuerto Rico for the humanitarian crisis unfolding there in the wake ofHurricane Maria.Instead of urging his followers todonate to Puerto Ricans in need, Trump decided touse the microblogging service on Monday night to comment on the island’s debt and infrastructure problems.With many of the island’s 3.4 million residents without power or clean water, many people online suggested Trump was blaming them “for their own misfortune.”And they were quick to call him out on his comments:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-puerto-rico-twitter-maria-hurricane_n_59c9f4ffe4b01cc57ff4eefb,HuffPost,Liberal
106,The Crisis in Puerto Rico,"Greg Acevedo, Contributor",9/26/17,"The New York Times reported today that the Governor of Puerto Rico is warning the situation there was in danger of becoming a humanitarian crisis: “Puerto Rico, which is part of the United States, can turn into a humanitarian crisis,” Governor Rosselló said. “To avoid that, recognize that we Puerto Ricans are American citizens; when we speak of a catastrophe, everyone must be treated equally.”In my opinion, it’s disheartening that the Governor has to remind anyone, citizens or politicians, that Puerto Ricans are US citizens. This speaks the continuing disenfranchisement of Puerto Rico; it has always been a neo-colony to which the US only offers second-class citizenship.The way the US has managed Puerto Rico’s financial crisis exposed the true nature of Puerto Rico’s status. The US response to Maria has already begun to expose Puerto Rico’s disenfranchisement. The recent plea by Congressional members (Nydia M. Velázquez D-NY, Luis V. Gutiérrez D-IL, José E. Serrano D-NY, Darren Soto D-FL, Adriano Espaillat D-NY, Joyce Beatty D-OH, and Joe Crowley D-NY) to temporarily suspend the Jones Act is a clear example of the need to circumvent neo-colonial arrangements to bolster second-class citizenship.The devastation from a natural disaster like Maria will be amplified by the devastation that US neo-colonialism and neoliberal capitalism have already wrought.",[],HuffPost,Liberal

As many of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents arewithout power and clean water, roads remain impassable and cellular service largely remains out, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló on Monday pleaded with Washington to send more federal aid. In his comments Monday night, Trump insisted that deliveries of food, water and medical supplies are being handled well and instead pointed at the island’s ongoing financial problems.He tweeted: Trump also didn’t use his social media presence to encourage his followers to donate to Puerto Ricans in need. (If you’re looking for ways to help, you can find some here.)In the hours leading up to the three tweets about Puerto Rico, the president continued his attacks on NFL protests and slammed CNN as “fake news.” Immediately after the tweets, he attacked Sen.

108,Hundreds Remain Stranded At Puerto Rico's Largest Airport,Mollie Reilly,9/25/17,"Hundreds of people were stranded in Puerto Rico’s largest airport on Monday as the U.S. territory continued to grapple with power outages, water shortages and other devastating effects inthe aftermath of last week’s Hurricane Maria.Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, which normally operates nearly 200 commercial flights a day, sustained significant damage, including to its air traffic control systems. The airport closed for several days in the immediate wake of the storm, largely due to flooding in the terminal and debris on the runway. Some daytime commercial flights were allowed to resume over the weekend, but the vast majority of flights remained halted. According toFlightAware, 89 departures and 97 arrivals were canceled Monday alone, stranding travelers hoping to secure a spot on one of the few flights still scheduled to take off. The situation for those travelers appeared increasingly dire. There’s still no electricity on the island, forcing the airport to use a backup generator to power essential services — but not air conditioning, creating extremely uncomfortable conditions inside the building as temperatures topped 90 degrees on Monday. ATMs were out of service, meaning travelers couldn’t access cash to purchase food, The Washington Post reported. And according to CBS News’ David Begnaud, travelers weren’t given any food or water. (Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello later said he’d ordered for snacks and water to be delivered to those waiting at the airport.) Some slept in the airport multiple nights so as not to miss an available spot on an outgoing flight.Airport officials didn’t immediately return a request for comment on when operations will resume or if there are plans to improve the conditions for travelers. But on Saturday, they urged travelers to avoid the airport unless their flight remained scheduled. Computer systems remained down on Monday, slowing down bookings and other routine processes. Airline personnel adopted stopgap measures to continue operations, such as giving travelers handwritten boarding passes.As Puerto Rico faces a long road ahead — repair work will take months and cost tens of billions of dollars, according to some estimates — it’s unclear when airlines will be able to resume normal operations.Southwest has suspended all flights in and out of San Juan indefinitely, citing the airport’s poor conditions.American Airlines, meanwhile, operated a relief flight carrying supplies to San Juan on Monday morning, and returned to Miami with over 300 passengers. A second relief flight is scheduled to depart Miami for San Juan on Tuesday morning.Delta Airlines also operated a relief flight Saturday, bringing supplies, generators and personnel to the island. The company said it is planning additional flights on larger aircraft to accommodate more travels. The airline also said it plans to bring food and “amenity kits” for travelers and airline employees stuck at the airport, and is instituting fare caps from the island to the continental U.S. JetBlue scheduled nine relief flights Monday and Tuesday, and instituted caps on fares to and from the island.

""President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens,"" Clinton said in a Sunday morning tweet, referring to the Department of Defense, Secretary James Mattis and a US Navy ship that  serves as a medical facility . The White House has not returned CNN's request for comment on Clinton's remark.  The Pentagon is on the ground in Puerto Rico, dispatching members of the Army Corps of Engineers' 249th Engineer Battalion, who are working to restore power, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a news release Friday.  President Donald Trump  is planning to visit Puerto Rico , but because of infrastructure concerns, the date has not been set, a White House official told CNN.  Florida Sens. Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat, sent a letter to the President on Wednesday specifically requesting assistance for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.   Four thousand US Army Reserve members  have been deployed  to the island, the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said.

Additionally, US Northern Command, which provides military support for civil authorities, is working with FEMA and government officials in the relief efforts, the release said.  Hurricane Maria cut off power and communications for millions of people after walloping Puerto Rico on Wednesday.  More than 3.3. million people  live on the island territory, and at least 10 people have died from the storm, according to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello's office.

192,Hurricane Maria: Puerto Rico officials describe 'apocalyptic' conditions,Nicole Chavez,9/24/17," Days after Hurricane Maria pounded the island of Puerto Rico, killing at least 10 people, authorities are starting to see firsthand the scope of devastation that left the US territory off the grid.  Without power and communications in much of the island, millions of people, including city leaders and first responders, have been cut off from the world since Maria hit Wednesday.   Authorities flew over the island Saturday, and were stunned by what they saw.  No cellphones, water or power. Roads completely washed away and others blocked by debris, isolating residents. ""It was devastating to see all that kind of debris in all areas, in all towns of the island,"" Jenniffer González, the island's non-voting representative in Congress told CNN.  ""We never expected to have a lot of debris in so many areas. A lot of roads are closed, older ones are just gone,"" she added. At least 10 people have been confirmed killed by the storm, according to Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's office. Roselló met with more than 50 mayors and representatives from across Puerto Rico on Saturday. Some described the conditions in their communities as ""apocalyptic"" and said there have been incidents of looting in both homes and stores. ""We know a little more today than we did yesterday,"" Rossello said. ""This is going to be a long road.""  A dam is in danger of collapsing, adding to the crisis. Read more: Survivors of Hurricane Maria need assistance Army, more federal aid coming US President Donald Trump has pledged federal help for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said 4,000 members of the US Army Reserves have been deployed to the island to help with Hurricane Maria recovery. ""Federal partners are aggressively working to meet and overcome challenges to opening ports and restoring power to bring additional life-saving commodities and personnel into disaster-affected areas,"" the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement. Several flights and sea vessels with meals, water and generators have been arriving or are headed to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands affected, the agency said. Brock Long, the FEMA director,  said on Twitter  Sunday he would visit Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands on Monday. Puerto Ricans living without water, communication Residents also have limited access to cell signal, causing panic among families at home and abroad who have been unable to contact their loved ones. ""I know many people who are living in the States are worried about not hearing from their families,"" González said. ""Don't get nervous, we just have problems with communications lines.""  More than 95% of the wireless cell sites are currently out of service, the island's Federal Communications Commission said Saturday.  East of Maunabo, in Humacao, people stop their cars along the side of the road near a cell tower on a hill. It's the only access to cellphone service for miles. ""We're trying to communicate to our families in the US,"" said Jose Flores, who traveled 17 miles to reach the tower. ""I just got connected to my daughter in Florida, and she will let the rest of the family know I'm fine."" On the northwest part of the island, authorities had to physically go to thousands of residents to warn them of a potential  dam collapse near the Guajataca River.  ""We don't know how much longer it will hold,"" he said. ""The structure has been significantly compromised.""  Maria marching north The National Hurricane Center says the storm could impact the US East Coast in the coming days. ""Interests along the coast of the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic should monitor the progress of Maria."" the center said in an  advisory . The Category 2 storm was carrying maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was 290 miles east of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. It was moving at 9 mph (15 kph), the center said. As the storm slowly moves away from the Bahamas into the Atlantic, forecasters say southeastern US beaches will likely see ""dangerous surf and rip currents"" over the next several days. Maria is expected to stay offshore but ""the uncertainty is how close to the North Carolina coast Maria's turn will occur,"" the center said.

193,"Devastated by hurricanes, Puerto Rico again looks to Washington for help",Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett,9/22/17," President Donald Trump is planning to visit Puerto Rico, which he says was ""absolutely obliterated"" by Hurricane Maria, and the administration and Congress are making plans to assemble an aid package for the island. A White House official told CNN that the island may not be prepared for a presidential visit quite yet. ""He is committed to going, but date is still unclear,"" the official said. ""As you note, there are significant infrastructure concerns."" The President spoke with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello on Thursday, and there are growing concerns that the process of restoring power to the island could take months. The presidential attention could offset concerns that the US territory, which has no voting representation in Congress, might not get the same attention or financial relief as some states, like Florida and Texas, that were also recently struck by hurricanes.  Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican already focused on securing help for his home state, has also made a point to press for money for Puerto Rico. In a series of tweets this week he noted he was working with Rossello and the territory's lone representative in Congress, Republican Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon. ""Spoke to @WhiteHouse yesterday. @Potus coming to #PuertoRico very soon. You will NOT be forgotten. We will rebuild better than ever!"" he tweeted. House Speaker Paul Ryan  said at a Hurricane Harvey cleanup event  in Texas that he was still waiting for an official request from the Trump administration on what kind of disaster aid package it would like Congress to approve for victims in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. A senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN on Friday that the spending panel has not received any specific requests yet, and federal agencies are still assessing the needs. After Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the Federal Emergency Management Agency burned through disaster money quickly and Congress approved $15 billion more. Recently the pace of FEMA's spending has slowed, but aides expect to get additional requests for money. Ryan said Congress is expected to vote on two bills with more money in October. On top of dealing with back-to-back blows from Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Puerto Rico is still struggling to stabilize from its debt crisis. Last spring Congress negotiated a deal with the Obama Treasury Department to help stabilize the situation, but Ryan stipulated that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out the government there, and there has been little evidence that Capitol Hill will weigh in again to prop up the financial system. But in terms of providing disaster aid, there is bipartisan support to swiftly deliver help. Rubio and Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson wrote a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging for specific assistance for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. ""It is important that the federal government stands ready to assist in the difficult days after Hurricane Maria passes, when hope must be available to combat despair,"" they wrote. An aide to Rubio told CNN on Friday that it's too early to know what the territory's disaster relief needs will be, and the funding conversation will begin after the damage is fully assessed. The aide said Puerto Rico is expected to need a lot of money. In a separate letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the GOP and Democratic senators jointly wrote: ""As the National Center for Disaster Fraud continues its important work with the U.S. attorneys' offices and other federal, state, and local agencies related to Hurricane Irma, we respectfully urge you to expand the scope of the task force in Puerto Rico to account for any illegal activity related to Hurricane Maria.""  Illinois Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez sent a letter  Friday to Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pressing them to organize a bipartisan delegation to visit the island. ""It was a powerful direct hit that struck Puerto Rico when it was already down because of the economic situation, financial crisis, limited autonomy because of the federal takeover, and a barely adequate public health, power, and public services infrastructure,"" Gutierrez wrote. ""What little Puerto Rico had before Maria was literally blown away and in order to understand the scope of the damage and the magnitude of the recovery, Members of Congress need to see it with their own eyes."" Signaling the importance politically of the ties of Florida to those living on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gwen Graham sent letters earlier this week to the state's entire congressional delegation urging them to secure assistance.   ""Just as we helped our neighbors in Florida, we must now stand with our neighbors in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, who just days after enduring Hurricane Irma, have been hit by Hurricane Maria, another devastating storm,"" Graham wrote. In her letters, Graham cited how many Puerto Ricans reside in the members' districts, indicating that more than 11,000 live in GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz's district and as many as 186,000 are in Democratic Rep. Darren Soto's district.  Soto is the first Floridian of Puerto Rico descent to serve in Congress.

112,Tens Of Thousands In Puerto Rico Told To Evacuate Immediately As Dam Cracks,Ryan Grenoble,9/22/17,"About 70,000 people in Puerto Rico’s northwestern municipalities of Isabela and Quebradillas were being urged to evacuate immediately Friday after the Guajataca Dam there was found to be in “imminent” danger of failing.Engineers found a crack in the 88-year-old structure during an inspection after Hurricane Maria left the island Wednesday. The storm dumped more than 20 inches of rain across a wide swath of the island. A complete failure of the dam would unleash a deadly, fast-moving wave of water as the 2-square-mile lake it once held back is funneled downhill.Per the National Weather Service, the dam began failing at 2:10 Friday afternoon. Authorities were busing as many people as they could to safety. Those who had the means to evacuate were told to do so immediately:Compounding problems, Hurricane Maria destroyed 95 percent of the U.S. territory’s cell towers and all of Puerto Rico is without power, frustrating efforts to notify those downstream.“We don’t know what the details are,” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said at a news conference Friday. “We are evacuating everywhere.”The Army Corps of Engineers considers all of Puerto Rico’s 37 dams to be “high hazard potential dams” ― not because they’re all at risk of failure but because of the risk they pose to human lives, the economy and the environment should they fail.Jery Stedinger, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Cornell University who has studied dam safety, told HuffPost that Puerto Rico’s dams are particularly vulnerable because Hurricane Irma also swiped the island just two weeks ago.“We’re seeing a lot more hurricanes these days, and this was back to back,” he explained. “The first one probably got the ground wet, and it really enhances the runoff from the second one.“So when doing dam safety studies, one worries about more than one flood. If you’ve just had a big hurricane come through and the ground is saturated and the reservoir fills up when the second one rolls through, you’re in a really vulnerable position.”A study by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials found extreme weather events like these are by far the most common causes of dam failure.“Those are designed to get you through the maximum conceivable event that would happen,” Stedinger added. “But we’re dealing with people and physical systems, and sometimes worse things happen than we imagine was conceivable.”Travis Waldron contributed reporting.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/guajataca-dam-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-evacuate_n_59c58844e4b06ddf45f7fe7b,HuffPost,Liberal
113,10 Numbers That Explain Hurricane Maria's Devastating Toll On Puerto Rico,Ryan Grenoble,9/22/17,"Authorities are still assessing the toll exacted by Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico this week, but it’s certain that the damage inflicted has been both massive and is likely to grow. “We still don’t have a lot of information,” Puerto Rico’s Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN Wednesday night. “We’re virtually disconnected in terms of communications with the southeast part of the island.”President Donald Trump signed off on a disaster declaration for the island on Thursday, but addressing the needs of the devastated island has only just begun.Here’s a breakdown of the impact (so far) by the numbers:15At least 15 deaths have been reported so far as a result of Maria. That number is expected to grow as recovery efforts proceed.3.4 millionThat’s both the population of Puerto Rico and the number of people currently without power. Maria devastated Puerto Rico’s already fragile electrical grid, cutting off power to 100 percent of the island.6It could take up to six months for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the island’s sole energy service provider, to restore power. (Complicating matters, the power authority is around $9 billion in debt.) 80 ― 90 PercentCarlos Mercader, a spokesman for Puerto Rico’s governor, told PBS that in the hardest hit communities on the island, almost all of the houses have been destroyed. “80 or 90 percent of the homes are a complete disaster,” he said. “They are totally lost.”12,500Some 12,500 people fled their homes to ride out the storm in one of Puerto Rico’s 500 shelters. Given the extent of the damage to homes, Mercader said he expects many people will be forced to live out of the shelters for weeks to come.155 mphThat was Maria’s sustained windspeed when it made landfall as a Category 4 storm Wednesday morning, just shy of being considered a Category 5 storm, the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.1928Hurricane Maria was the first Category 4 storm to hit the island since 1932, and the strongest since a Category 5 storm hit Puerto Rico in 1928. $74 billionThe amount of debt the economically troubled U.S. territory had before the storm, not including an additional $50 billion in pension liabilities.$1 billionThe amount of damage already inflicted on Puerto Rico by Hurricane Irma, which skirted the island just two weeks ago. $15 millionThe woefully small size of Puerto Rico’s emergency fund.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-by-numbers_n_59c541bde4b01cc57ff1fcb5,HuffPost,Liberal
114,Puerto Rico's Power Outage Could Be A Death Sentence For Many,Lydia O'Connor,9/21/17,"Puerto Rico is facing the possibility of months without power after Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory as a Category 4 storm Wednesday morning.The storm has passed, but the consequences of a compromised electrical grid, experts say, will be inconvenient at best, and deadly at worst.Hurricanes like Maria, whichbarreled into Puerto Rico packing 155-mph winds, generallyknock out power when winds tear down power lines and when floodwaters compromise transformers, substations, buried power lines and power plants, often causing a ripple effect throughout the electrical grid.For the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the island’s sole energy service provider, that ripple effect shut off power for 100 percent of its customers. With $9 billion in debt, PREPA may not be able to restore power to the island forup to six months, officials warned. “The day-to-day can unravel in an instant,” Julie McNamara, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told HuffPost on Thursday. “You go into a store and pay with a credit card ― that’s not going to work,” McNamara said. “You don’t have internet. You want to get cash? The ATMs are out.”Power loss also affects water supplies, sewage treatment and food preservation, creating serious health and nutritional concerns.People who were already medically fragile now face the greatest threats. While hospitals will likely be equipped with some generators, people receiving at-home care face serious risks, Jeff Schlegelmilch, the deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, told HuffPost.“I think the most life-threatening situation is going to be for people who are on home oxygen concentrators, home ventilators” and other medical devices that require electricity, he said.Many such people will likely be able to receive care at emergency medical centers powered by generators, but the island will have to import the fuel to make that possible, McNamara said. “The longer an outage lasts, the harder it is to maintain that supply,” she said.In one instance, 89 kidney disease patients at Puerto Rico’s Fresenius Kidney Care clinic were transferred to the Fresenius location in Miami to continue their lifesaving dialysis treatment after Maria hit. Those same 89 patients had just been transferred from Saint Thomas, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, after Hurricane Irma pummeled that island earlier this month. A lack of air conditioning can also be deadly, as recently seen in Hollywood, Florida, where nine nursing home patients died in the wake of Hurricane Irma. Areas hit by hurricanes tend to have warm climates and are especially hot after a storm, Schlegelmilch noted. “For anyone who is normally very fragile to begin with, in increasingly hot conditions, it can become a life-threatening issue,” he said.Secondary to medical concerns is the power outage’s impact on the economy, which is already in crisis. The island has over $74 billion in debt and an additional $50 billion in pension liabilities, for a total of roughly $34,000 in debt per resident. “There’s been chronic underinvestment in Puerto Rico’s electricity infrastructure,” McNamara said. “[The power outage] is the exclamation point on a steady decline just because of chronic underinvestment.”Now, Puerto Rico must make sure the fallout from Maria doesn’t destroy what stability is left. “Any sort of disaster recovery can be, if it’s not handled right, absolutely devastating to the economy and can be a real barrier to the growth of the economy,” Schlegelmilch said. “Businesses that can’t reopen [after Maria] may never reopen.”That presents the possibility of another dangerous ripple effect. “If you’re able to get [the economy] chugging along and get people to work and get kids in school, then you have resources to invest in infrastructure and rebuild, and it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle,” Schlegelmilch said.“But the opposite can also happen,” he continued. “Then you see chronic medical issues, you see mental health issues, you see underinvestment in infrastructure, and you see these communities that can’t get up to their baseline before the next disaster strikes.”As the territory begins the process of rebuilding, the compromised electrical grid may offer a unique opportunity. Puerto Rico is rich with natural resources to generate wind and solar energy, but those methods only represent 2 percent of the island’s electricity supply right now, McNamara said. “If you can increase those resources and build the [electric] grid in a way that creates micro-grids, then you can have this resiliency,” she said. “You can have people supplying their own power and keeping their lights on.”Schlegelmilch saw evidence of the resiliency of renewable energy sources when he visited areas of Texas affected by Hurricane Harvey earlier this month. “We saw huge windmills that had completely survived. They were fine,” he said. “They were built to withstand this.”“Puerto Rico would have been much better off not being hit by the hurricane,” he continued. “But now that so much of its infrastructure is destroyed and needs to be rebuilt, the question is, is it going to be rebuilt the same, or is it going to be rebuilt even better?” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-power-outage_n_59c3dddfe4b063b253187f00,HuffPost,Liberal
194,Puerto Rico governor: Power could be out for months,"Holly Yan, Steve Almasy and Cassandra Santiago",9/21/17," Puerto Rico's energy grid took such a severe blow from deadly Hurricane Maria that restoring power to everyone may take months, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN on Wednesday night. The entire system is down, the governor said. No one on the island has power from utilities. Puerto Rico, which has been through a long recession and is deeply in debt, has a power grid that is ""a little bit old, mishandled and weak,"" Rosselló told ""Anderson Cooper 360˚."" ""It depends on the damage to the infrastruacture,"" he said. ""I'm afraid it's probably going to be severe. If it is ... we're looking at months as opposed to weeks or days."" The impact of the storm on the island territory won't be realized until officials can do a flyover and see what remains.  Rosselló said officials think some power stations are not badly damaged, but the distribution system is ruined. If transmission lines are in better shape than thought, power outages might be fixed sooner, the governor said.  Rosselló told CNN that at least one person died in the storm when a board was ripped from the house it had been nailed to by the wind and hit a man. The governor said the number of casualties in some areas is unknown because it is hard to communicate. ""We still don't have a lot of information,"" he said. ""We're virtually disconnected in terms of communications with the southeast part of the island."" The storm -- which restrengthened into a Category 3 hurricane early Thursday -- has ravaged the Caribbean over the past few days, wreaking devastation on Dominica and the Virgin Islands before slamming into Puerto Rico.  And the threat is not yet over. A hurricane warning is in effect for the Turks and Caicos, the southeastern Bahamas and parts of the Dominican Republic. Dominica: 15 dead; looting and food, water shortages The island of Dominica took the full force of Maria before the storm passed on to the US territory. At least 15 people died there.  Government spokesman Charles Jong said that Maria was the ""most horrifying experience"" he has faced, despite seeing out many other hurricanes. He said he is out of power, food and water, and that people in Dominica have ""gone into survival mode."" He added that there is widespread looting on the island. The devastation on Dominica is immense , a CNN crew flying over the island reported. Hundreds of homes have been visibly flattened or damaged. Many had roofs torn off.  The landscape has been stripped bare. Thousands of trees have been snapped at their base and those still standing are devoid of leaves. Dominica was a lush green landscape, including rainforests, but now is brown and lifeless.  Storm has moved toward the Dominican Republic Now that Maria has moved past Puerto Rico, a US territory with 3.3 million people, search and rescue teams are taking to the country's darkened streets. The devastating winds had died down to a whisper late Wednesday and the flooding rains were just a drizzle, but getting around was difficult due to widespread damage and no electricity except from generators. The storm caused widespread flooding and ripped trees out of the ground. More than 10,000 remained in shelters Wednesday night.  ""This is total devastation,"" said Carlos Mercader, a spokesman for Puerto Rico's governor. ""Puerto Rico, in terms of the infrastructure, will not be the same. ... This is something of historic proportions.""  A nightly curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. will take effect Wednesday evening and end Saturday morning, Puerto Rico Gov.  announced. Maria is next expected to pass by the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos Islands, causing dangerous storm surge and rainfall. People in eastern parts of the Dominican were seeing whipping winds Wednesday night. The once-major hurricane has already killed seven people on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica, said Gaston Browne, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda.  Browne said he had been communicating with the Prime Minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, who reported  ""widespread devastation"" and whose own house was shredded by the storm . Puerto Rican Olympic gymnast Tommy Ramos, who rode out the storm in the northern city of Vega Baja, posted video of gusts blowing debris in front of him.  ""The house is steady,"" Ramos told CNN. ""What scares us is the flooding."" Astriv Velez, who survived the storm inside a walk-in closet, said water was coming in through the walls of her home in Trujillo Alto, just outside San Juan. ""The wind and rain has not stopped,"" Velez said. ""There are no trees, there is no green -- only brown."" TRACK THE STORM Devastation in St. Croix and St. Thomas Maria obliterated buildings on several other Caribbean islands. Aaliyah Bisamber of St. Croix shot video of Maria's annihilation of her old house, which was right next to her new home.  ""I was pretty amazed the hurricane had such power to rip off half the house,"" she told CNN.  Murillo Melo recently moved to St. Croix from Brazil -- only to face one of the island's most catastrophic hurricanes.  ""It was really scary. The floors were shaking, the walls, everything was moving and shaking,"" he said.  ""Here on the island and on the mainland people are trying to get in contact with friends and relatives. ... People are desperate to get some news from their friends and relatives."" US Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft said the damage to St. Croix is especially alarming.  ""First priority is going to be saving of lives -- not just in Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands -- I'm especially concerned with St. Croix, that was also in the path of Hurricane Maria when it was a Category 5 hurricane,"" Zukunft said Wednesday.  On the US Virgin Island of St. Thomas, retired New York police detective Austin Fields surveyed the damage to his residence.  ""My home is no longer a home,"" he said.  Virgin Islands and Dominican Republic under the gun Maria's wrath is far from over.  Dangerous storm surges ""accompanied by large and destructive waves"" will raise water levels 10 to 15 feet above normal tide levels in the hurricane warning areas of the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos, the hurricane center said. The islands could also see as much as 20 inches of rain. Some long-range models say Maria could move toward the North Carolina coast as it moves north. CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater said people should keep an eye on the storm.  Puerto Rico: 11 years in recession and now no electricity Radars knocked out Maria became the  first hurricane of Category 4 strength  or higher in 85 years to make a direct landfall on Puerto Rico.  The hurricane slammed the US territory with such intensity, it broke two National Weather Service radars there.  Are you affected by Hurricane Maria?

197,Puerto Rico governor: Still time to get to shelters before Hurricane Maria,"Holly Yan, Steve Almasy and Euan McKirdy ",9/20/17," There is still time for Puerto Ricans to get to a government-run shelter before powerful Hurricane Maria clobbers the island, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CNN late Tuesday. But the window of opportunity is closing.  ""There's still time ... but people need to move fast,"" Ricardo Rosselló told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360˚,"" calling the storm the ""worst hurricane in modern history in Puerto Rico."" US President Trump tweeted his thoughts to those on the island, a US territory. ""Be careful, our hearts are with you,"" he wrote, calling the storm a ""monster hurricane,"" and pledging assistance. Maria is a Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 175 mph (281 kph). By late Tuesday, the eye of hurricane was expected to move near or over St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands and make landfall in Puerto Rico Wednesday morning.  ""Winds are starting to pick up, the glass is starting to bow back and forth. We're soon going to take shelter in a safe room,"" Mike Theiss, a hurricane chaser who is staying in Fajardo, told CNN's Don Lemon. Maria has already obliterated parts of Dominica and killed at least one person in Guadeloupe. Rosselló said there are about 500 shelters open. Emergency workers are still out, but will head in when sustained winds reach 50 mph, the governor said. Many people live on the eastern half of Puerto Rico, which forecasters worry will endure the brunt of the most powerful hurricane ever to hit the island.  Residents of Puerto Rico, who were spared some of Irma's wrath when that hurricane's core passed north of the island, boarded up homes and businesses Tuesday. People who fled to the US territory as Maria, and before it, Hurricane Irma, which swept through the region just days ago, advanced on their islands sought refuge in hotels and shelters.  Fraught journey Jessica Mangiaracina and Bob Perkins came to San Juan from St. Thomas with their two children. Irma destroyed everything around them and threw the island into chaos. It took them six days to get off St. Thomas, they said, killing chickens for food and making their way through areas being looted.  They got to Puerto Rico by catamaran, where, like many others, they tried to get a flight out with no success. Now they are coping with the reality that they've escaped into the middle of Hurricane Maria's angry path.  The couple is among thousands of people in shelters.  When asked what their current plan is, Perkins responded, ""survive.""  Heather Farrell, a visitor to the island, is on her honeymoon with her husband Luke. They were married on September 9. She says  that they had tried to cut their trip short when it became apparent that they were in Maria's firing line.  ""We did try to get off, as early as Saturday but all flights were either booked or canceled. We actually are on the ocean -- our room faces the ocean. It's pretty windy but there is no rain. We'll stay inside for now.""  She said that hotel staff had asked that all guests that are staying at the hotel come downstairs early Wednesday morning to a safe room that they have set up for them.  ""I would rather be home than here but I guess we're making the best of it,"" she said.  Worst storm in almost 80 years Millions of Puerto Ricans are hoping to survive what could be the most powerful storm to ever hit the island. Maria likely will be the first Category 4 or 5 hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico in more than eight decades.  ""No generation has seen a hurricane like this since San Felipe II in 1928,"" Rosselló said earlier. ""This is an unprecedented atmospheric system.""  President Donald Trump said the federal government will aid Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm. ""Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane,"" the President tweeted. ""Be careful, our hearts are with you -- will be there to help!"" Maria has already killed one man in Guadeloupe after he ignored orders to stay inside and was struck by a falling tree, the island's government said.  Track the storm Man killed by falling tree in Guadeloupe Two other people are missing after a boat sank off the coast of La Désirade, a smaller island near the mainland of Guadeloupe. The government said about 80,000 people, or 40% of the households on the island, are without power.  The storm also caused ""widespread devastation"" in Dominica, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said Tuesday.  The hurricane shredded the prime minister's house overnight and left much of the island -- population 73,000 -- in ruins. Overseas, relatives were trying to reestablish contact with loved ones on the island.  Petrona Joseph, a public relations consultant who lives in Montreal, told CNN that her sister in Dominica was at home in Roseau, huddling in the bathroom with the rest of the family when they lost their roof. They thought about trying to go to a neighbor's home but the winds were too strong. Joseph last heard from her sister by text Monday night around 11 p.m. Maria is now the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in Dominica, a former French and British colony whose economy relies heavily on tourism and agriculture.  Puerto Rico says Maria 'will be catastrophic' Maria could bring up to 2 feet of rain and a storm surge of up to 9 feet to Puerto Rico, sparking flooding and mudslides, CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. In the capital city of San Juan, residents cleared store shelves of water and other supplies. A CNN producer who was driving from the airport Tuesday said there were still some vehicles on the road. Of the two gas stations she passed, one was open. Many shops were already closed, she observed. Some tourists from California told her that the hostel they are staying at moved them to an interior room when the men were unable to find flights home.  Gov. Rosselló has declared a state of emergency, and Trump has   issued an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico to aid with federal assistance.  Puerto Rico sheltered many of the evacuees who fled from other Caribbean Islands during Hurricane Irma earlier this month. Now those evacuees and native Puerto Ricans are bracing for devastation.  ""This is an event that will be damaging to the infrastructure, that will be catastrophic,"" Rosselló said. ""Our only focus right now should be to make sure we save lives."" ""We expect to feel storm winds, tropical storm winds, (from) Tuesday up until late on Thursday. That's about two-and-a-half days of tropical storm winds,"" Rosselló said.  The Puerto Rico Convention Center in the capital San Juan to the north -- which is still housing Hurricane Irma evacuees from other Caribbean islands -- is preparing to accept thousands of residents as the worst of the storm is felt.  Martinique largely spared  One bit of good news emerged from the Caribbean: The French island of Martinique suffered no major damage, the French Interior Ministry tweeted Tuesday.  Maria knocked out power to about 50,000 homes, and 10,000 homes had no water. But overall, the damage assessment was ""reassuring,"" the French Interior Ministry said.  The director general of French civil security, Jacques Witkowski, said only two people on Martinique suffered minor injuries.  Rapid intensification In just 30 hours, Maria's intensity exploded from 65 mph on Sunday to 160 mph by Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said. The British Foreign Office said more than 1,300 troops are on standby, either on affected islands or in nearby locations, ready to help after Maria tears through. One military team has been deployed to the British Virgin Islands, and a British military reconnaissance team is on standby to go to the British territory of Montserrat.   The HMS Ocean is set to arrive in the area at week's end with 60 tons of government supplies.

196,Puerto Rico had half as many people the last time it saw a hurricane this bad,Cassandra Santiago,9/20/17," Hurricane Maria became the strongest storm to make landfall in Puerto Rico in 85 years  when it barreled ashore Wednesday morning  as a Category 4.  In 1932, the San Ciprián hurricane made landfall in late September, pummeling the island for eight long hours.  At the time, the population of Puerto Rico was a little more than 1.5 million people. Today, more than 3.3 million people call the US territory home. San Ciprián, with winds of 145 mph, ripped across the entire island from east to west. More than 3,000 people suffered injuries and 225 died.  Another 250,000 had no homes to go back to.  Structural damages totaled more than $1.5 million,  according to records  kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amounts to $27.5 million today. Maria arrived near Yabucoa, whipping the island with winds of 155 mph, just 2 mph shy of Category 5 strength. It came barely two weeks after Hurricane Irma destroyed buildings and caused widespread power loss. President Trump and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló issued emergency declarations ahead of Maria's arrival.  In the hours before the storm made landfall, more than 10,000 Puerto Ricans heeded calls to take refuge in shelters. Emergency workers, Rosselló had warned, wouldn't be around to help once winds reached 50 mph.  ""This is an unprecedented atmospheric system,"" he  said Tuesday. And it's one that Puerto Rico hopes doesn't leave it in ruins like San Ciprián did.",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/19/us/maria-puerto-rico-85-years-trnd/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjo_6Sg7cj6AhU2ZjABHUdAAvQ4jgIQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw0ZuWrQieU79PJwAtcn4qYW,CNN,Liberal
195,Puerto Rico: 11 years in recession and now no electricity,Patrick Gillespie,9/20/17,"Puerto Rico is already in an 11-year economic recession. Now it must start rebuilding after Hurricane Maria left the island knocked out flat.  The island was completely without electricity Wednesday.    
 
  ""This is total devastation,"" said Carlos Mercader, a spokesman for Puerto Rico's governor. ""Puerto Rico, in terms of the infrastructure, will not be the same.""   The total extent of the damage isn't known yet, but the visuals are telling: Roofs blown off, flooded streets, shattered windows, debris and remnants of palm trees strewn about. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the island since 1932.   Estimates of the financial toll are likely to start coming in over coming days. But the price tag will be large.    The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Congress and private insurance firms will take on the lion's share of that cost. But Puerto Rico's cash-strapped local government will have to take on some costs, too.   ""We don't know what the aftermath of the hurricanes will be, but there will clearly be federal help to rebuild the infrastructure of both the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico,"" says John Mousseau, an expert on Puerto Rican debt at Cumberland Advisors, a firm based in Florida.       Puerto Rico is already suffering through an epic economic crisis. There's no way it could foot the entire bill itself. In May, it filed for  the largest municipal bankruptcy  in U.S. history.   The government owes $74 billion to bondholders and it hasn't made a payment in over a year. It is trying to work out a payment schedule with an oversight board installed by Congress. This past summer, the island's government and the oversight board bickered over what the board called a lack of progress in a debt payment plan.   The island suffers from severely high unemployment -- more than 10% -- and an exodus of residents who have fled to the mainland U.S. for better job opportunities. Over 400,000 residents have left the island since 2004 -- 89,000 last year alone, according to the Pew Research Center. The current population is about 3.4 million.   There is a ray of hope in the gloom. Some experts say Maria's aftermath is an opportunity for Puerto Rico to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure that desperately needed a makeover.   Plus, the recovery and reconstruction efforts could create much-needed jobs on the island.   ""It's almost like wiping the slate clean,"" says Cate Long, founder of the Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, an independent research firm focused on the island's debts. ""All the rebuilding will boost the economy.""

198,"Puerto Ricans stock up, brace for Irma","Leyla Santiago, Jason Hanna and Darran Simon",9/6/17," People rushed to stores in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, emptying shelves of food and water as worry set in ahead of  Hurricane Irma 's expected impact Wednesday on the US territory.  Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in preparation. Those living on the commonwealth braced for the hurricane's potentially devastating winds and deluge, fearing if the Category 5 storm knocks out power from the bankrupt island's weakened electrical system, it may take weeks or months before power is restored.  Irma could be the strongest hurricane to ever hit the island, forecasters say. Some wonder whether Puerto Rico can rebuild.  ""This is not a hurricane, this is a beast,"" a clerk in San Juan told CNN.  Another woman told  CNN affiliate WAPA  the power ""is something absolutely necessary, especially due to Puerto Rico's weather. We need to have the A/C or a fan on all night."" Last month, the director of Puerto Rico's power utility, Ricardo Ramos Rodríguez, said several factors have made the island's electric system ""vulnerable and fragile,"" WAPA reported. One of those is the shortage of employees. Many workers recently retired or left their jobs for better prospects on the US mainland, Ramos Rodríguez said. Gov: Irma's magnitude 'never seen before' Late Tuesday, Hurricane Irma was churning toward the northeastern Caribbean at 185 miles an hour.  The forecast had it hitting around Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla by late Tuesday or early Wednesday, before impacting the British and US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later that afternoon.  The storm's path is uncertain but Florida was also bracing for Irma's impact, possibly this weekend.  ""The magnitude of this storm ... has never been seen before in Puerto Rico,"" Rosselló said, WAPA reported. ""Although we hope that this hurricane will not greatly impact Puerto Rico, we are bracing for what could be a very catastrophic event."" Track the storm here Alejandro De La Campa, director, FEMA's Caribbean Area Division, said the strongest hurricane to hit the island was a 160 mph storm in 1928.  ""We haven't faced a threat like this in many, many years,"" he said, WAPA reported.  In a letter to President Donald Trump, Rosselló asked for federal assistance before the storm hit. The governor also asked the President to declare a state of emergency.  Rosselló wrote ""the required assistance is crucial to lessen its impact on the island.""  Government officials have identified more than 450 shelters across the island for citizens in flood-prone areas, the governor wrote. 'We're used to earthquakes' In San Juan, people stood in long lines Tuesday afternoon at a Sam's Club, stocking up on water and gas canisters.  Joanna Martinez, who was in one of  lines, said she finally found a store that still had water after trying a few stores.  Martinez, who has an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old, said she was worried about Irma's impact. On another line, Yolie and Ron Goodman also wondered what devastation the storm would bring. ""We've never been through anything like this. We're used to earthquakes,"" said Yolie Goodman, who moved from Hermosa Beach, California, to Playa de Naguabo with her husband, Ron.  The retirees already had shored up their home by putting up storm covers. Public schools and officials at the University of Puerto Rico campuses have canceled classes, and many businesses are closed. ""Make a U-turn and die in the ocean, Irma. The Caribbean islands don't need more problems!"" Twitter user mujertropical wrote about the storm. Puerto Rico's financial crisis READ: Hurricane Irma isn't what Puerto Rico needs right now Puerto Rico could see natural devastation as it struggles with its own economic disaster. The country's economy has declined over the years because of government overspending, a heavy dependence on debt and a costly, inefficient energy system. In May, the financial crises led the commonwealth to file the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history.  The US territory has $74 million in debt and another $50 million in pension obligations on the books. Rosselló said the commonwealth has money ready in case of an emergency, despite the economic conditions. There is $15 million for an emergency fund set aside in the island's budget, officials said.

115,"Puerto Rico May Dodge The Worst Of Hurricane Irma, But Challenges Remain",Hayley Miller,9/5/17,"Days after Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in southern Texas, a monster storm is barreling toward the northern Caribbean and southeastern United States. One of the first destinations in Hurricane Irma’s path is Puerto Rico, the cash-strapped U.S. territory deep in the throes of a decade-long economic crisis. Irma is expected to hit the island on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, and all throughout Tuesday residents and tourists alike prepared for the upcoming barrage of wind and water. “This is something without precedent,” Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told a news conference on Tuesday. “We’re expecting that it’s coming at Puerto Rico with force, and we’ve got to be ready for it.”On Tuesday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the island territory, authorizing federal officials to aid with disaster relief efforts there. However, the island’s economic situation has raised concerns over the potential for damage, even if Puerto Rico dodges the worst of the storm. Here’s what’s at stake for the island.The Forecast For Puerto RicoHurricane Irma was upgraded to an “extremely dangerous” Category 5 on Tuesday, with maximum sustained winds reaching 185 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. But experts say Puerto Rico may escape some of the storm’s most devastating effects.“It’s going to be a very, very close call,” said Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado-based meteorologist. Klotzbach explained that the hurricane is currently on track to pass north of the island. “Puerto likely won’t feel the full wrath of Irma ... Hopefully, the storm does not go south,” Klotzbach said. Mark Jury, professor of meteorology at the University of Puerto Rico, echoed that analysis. “I don’t worry much ― the track forecasts have settled on a northward route, missing Puerto Rico,” he said. Jury did note that the island can expect heavy rainfall during and after the storm’s passage, which may bring its own set of challenges. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at Weather Underground, said that while the impact of the storm would be significant, the island is not expected to be hit directly and that winds would reach around Category 1 hurricane strength. “I call it a modest hurricane for them,” Masters noted. How The Island Is PreparingOn Monday, Rosselló declared a state of emergency and activated the national guard. The island has 456 shelters available to house people displaced by the storm. Those shelters can accommodate up to 63,229 people. Individuals living in likely-to-flood areas were urged to identify their nearest shelter.As in parts of Florida, Puerto Rico will evacuate flood-prone regions in the island’s north and east. Rosselló also announced that the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources of Puerto Rico is working with 14 pumping stations in order to prevent flooding. The government has also readied 200 trucks equipped with 6,000 gallons of water.The Federal Emergency Management Agency, meanwhile, has dispatched more than 500 officials across the island, and has provided medical and search-and-rescue teams.Debt ComplicationsWhile the worst of Irma appears likely to bypass the island, the storm could still cause major problems for the debt-ridden territory. Puerto Rico has more than $74 billion in debt and an additional $50 billion in pension liabilities — roughly $34,000 in debt per resident. Those debts ballooned over more than a decade of recession, during which the island saw unemployment skyrocket and a massive exodus as Puerto Ricans left the island to resettle in the mainland U.S. at historic rates. (Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship.) After a year of defaulting on its loan payments, Puerto Rico declared bankruptcy in May, the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.“Puerto Rico can no longer fully pay its debt and pay for government services,” read the filing by the oversight board appointed last year to steer the territory back to financial stability. “In short, Puerto Rico’s crisis has reached a breaking point.”That leaves Puerto Rico in a precarious situation to face the potentially massive damage a major storm can cause.Of most immediate concern is the island’s already troubled power supply. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, has accrued roughly $9 billion in debt over the last few years. Customers, meanwhile, have seen their power bills go up even as their service declined. On Tuesday, PREPA’s director warned that some areas of the island could go without power for four to six months due to storm damage. Irma could also prompt even more Puerto Ricans to leave the island, exacerbating the economic woes there. Puerto Rico’s government says it has set aside $15 million in an emergency fund. And Trump’s disaster declaration makes federal aid available to the territory for emergency protective measures as well as debris removal.According to CNN, FEMA is working with Congress to bolster its relief funding so the agency has adequate resources to assist the island’s recovery efforts. However, it’s unclear how Puerto Rico would afford recovery costs if they exceed the emergency fund and what the federal government can provide.

200,Hurricane Irma isn't what Puerto Rico needs right now,Jill Disis,9/5/17,"Puerto Rico is in the path of a powerful new hurricane, and it couldn't come at a worse time for the broke U.S. territory.  Hurricane Irma -- now a Category 5 storm with 185 mph winds -- could slam into Puerto Rico by mid-Wednesday as it rips through the northeastern Caribbean,  according to forecasts.      The island has been bracing for impact for the past several days and Gov. Ricardo Rosselló  declared a state of emergency  Monday.   But the threat of a natural disaster comes as the territory deals with a massive economic one.   Puerto Rico  has been watching its economy decline for years  because of enormous government overspending, a big dependence on debt and a costly, inefficient energy system.    Those problems finally led the commonwealth in May  to file  the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Puerto Rico has $74 billion in debt, and another $50 billion in pension obligations on the books.    The island claims it has money ready in case of emergency. Rosselló said Monday that despite its economic challenges, Puerto Rico's budget contains an approved $15 million available as an emergency fund,  according to a news release .   Puerto Rican officials did not respond to questions from CNNMoney about its disaster funding.   And the cost of recovery will likely come with significant federal help. The Federal Emergency Management Agency already has about 400 people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to help with hurricane preparation and response, said John Rabin, FEMA's acting regional administrator there.   ""Right now, the concept of cost has not come up with Puerto Rico,"" Rabin said. He said a disaster declaration, which would open the door for federal aid, could come days or even weeks after Irma blows though the region.   Rabin added that FEMA is working with Congress to put more money in its Disaster Relief Fund so that the agency has the funds necessary to help.   Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's who covers Puerto Rican bonds, said he has no reason to doubt that aid will come.   ""I don't think that the commonwealth's well-known economic and fiscal struggles would undermine its ability to secure the aid that it deserves in the aftermath of a major storm,"" he said.    But a powerful hurricane like Irma could still harm Puerto Rico in other ways. Hampton said that a severe disaster could exacerbate some of the commonwealth's adverse economic trends, including migration to the U.S. mainland.   The island's population  has dropped 10% since 2007 , in part because of a lack of jobs. Many professionals have been fleeing to the U.S.   ""Puerto Rico is struggling, and it's possible that this storm will add to its economic difficulties,"" Hampton said. ""It could leave a lingering economic mark, even with the availability of federal relief funds.""   The loss of workers could potentially contribute to other problems as Irma approaches. Residents told  CNN affiliate WAPA  that they were worried the storm might knock the power out for weeks or months.   The director of Puerto Rico's power utility, Ricardo Ramos Rodríguez, recently said that several factors have made the island's electric system ""vulnerable and fragile,"" WAPA reported.   Among those issues: an employee shortage. Rodríguez said that many workers recently retired or left their jobs for better prospects on the U.S. mainland.    -- CNN's Nicole Chavez and Jason Hanna contributed to this story.

199,Hurricane Irma strengthens; Florida and Puerto Rico prepare,"Susannah Cullinane, Holly Yan and Joe Sutton",9/5/17," Hurricane Irma strengthened to a Category 4 storm Monday, churning west in the Atlantic Ocean and prompting emergency declarations in Florida and Puerto Rico. Although Irma's path remains uncertain, the possibility it could threaten the United States led Florida Gov. Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency in all 67 counties in his state.  ""In Florida, we always prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and while the exact path of Irma is not absolutely known at this time, we cannot afford to not be prepared,"" Scott said in a statement released late Monday afternoon. ""This state of emergency allows our emergency management officials to act swiftly in the best interest of Floridians without the burden of bureaucracy or red tape."" Scott said on Twitter he spoke to President Donald Trump Monday night. He said Trump ""offered the full resources of the federal government as Floridians prepare for Hurricane Irma."" The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rosselló, declared a state of emergency Monday and activated the National Guard. Hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued an hurricane warning for Puerto Rico. Classes will not be held on Tuesday in the public education system nor in the University of Puerto Rico, according to a release from the governor's office. Rosselló warned the public on Sunday that the island could feel Irma's wrath around noon Wednesday.  As of 11 p.m. ET, Monday, Irma was about 410 miles (660 kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands, the National Hurricane Center said. It is packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph) as it heads west at 13 mph (20 kph). Landfall is expected early Wednesday on the island of Anguilla.  Computer models show the system moving through the Caribbean, and by the end of week, it will turn right toward the north, said CNN meteorologist and weather anchor Tom Sater.  ""There is a small window. If it turns sooner rather than later, we could maybe see the system slide by the East Coast into the ocean, but that window is shutting quickly,"" Sater said. ""It definitely looks like we will be impacted by a major hurricane that is a Category 3, 4 or 5."" TRACK THE STORM HERE The hurricane center said swells generated by Irma would begin impacting the northern Leeward Islands on Monday.  ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" the hurricane center said.  In addition to Puerto Rico, a string of Caribbean islands are now under hurricane warnings, including Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Martin/Sint Maarten and St. Barts, the hurricane center said.  ""A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area,"" the hurricane center said. ""A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion."" And Irma will only strengthen this week, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""Over the coming days, it's going to get into that warmer water. That's going to help the storm intensify.""   Puerto Ricans warned Irma is expected to remain a ""dangerous major hurricane"" through the week and could directly affect the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas, the agency said.  Puerto Rico's disaster management agency, AEMEAD, is monitoring Irma and has opened an information hotline. Florida governor says be prepared It's too soon to know the impact Irma could have on the continental United States, where no warnings or watches are in effect. ""Regardless, everyone in hurricane-prone areas should ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place, as we are now near the peak of the season,"" the hurricane center said. Chinchar said Irma could affect not just the eastern coast of Florida, but also farther up the East Coast.  ""If there was a US landfall, we're talking a week from today,"" Chinchar said Monday.  Gov. Scott urged the state's residents to ensure their disaster supply kits were ready. ""Disaster preparedness should be a priority for every Florida family,"" he tweeted Sunday Read: Hurricane Irma could be next weather disaster Why Irma could be especially intense Irma is a classic "" Cape Verde hurricane ,"" meaning it formed in the far eastern Atlantic, near the Cape Verde Islands (now known as the Cabo Verde Islands), before tracking all the way across the Atlantic, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.  And Cape Verde storms frequently become some of the largest and most intense hurricanes. Examples include  Hurricane Hugo, Hurricane Floyd, and Hurricane Ivan .

116,What to do In Puerto Rico - The Local Secrets,"Global Yodel, Contributor",8/29/17,"At Global Yodel, we love learning about place from a local perspective. We sent Yodelers Fernando Samalot and Bárbara Cruz to the amazing El San Juan Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton to shoot some photos and create a Puerto Rico Travel Guide full of unique island-life tips and amazing local secrets, just for you. Name: Fernando Samalot & Bárbara Cruz Occupation: Visual Artists/Content CreatorsPlace you live: The beautiful mountain town of Adjuntas, Puerto RicoCan you sum up San Juan, Puerto Rico in a paragraph? Puerto Rico is a small Caribbean archipelago consisting of one main island and a few smaller islands. The main island is a little over 100 miles across but it makes up for its small size by having an immeasurably rich culture, history, cuisine and some of the most beautiful natural wonders found anywhere in the world. San Juan is Puerto Rico’s capital, located on the north coast of the metropolitan area of the island and it receives hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Although most tend to stay in San Juan, it’s in venturing around the island where you can get a real scope of the beauty of Puerto Rico. Here’s another moment when our relatively small size is beneficial; everything is close by!What is the best thing about San Juan, Puerto Rico? San Juan tends to be the first city travelers will visit in Puerto Rico. Its accessibility from the main airport SJU makes it an ideal first stop to get better acquainted with the island. Old San Juan, in particular, is one of our most picturesque cities, known for its colorful colonial buildings and cobblestone streets. On sunny days, of which we have a lot, you can enjoy some of our beautiful beaches in Ocean Park, visit one of our many art museums in Santurce and taste the huge variety of rich cuisine we have to offer. Whatever vibe you’re into, you can definitely find something to enjoy in the city.What are the people like in Puerto Rico? Puerto Ricans are a warm, humble and lively people. Passionate, to say the least, we feel very proud of our island, culture, and heritage and most of us enjoy sharing that with travelers. Spend one night out with locals and you’ll learn more about the real Puerto Rico than any travel guide could ever tell you.What is a perfect day in San Juan, Puerto Rico? Since we’re inclined towards nature, our perfect day will definitely include a beach or a river or both. Being in such an accessible location, the beach, and the rainforest are very close by so visiting both in a day is very possible.Start your day with a beautiful breakfast at Caña, where Chef Juliana Gonzalez does an impeccable job of taking our local cuisine and fusing it with international flavors.El Yunque Rainforest is less than an hour’s drive from San Juan and it has infinite wonders to discover. You can take one of the many hiking trails through the rainforest and immerse yourself in its own unique environment. Home to many waterfalls and swimming holes, you could spend a whole week exploring and still find new ones. It is, however, recommended that you go with either a tour guide or a local who knows the area.From there I would definitely recommend checking out a beach in Piñones, Loiza, which is just 15 minutes away from San Juan. The first beach tends to be generally overcrowded but the farther you go down the road, the more desolate and beautiful the beaches become. Our favorite is Vacía Talega, which is the last one on the coast and hides one of our favorite spots. Alternatively, if you are looking for a more easily accessible beach, you can enjoy the beautiful Isla Verde beach right in front of the El San Juan Hotel.After spending some time taking in the rainforest and soaking up some sun at the beach of your choice, you can grab dinner at one of the many different restaurants in Calle Loiza, which, in recent years, has seen a boom in culinary offerings. One of our favorites is the vegetarian restaurant, Cocobana where everything is delicious.Our favorite way to end the day in San Juan is catching the sunset in El Morro, the old fort in Old San Juan. On a clear day, you can see the sun dip into the ocean from the high walls of the fort and the sky paint up in the wildest colors you’ve ever seen.See more amazing travel guides with local insight at GlobalYodel.com.

117,Setting Priorities Straight: Time to Audit Puerto Rico's Debt,"Fellowship Program @YPFP, Contributor",8/5/17,"By Jeanette BonifazArriving in Puerto Rico, sounds of the famous “Nuyorican” salsa musician Willie Colon’s music blasted through the airport speakers in stores and restaurants. The first impression of jubilance and glow in the atmosphere, however, contradicted the dire situation that 3.5 million Puerto Ricans currently find themselves in. The Caribbean island owes $74 billion to bondholders and $50 billion to pension systems, has 45.5 percent of its population living in poverty, and retains an unfair political status that fuels grievances. Additionally, in complete defiance to the values of democracy and accountability, an unelected Fiscal Control Board appointed by the United States Congress under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) now has de facto authority over Puerto Rico’s finances. Instead of focusing energy and resources on finding a realistic way out of the crisis, the current administration led by Governor Ricardo Rosselló and his New Progressive Party decided to push for a plebiscite to vote on the status of the island and campaigned tirelessly to promote statehood. After five previous plebiscites proving that obtaining statehood was extremely unlikely, the non-binding plebiscite held on June 11, 2017, served only to give illusory hopes to those holding on to the belief that Puerto Rico’s ills could be remedied by becoming the 51st state. Even if achieved, however, statehood would not act as a magic wand to remedy the island’s problems. A more astute course of action would be to focus on pushing for an independent audit of Puerto Rico’s debt in order to transparently and morally restructure it.The impending crisis has not only revived debate concerning the island’s status, but on the issues of corruption and inequality as well. Puerto Rico’s median household income is $18,626, compared to $56,515 on the mainland United States, and the average unemployment rate from 2010 to 2016 was 14 percent. The economic and social situation in Puerto Rico is so dire that many residents are leaving the island. According to the Institute of Statistics, 89,000 people emigrated in 2015. The perspectives of Puerto Ricans are plastered throughout street walls all over the island. Feelings of distrust and anger towards the Board are reflected in works of graffiti that read “Promesa es Pobreza” (PROMESA is Poverty) and “No a la Junta” (No to the Board). Many people in the streets, buses, restaurants, and parks are eager to discuss the economic crisis, the debt, and the future, adamantly expressing their rejection of the Board and the austerity measures it promotes.Most people underscore the importance of auditing the debt as a first step towards transparency and accountability. As one Puerto Rican, an Uber driver named Elisa, put it, “even if spending cuts are in place and even if the unelected board implements all the austerity measures possible, we would still not have enough to pay the debt. There is a real chance that an audit would reduce the debt to a much more manageable amount.” Nevertheless, Governor Rosselló signed a law eliminating the commission charged with auditing the debt (The Puerto Rico Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of the Public Credit), claiming any issue regarding the illegality of the debt should be treated in court, not in a commission. He also stated that spending 2 million dollars in the commission was “incompatible” with his administration. While he did not want to spend money on the commission, he was quick to release about 8 million dollars for the plebiscite. This does not come as a surprise as many politicians and people from the private sector could be implicated if illegality is confirmed. Fortunately, a group of concerned citizens and former members of the commission have taken over the job of promoting transparency and accountability of the public debt, a task previously delegated by law to the commission. The group, called The Citizen Front for the Audit of the Debt, works tirelessly as a non-profit organization to demand and oversee an audit.There are several reasons why auditing the debt is the best course of action. First, it has been proven successful elsewhere. In 2014, France’s Committee for a Citizen's Audit on the Public Debt found that 60 percent of the public debt was illegitimate. Similar audits have success in Spain, Ecuador, and Greece. Second, the people who are paying the debt via cuts to education and healthcare deserve to know what they are paying for. Third, an audit, by definition, would show exactly how the debt was incurred, for what, and whom it benefited. Finally, the now defunct commission found probable cause in a 2016 preliminary report that some of Puerto Rico’s debt could in fact have been fraudulent and recommended continued investigation. Neither PROMESA nor statehood will solve Puerto Rico’s economic and social crisis. While PROMESA made it possible to protect Puerto Rico from lawsuits and to initiate a process similar to bankruptcy procedures, most of the weight is falling on the shoulders of ordinary citizens like Elisa. The bill practically and symbolically corroborated the colonialist relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico, especially through the establishment of the undemocratic and authoritarian Fiscal Control Board. Cuts to healthcare, education, and public spending in general, at the Board’s request, are only going to make matters worse. Without a debt audit and a restructuring plan that brings the debt to sustainable levels, PROMESA will indeed just lead to more pobreza.

118,'Despacito' Is Making Everyone Want To Visit Puerto Rico,Suzy Strutner,7/21/17,"It appears that themost streamed song of all time is drumming up interest in theprettiest island of all time. The Spanish-language song “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee was an instant hit, but the jam really took off stateside when anEnglish-infused remix featuring Justin Bieber debuted on April 17. Both tracks feature lines aboutPuerto Rico. (In the English version, it’s “This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico.”)Hotels.com reported that in the two months after the remix came out,searches for travel to Puerto Rico jumped a whopping 45 percent compared to the same time frame last year.Other sites report similar effects: Puerto Rico page views on TripAdvisor were up 24 percent between April 17 and June 17 this year, aTripAdvisor spokeswoman told HuffPost. Over atExpedia, that number was 10 percent. Around this time last year, Puerto Rico was facing a Zika epidemic, which hit its peak in August. Things have improved since then ― officials declared the crisis over in June ― which could also be a reason for more searches this spring.But is it possible the song contributed, too?Kayak says yes: Flight searches increased 25 percent in the two months after the “Despacito” remix debuted, but there has only been a 3.6 percent bump in searches for travel to Puerto Rico during 2017 overall. Something ― summer travel yearnings, Bieber or otherwise ― caused the springtime boost.“It looks like interest really spiked after the release of the remixed song came out in April,” a Kayak spokeswoman told HuffPost. Over at Hopper, flight searches increased 58 percent in the month following the song’s release, compared to a 33 percent interest increase this year overall.So, “the song [realistically] increased flight search demand by 25 percent,” a spokeswoman for Hopper said.Interest in Puerto Rico was waning slightly even before Zika hit: Kayak says searches fell three percent between 2015 and 2016. That means its recent popularity could very well have nothing to do with disease, and everything to do with the remix.Beyond Bieber, American travelers have long chosen Puerto Rico for its proximity to the East Coast and because they don’t need to bring a passport, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico Tourism told HuffPost. She said that other travel-booking sites like Orbitz and Travelocity reported greater interest since the song was released as well.However, “interest” doesn’t necessarily translate into visits: Hotel occupancy rates haven’t budged, according to the Washington Post’s analysis of data from February through May of this year.“We are still looking into how the increase in searches and interest correlates to number of visits and sales,” the tourism spokeswoman said. “We all know that ‘Despacito’ has been more than just a catchy summer tune and has nodded to the talented artists hailing from Puerto Rico. There has been heightened interest in Puerto Rico.”Now if only we could get the song out of our heads...",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/despacito-puerto-rico_n_59710ccee4b09e5f6cce3697,HuffPost,Liberal
119,18 Things You May Not Know About Puerto Rico,Carly Ledbetter,6/15/17,"On Sunday, June 11, Puerto Ricans votedoverwhelmingly in favor of becoming the United States’ 51st state. Puerto Rico is known forits beautiful beaches, but it also has some perks you might not know about. Here are a few reasons to visit our friends in the Caribbean this summer:1. You can leave your passport at home.Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, which means you canditch the passport. But definitely bring a valid ID.2. Thedrinking age is 18.  Your college-aged son or daughter would love it if the next family vacation were in PR.3. The currency is the U.S. Dollar.Which only makes it easier to purchase sunscreen and fun touristy trinkets for the family and friends you left stateside.4. It’s basically 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit all year round.Which means it’s always the perfect time to visit.  5. There’s a lot of island to explore.Puerto Rico is actually an archipelago, which just means there are more islands to ooh and ahh at during your adventures.6. And it has a “lost coast.”While most of Puerto Rico is inhabited by locals and occasionally overrun with tourists, it has a “wild west coast” that supposedly has some of the best surfing and diving in the Caribbean.7. There are 270 miles of beaches to frolick along.Whether you’re headed to Playa Shacks for snorkling, Ballenas Bay to spot some sea turtles or Punta Las Marías in San Juan, there’s more than enough sand and surf for everyone8. You’ll never run out of rum.There’s no shortage of distilleries or bottles at the bar, so you’ll never have to ask yourself that terrible little question...9. And speaking of rum...If you’re not satisfied just sipping your Don Q, try a chichaíto. Best part? You can get it served as a shot for about $1.10. Eating well won’t break the bank.If you’re on a budget, you can get a pretty great meal for as low as $3 while high-end restaurants will cost you somewhere around $30 and up. Not too shabby!11. But driving could get kind of confusing...You still drive on the right side of the road in PR, but the signs are in Spanish and gas is in liters.12. Buried treasure awaits you. Embrace your inner Blackbeard and venture to Playa Puerto Hermina, where pirate Roberto Cofresi supposedly used to hideout.13. It’s a “spelunker’s playground.”For those interested in skipping the beach (or maybe taking a break from tanning), there are over 200 caves to explore in Rio Camuy Cave Park.14. The streets are paved with blue.Some of the streets have blue cobblestones that give a charming vibe and plenty of photo ops.15. It has some of the best coffee in the world.Try as many cups of Yaucono, Alto Grande, El Lareño, Cafe Rico, or Cafe Crema as you possibly can!16. The beach volleyball is unreal.Volleyball can be a way of life for some in PR, so grab a few friends and give it your best Misty May. One piece of advice? Don’t even TRY to kick the locals off a court!17. “Diving the wall” is encouraged.A coral reef cliff better know as La Pared, or “the wall,” lets divers make friends with manatees as they explore some pretty beautiful crystal clear water.18. There’s a 120-foot waterfall with crystal clear water.Enjoy some stunning scenery on your drive to Chorro de Doña Juana, where waterfall pics are encouraged, but diving is definitely cautioned.

201,Puerto Rico statehood referendum draws big support -- but small turnout,Amy Roberts,6/12/17," Puerto Rico on Sunday overwhelmingly voted for statehood. But Congress, the only body that can approve new states, will ultimately decide whether the status of the US commonwealth changes. Ninety-seven percent of the votes in the nonbinding referendum favored statehood, an increase over the results of a 2012 referendum, official results from the State Electoral Commission show. It was the fifth such vote on statehood. ""Today, we the people of Puerto Rico are sending a strong and clear message to the US Congress ... and to the world ... claiming our equal rights as American citizens, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said in a news release. What do we really know about Puerto Rico? When outsiders think of Puerto Rico, a couple of things probably come to mind: It's a small island in the Caribbean. People mostly speak Spanish there. It's not a US state but has American ties. They were the Sharks in ""West Side Story."" (Wait, maybe they were the Jets?) But there's so much more to know. Some Puerto Ricans are raring to cozy up with America to jump-start a flagging economy; meanwhile, some residents would just as soon maintain the status quo, and others would prefer to break ties altogether. Momentum has been building for the island shaped like a postage stamp to join the union as the 51st state, so it's probably smart to start reading up about America's cousin to the south -- its background, economic status and heritage. Step back in time The  Taíno Indians already called the island home  when Christopher Columbus landed there in 1493, and it was settled around 1508 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León.  It was eventually named Puerto Rico, which means ""rich port"" and became a Spanish colony for about 400 years.  The Spanish mined for gold and established  agricultural plantations with slave labor , but the colony eventually became more valuable as a military outpost. The island came under US control in 1898 after the Spanish-American War.  What's a commonwealth? A 1950 federal law helped clarify the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico , paving the way for a public vote on its new constitution. After it was approved in 1952 by the people of Puerto Rico, President Harry Truman, Congress and the Puerto Rican governor, the island became an official US commonwealth. What's the difference between a commonwealth and a territory? Not too much, except that commonwealths have their own constitutions. Puerto Rican residents have been US citizens since 1917 (thanks to the Jones Act), so they receive many of the same benefits and protections, with just a few differences. For one, they can truthfully say, ""Don't blame me, I didn't vote for them,"" when discussing the US presidency. While voters can participate in primary elections, they can't vote for president in the general election.  In 2016, 75% of Puerto Ricans voted for Marco Rubio in the Republican primary (and nearly 14% for Donald Trump) versus Hillary Clinton's 61% of the Democratic vote.  Puerto Rico has a nonvoting delegate in Washington, called a resident commissioner. Back home, Puerto Rico has its own governor and legislative body.  A definite plus to living on the island and one reason some might prefer things as they are: Puerto Ricans only have to pay federal income taxes on work they've done in the States, and not at home. As a commonwealth, Puerto Rico gets US military protection and receives federal funding from the government for highways and social programs, just not as much as an official state gets.  Citizens pay into Social Security and have access to Medicare and Medicaid, but instead of being eligible for Supplemental Security Income assistance, low-income, elderly and blind or disabled people can get help from a similar program run by the US Department of Health and Human Services.  There could be a lot of changes in federal programs if Puerto Rico joins Team USA  as a state, such as those for student loans, the GI Bill, Pell Grants and assistance programs for families and children.  Statehood, independence or somewhere in between Options on the weekend referendum included remaining a commonwealth, becoming a state, entering ""free association"" or becoming an independent nation. Free association is an official affiliation with the United States where Puerto Rico would still receive military assistance and funding.  Four plebiscites, or popular votes, have been held to decide the commonwealth's status in relation to America.  Three of four times, Puerto Rico residents voted against statehood (in 1967, 1993 and 1998).  In a 2012 referendum the majority of voters for the first time chose statehood, but it didn't go anywhere. (Some argued the results should have been considered a ""no"" since more than one-third of voters left the part about alternative status blank.)  Jorge Benitez, a political scientist at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras, said the only definite takeaway from the 2012 vote results at the time was that the people of Puerto Rico wanted a change in status. "" It isn't clear what change we want, but we want change ,"" he said.   ""I think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need,"" Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said after that vote nearly five years ago. In 2012, 6% of voters opted to cut ties with the United States. ""What people have to understand about the need for independence is that there's a fear that's been instilled on the people in Puerto Rico that if we were independent we couldn't run our own country,"" activist Rosa Clemente, the 2008 vice presidential nominee for the Green Party, told CNN's W. Kamau Bell.  After Sunday's successful fifth vote, the next step is another vote in October. Then there would need to be a statute passed by Congress that would lay out the details of the transition process over the next few years, which would end with statehood. If Congress does not pass a statute, Puerto Rico's status would remain as it is. Brother, can you spare a dime? The economy in Puerto Rico is in bad shape. Really bad shape, considering the commonwealth  declared a form of bankruptcy on May 3  after having already defaulted a couple of times. Previously,  Detroit's was the largest filing by a municipality in US history; it owed about $18 billion . Now Puerto Rico holds that record, owing its creditors $73 billion.  What happened? Unemployment is high,  holding steady about 11.5% since March , and almost half  the population is below the poverty level, about 46%.  The  team at CNN Money determined in 2016 that over time, the Puerto Rican government flat out spent too much , possibly because of a translation error in its constitution. Also, some laws had been changed by Congress, erasing tax breaks and business incentives Puerto Rico was counting on.  Plus, a lot of people moved away.  Statehood for Puerto Rico could help the island's economy bounce back faster because more money would come in from federal spending on programs (but keep in mind the offset for federal revenue from individual and corporate taxes). Fight or flight As of 2016, 3.4 million people called Puerto Rico home. If someone moves from Puerto Rico to the mainland, they are migrating. Remember, they're citizens, so they don't need passports or visas. In 2015, about  89,000 Puerto Ricans moved to the US mainland , a record high, according to analysis by the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics, though about 25,000 returned to the island that year. Why is everybody taking off?  A 2014 report by the Pew Research Center on Hispanic Trends  indicates a variety of reasons, from opportunities for better jobs, higher salaries and nicer places to live. This leaves fewer people back home to pick up the slack, which means lower birthrates and less tax revenue to help get the economy back on track.  In March 2014, Edwin Melendez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York, told CNN, "" In Puerto Rico, there's a generalized perspective that there's a 'brain drain' because so many young professionals have left, ""  Melendez said, ""but they aren't the only ones leaving. It's also labor workers and families."" On the flip side, some people and businesses see valuable financial benefits in moving to Puerto Rico. Two laws enacted in 2012 give tax breaks to nonresidents and tax exemptions on investments for residents. The crossroads of the Caribbean The island brings in nearly  $4 billion annually through the tourism industry, and hosts about 10 million visitors via the airports , according to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. Multiple cruise lines make stops at the port of San Juan, adding even more visitors to the mix. El Yunque National Forest, the San Juan Historic Site, which includes Fort San Cristóbal, plus beautiful beaches and the streets of Old San Juan draw hordes of visitors.  Unfortunately,  the Zika virus, an illness spread through mosquito bites that causes birth defects and other neurological issues , has affected tourism numbers. More than 40,000 cases have been reported there since the epidemic began, and a public health emergency was declared. In June,  the governor's office announced the epidemic was over.  What it means to be Puerto Rican Puerto Rico's ethnic heritage is a blend of European, indigenous and African cultures. There's no one way to describe how native Puerto Ricans look today, former Miss Puerto Rico Universe Ingrid Rivera told Kamau Bell. ""You can see absolutely everything here.""  Having Puerto Rican roots is like belonging to a huge, close-knit family, and those members who achieve success on the international stage are a source of immense pride back home.  Take  US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose family moved from Puerto Rico to the Bronx in the 1940s . The first Hispanic to sit on the nation's high court, she was sworn in in 2009. Sotomayor is treated like a rock star during her regular visits to Puerto Rico for speaking engagements. Puerto Rican native Rita Moreno  summed up the importance of her heritage by recounting to  NPR's ""Weekend Edition"" in 2013  that her best supporting actress Oscar win for ""West Side Story"" (1961) became even more meaningful after she learned the Puerto Rican community had been cheering her on.  ""(I)t really put me back in touch with my people, and I had a people. I had a people who knew all about me. I just didn't know about them.""

202,Everything you need to know about Puerto Rico's possible statehood,AJ Willingham,6/12/17," Could Puerto Rico become the 51st US state? That's the question of the day after Puerto Ricans voted overwhelmingly for statehood during a nonbinding weekend referendum. There are a few catches, though: Only 23% of eligible citizens voted, and, well, there's plenty of red tape on the way to becoming a state. Here are the basics:  What exactly is Puerto Rico to the United States?  Puerto Rico is officially a US Commonwealth. The island came under US control in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, but it wasn't until 1952 that Puerto Rico and the United States officially approved a federal law making it a commonwealth.  As residents of a US commonwealth , Puerto Ricans: -- Have their own constitution -- Have their own governor  -- Only pay federal income tax on work done within the United States  -- Pay into Social Security and have access to Medicare and Medicaid, but not some other government programs -- Do not have a vote in the US Congress -- Can vote in presidential primary elections, but not in presidential elections  -- Are natural-born US citizens It is also worth a note that there are a million more Puerto Ricans who live in the mainland United States than live in Puerto Rico.  Why do some Puerto Ricans want statehood?  After this weekend's election, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said statehood voters were ""claiming [their] equal rights as American citizens.""  However, it goes deeper than that. Puerto Rico is in an economic crisis.  The commonwealth filed for municipal bankruptcy in May , and is in the hole for $70 billion owed to various creditors. Poverty is rampant, unemployment is high -- 11.5% -- and statehood supporters, including Rosselló, say the move could boost Puerto Rico's economy. This is far from the first time the question of statehood has been posed to the Puerto Rican people, and it hasn't always been so popular. Votes were held in 1967, 1991,1993, 1998 and 2012. The 2012 referendum was the first time the popular vote swung in statehood's favor. Since these votes were nonbinding referendums, no action had to be taken, and indeed, no action was.  At the time,  political analysts said the 2012 vote didn't necessarily indicate an overwhelming desire for statehood , but rather an overwhelming desire for a status change in general, whether it be statehood, independence or some other solution.  How could they even become a state?  It's Congress' call. To become the 51st state, Congress would have to pass a statute to admit Puerto Rico as a state, and conversations around that possibility have obviously been going on for decades.  The generalities of this process are found in the ""New States"" clause in the US Constitution . Every state after the original 13 colonies has been admitted under this directive.  Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US Constitution  ""New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress."" After the vote, Rossello said in a statement that he will visit Washington soon and plead his case for statehood. However, the election's numbers may stifle his argument.  Why was turnout so low?  At first glance, it may look like statehood claimed a victory with this weekend's vote . However, the numbers tell a different story . According to the State Electoral Commission, 518,000 people voted, which represents 23% of eligible voters. For comparison, in 2012, 1.8 million people voted, which was a turnout of 77.5%. So even though the statehood vote ""won,"" 300,000 fewer people voted for that option this year than in 2012.  Why the low turnout? Before the election, opposition parties encouraged citizens to refrain from voting, saying the election was ""rigged"" because of the way the ballot was worded.  An earlier version of the ballot  was rejected by federal officials in April  because it didn't offer an option for voters to indicate they wanted Puerto Rico to stay a commonwealth. Additionally, the Department of Justice pointed out the earlier version of the ballot was ""potentially misleading"" because it implied statehood was the ""only option"" for Puerto Ricans to gain  American citizenship (in fact, Puerto Ricans are US citizens by birth). The ballot was revised after these criticisms, but the skepticism in Puerto Rico remained.  What happens next?  Again, this latest vote was a ""nonbinding referendum,"" so nothing really HAS to happen next. But now there is going to be another vote in October. It's all about convincing Congress, so if the turnout is better and the support is still high, Puerto Rican leaders and statehood supporters will have an even stronger case to lay before Congress.

203,5 facts about Puerto Rico's utter economic misery,Jackie Wattles,5/8/17,"Puerto Rico is in the midst of a bleak economic crisis.  The island has $74 billion in debt and another $50 billion in pension obligations on the books, making its case by far the largest municipal bankruptcy ever filed.    
 
  Court documents in support of Puerto Rico's bankruptcy paint a stark picture of what life is like and just how daunting the crisis is.    1. Fewer than 1 million people have jobs    The island has a population of about 3.5 million people -- and only about 1 million of them are employed. Obviously, not all of them are old enough to work or are looking for a job. But Puerto Rico's unemployment rate topped more than 12% in October and is more than double that of the mainland U.S.    The lack of jobs, particularly well-paying jobs, has also led to a population exodus in Puerto Rico. The island's population has dropped 10% since 2007.   ""Negative economic growth has persisted for nine of the last ten years along with population diminution highlighted by exiting young doctors and other professionals,"" according to the bankruptcy documents.   CNNMoney has found that  doctors are leaving Puerto Rico at a rate of one per day .    2. It owes $8 million to Microsoft    Court filings reveal the 20 creditors to which Puerto Rico owes the most money. The biggest debt, $12 billion, is owed to the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, which is the trustee on the massive bonds the island has issued to help fund day-to-day operations.   But there are some other notable names on the list. Puerto Rico owes Microsoft more than $8 million for ""services"" the software company has provided. It also owes $3.2 million to Manpower, a talent recruitment agency.   None of the companies immediately responded to a request for comment about the debt.    3. Puerto Rico could face 'many' creditor lawsuits    The island faced at least 22 lawsuits from creditors at the time its bankruptcy documents were filed May 3.   Bankruptcy could help Puerto Rico remain protected from them.   A law called PROMESA (Spanish for ""promise"") originally safeguarded the island from the suits. While that law's protections expired May 1, the bankruptcy filing created a new shield for Puerto Rico.   If a federal judge declines to take the case, however, Puerto Rico could be thrown back into a legal shark tank.    4. Cutting Obamacare funds will make crisis 'exponentially' worse    One document in the filing says that Puerto Rican residents and creditors are ""victims of a crisis situation exponentially getting worse.""   The filing claims the island is set to lose hundreds of millions in funding from the Affordable Care Act next year. And it adds that losing the funding is projected to cost the commonwealth more than $16 billion over the next decade.    5. Pension programs are drying up    The three main retirement systems in Puerto Rico are expected to ""deplete"" all their assets between July and December, the documents say.   The commonwealth says it has already made extensive pension system reforms that will reduce future benefits, and that there are more reforms in the works. But the government and employers have been overpromising while not paying enough into the pension systems.   That leaves the system for public employees ""severely underfunded,"" according to the court filings.    CNNMoney wants to hear from you: Do you live in Puerto Rico?

204,Puerto Rico files for biggest US municipal bankruptcy,Heather Long,5/3/17,"Puerto Rico has filed for bankruptcy.  It's the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing ever in the US. Puerto Rico currently owes its creditors a whopping  $70 billion , far higher than Detroit's  $18 billion bankruptcy  in 2013.    
 
  ""Given the deficit that we have inherited, it is my responsibility to guarantee the best interests of the Puerto Rican people,"" Governor Ricardo Rosselló said Wednesday.   Bankruptcy won't be an easy process. A judge still has to approve it. Many prominent Wall Street firms own Puerto Rico's bonds. They are angry about the bankruptcy filing because they fear now they won't get paid back all the money they are owed.   Puerto Rico's situation is ugly. The island has been in an economic recession for about a decade and the unemployment rate is 11.5%.    The island's financial crisis is so bad that Congress  installed a Fiscal Oversight Board  to call the shots last year. The board stopped trying to negotiate with creditors this week and  filed for bankruptcy .   ""Make no mistake: The board has chosen to turn Puerto Rico into the next Argentina,"" says Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, who is advising some of Puerto Rico's bondholders.     Trump says no bailout     On the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he would  not ""bail out"" Puerto Rico . He repeated that again in a recent tweet.   Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, said Wednesday that the White House pushed hard to ensure no federal dollars would go toward paying the island's debts in the latest Congressional budget deal.   People are literally fleeing Puerto Rico to go and live in the mainland US, especially Florida. The island's population has declined by 350,000 in the past 10 years. Even worse, CNNMoney found that  a doctor a day  has left Puerto Rico, causing a severe shortage of medical help as the island was fighting the Zika crisis.   As businesses and people say goodbye to Puerto Rico, there's even less money to pay back creditors. The island's latest budget plan includes only $800 million a year to pay back creditors. That's a mere 20% of what the island had been paying creditors in the past.     Special Title III process for Puerto Rico    The bankruptcy process is a ""positive step,"" says Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service.   ""Although a court proceeding will take considerable time and likely involve losses for all Puerto Rico bondholders, it will be an orderly process,"" Hampton says.   Last year, Congress approved a bill called PROMESA (Spanish for ""promise"") to try to help Puerto Rico. It created the oversight board and a special Title III process that is similar to the Chapter 9 bankruptcy provision that cities like Detroit have used in the past. Chapter 9 isn't an option for Puerto Rico since it is a US territory.    CNN wants to hear from you: Do you live in Puerto Rico? Or did you grow up in Puerto Rico and then leave?

120,Two Of Puerto Rico’s New Overlords Are Accused Of Helping Create Its Debt Crisis,Daniel Marans,12/17/16,"Activists are calling for the resignation of two members of Puerto Rico’s fiscal control board over the roles they previously played in boosting bank profits at the expense of the island’s financial health.The control board, which has veto power over major Puerto Rican budget decisions, wascreated by Congress in June as the island foundered under $70 billion in public debt. A new report, titled “Pirates of the Caribbean,” argues that control board members José Ramon Gonzalez and Carlos Garcia should be held accountable for their part in plunging the island into debt. The paper, released Thursday, comes from two progressive coalitions, Hedge Clippers and the Committee for Better Banks, which both seek to combat the political power of financial institutions.Before they were appointed to the control board, Gonzalez and Garcia moved between top positions in Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank (GDB), which issues the island’s government bonds, and Banco Santander, the Spanish-owned mega-bank that was buying and structuring the vast majority of those same obligations.The report alleges that Garcia, Gonzalez and other executives at Santander presided over an explosion of lucrative underwriting that allowed the financially strapped island to continue borrowing huge sums, but on increasingly risky terms. The structure of those loans, the report suggests, was more favorable to Santander and other financial institutions than to the government ― and thus the taxpayers.Santander participated in the underwriting of $61.2 billion of the island’s $70 billion in debt, according to the analysis. The report estimates that more than $1 billion went toward management fees for Santander and other banks. The island shelled out another estimated $735 million to the banks to cancel interest rate swaps ― bets the government had made on future interest rates.For the loans it underwrote, Santander frequently set up onerous payment structures using exotic financial tools, the report says. For example, the Santander loans cost Puerto Rico $1.5 billion in “capitalized” interest payments ― that is, the island was also borrowing to pay the interest on its loans. And complicated 2009 bond issue that Santander underwrote netted Puerto Rico $139 million, but required it to pay back $730 million ― five times the value of the loan ― according to the report.Gonzalez and Garcia held top jobs at the private bank as it profited off Puerto Rican taxpayers, when they weren’t running the government entity that was issuing those bonds.Gonzalez, who had been president of the GDB from 1986 to 1989, became head of Santander Securities, the arm of the bank that underwrote Puerto Rican debt, in 1996. In 2002, he moved up to CEO of Santander’s Puerto Rican holding company, a job he held until 2008.Garcia similarly began working in Santander’s Puerto Rican operations in the late 1990s and held a number of leadership roles. He left the bank in 2009 to become president of the GDB and returned to Santander in 2011 for another top executive job.The revolving door similarly spun for others in Puerto Rico’s banking community. Juan Carlos Batlle, another Santander executive, took Garcia’s place as chief of the GDB in 2011. At the same time, Batlle’s brother Fernando left a top post at the GDB to head up Santander Securities.As Puerto Rico’s debt rose, the island’s elected officials began pushing the burden of repayment onto the public. Beginning in 2009, then-Gov. Luis Fortuño instituted major austerity measures, laying off tens of thousands of public employees.“Santander and other banks purposefully manipulated a government desperate to avoid financial ruin and shared in over a billion in collected profit as it pushed Puerto Ricans deeper and deeper into nearly unrecoverable poverty,” Stephen Lerner of the Hedge Clippers coalition said in a statement accompanying the report. “Santander, as well as former Santander executives who now serve on the fiscal control board, must pay the price.”Hedge Clippers and the Committee for Better Banks, which held a press conference to promote the report Thursday outside Santander Holdings USA headquarters in Boston, are asking the bank to refund the underwriting fees it charged Puerto Rico and urging Garcia and Gonzalez to resign from the fiscal control board.They also want the control board and the Puerto Rican government to allow a government-sponsored commission currently auditing the island’s public debt to complete its work with adequate funding. Governor-elect Ricardo Rossello, who will assume office in January, has not been completely clear about his plans for the commission.It is unlikely that Santander, Gonzalez and Garcia will agree to the activists’ demands.Neither Garcia nor Gonzalez responded to a request for comment.Santander Holdings USA declined to address the demands of the report, but offered a general statement about the bank’s interaction with the Puerto Rican government.“In the financial services industry, it is not uncommon for business leaders to work in the private sector and then move on to serve in government,” said spokeswoman Ann Davis. “It is also common industry practice for financial institutions, like Santander, to underwrite bonds and issue financial instruments to support economic growth ...,” she added. “The public and private sectors have guidelines in place to prevent conflicts of interest and Santander has always required strict adherence to these guidelines to ensure ethical business practices.”But Thursday’s report provides new ammunition to the people and groups in Puerto Rico and the mainland United States who have long argued that banks and other financial institutions should be held to account for their role in facilitating and exacerbating Puerto Rico’s debt crisis.“This report provides more evidence that the people who created the crisis also profited from the crisis,” said professor Charles Venator, a specialist in Puerto Rican politics at the University of Connecticut.The average Puerto Rican has not similarly benefited. The austerity measures adopted to address the massive debt ― which many experts believe Puerto Rico will never be able to pay off ― have sparked an increase in poverty and a decrease in public health. Puerto Ricans have flocked to the mainland U.S. to escape deteriorating living conditions. The island’s population dropped almost 7 percent from 2010 to 2015, leaving fewer residents to generate the revenue needed to fund the government.Now the fiscal control board is demanding more austerity, insisting that outgoing Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla scale back his proposed budget.To be sure, the authors of the new report have their own stake in how the island chooses to distribute the financial pain. Both Hedge Clippers and the Committee for Better Banks have among their coalition members labor unions representing workers in Puerto Rico, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Communications Workers of America.But the composition of the control board is a matter of concern for all Puerto Ricans, said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate at Public Citizen.“If Puerto Ricans are required to suffer broken promises as debt is restructured, the least they should receive is oversight from officials completely disconnected from the mess-making, let alone those who profit from it,” Naylor said.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-control-board-debt-crisis_n_58544d53e4b0390447088ce4,HuffPost,Liberal
121,Puerto Rico's Blackout and National Resilience,"Dante Disparte, Contributor",9/28/16,"While electricity will eventually return to Puerto Rico following a massive island-wide blackout that left 1.5 million residents in darkness, it may take decades to return the island to a solid footing. The confluence of unfortunate events hurting the U.S. territory are of both the acute and attritional variety. The blackout, however, is an entirely predictable outcome resulting from decades of mismanagement and under-investment in the backbone of any modern economy - namely the electricity grid. In short, bad things happen in the dark. Not only are Puerto Rican's suffering from extortionately high energy costs averaging between 4-6 times higher than the U.S. mainland, their comparatively low GDP per capita under $20,000 compared to $52,000, makes the blackout a painful punctuation mark in an otherwise cruel joke. The resilient Puerto Ricans remained calm in the face of another setback and many had a fiesta. At the center of this joke is the island's sclerotic and bankrupt public utility, PREPA. Anywhere else in the world, there would be serious movement towards privatization or some hybrid public-private model to electrification and distribution, which in Puerto Rico's case would also ease the burden on the public balance sheet. In Puerto Rico, whose financial matters are now in the hands of a Federally-appointed financial control board, this type of bold move may prove politically risky for the board and the island's elected officials and unpalatable to an otherwise paralyzed Washington griped by a farcical presidential race and bitter partisanship. The island is at once ground-zero for the U.S. municipal debt crisis, with an eye-watering $73 billion in public debt, the Zika virus, which has affected 1 in 5 Puerto Ricans and crippled its tourism industry, and, with this blackout, an emblem of America's poor infrastructure scorecard and lack of resilience. All of these crises pose a real risk of contagion to the broader safety and security of the U.S. The Zika-carrying aedes aegypti mosquito, like financial contagion to the municipal bond market and broader economy, do not respect borders. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an unprecedented travel warning in the contiguous U.S. to avoid travel to parts of Florida. It should be of no comfort that the endemic aedes aegypti mosquito plays host to dengue, yellow-fever and chikunkunya, among other vector-borne diseases whose inexorable march north is fueled by globalization and climate change.The blackout in Puerto Rico, like the forgotten water crisis in Flint, Michigan, is emblematic of the broader deterioration of critical infrastructure in the U.S. The lack of long range focus and an investment strategy that goes beyond maintenance and Band-Aid fixes and aims for broad infrastructure modernization is the only way to build a resilient country - one that does not buckle under the strain of normal use or modern commerce and collapse in the face of wide ranging threats from cyber risk, tree-branches and acts of nature. Puerto Rico, like Flint, Detroit, New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other forgotten American communities need not strain on public finance and goodwill. Rather these great cities and territories are perfect proving grounds for building a resilient national future. The costliest of interventions, like with the medical system or sending the military to combat Ebola, are when uninsured patients arrive in an emergency room. Instead of letting our fellow citizens' fall through the cracks in our poorest and most vulnerable communities, we have an opportunity and an obligation as one nation to meaningfully invest and pilot new approaches to thriving and surviving in increasingly turbulent times.Some long forgotten tools in our tool kit, which we were prepared to leverage to wage wars and rebuild Europe, include the issuance of national infrastructure bonds creating an investment horizon long enough to remove, rebuild and retrofit critical infrastructure. In Puerto Rico's case, immediately lifting the Merchant Marine or Jones Act, would enable alternative energy sources, such as propane and liquefied natural gas (LNG), along with all others goods to be imported to the island with more competitive landed costs. Customers of companies like Tropigas, a local propane and energy efficiency firm, were among the only ones with their lights on thanks to residential and industrial-scale generation equipment and an island-wide distribution network. While getting off the energy grid entirely is not the answer, having viable cogeneration alternatives will not only create redundancy, it will help ease the burden on an aging and inefficient system. Critically, lest Puerto Rico loses its industrial base like it is losing its middle class, cogeneration is a solution to keeping hotels, pharmaceutical and industrial firms on the island with reliable, redundant and cost-effective energy.  The risk of large-scale blackouts has grown increasingly likely with the advent of sophisticated cyber-attacks against energy infrastructure. Lloyd's, the world's specialist insurance market, estimates that a cyber-attack against the U.S. energy grid would cost the economy between$243 billion and $1 trillion depending on the severity of the attack. On a lower scale, the 2003 Great Blackout exacted a heavy toll on the U.S. estimated at $8.2 billion, crippling the country's financial center, New York, showing that cities are increasingly in the cross-hairs of unpredictable risks. It is widely accepted that risks are to be avoided. Resilience on the other hand is something we can accurately measure, plan for and invest in. Puerto Rico's blackout, like our other forgotten crises, remind us it is time to act.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
122,Dark Star: Puerto Rico Reels From 3-Day Blackout,"Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",9/26/16,"Puerto Rico has emerged bewildered from a three-night national blackout, which affected 1.5 million customers, left 250,000 without water service, and prompted estimates of close to $1 billion in immediate economic losses, along with incalculable future repercussions.Sleep cooled by air conditioning or electric fans in tropical temps of 80-plus degrees Fahrenheit became a sudden luxury over the weekend in this Caribbean country, now known as much for its debt crisis as for its salsa music.For most -- but not all -- the nightmare ended over the weekend, shifting to the task of throwing out damaged food. Residents of the housing project Residencial El Prado in Río Piedras reported ""que llegó la luz"" or that the lights came back at about 3 a.m. this Monday morning. Not surprisingly, and in the wake of $43 million in local public funds being paid to debt restructuring expert Lisa Donahue and the company Alix Partners, there is now talk of privatizing Puerto Rico's electric utility. But with infamous examples of energy firms such as Enron, privatization has long stopped being seen as a panacea.The historic collapse of basic services -- caused by a fire Wednesday afternoon at a major plant initially blamed on poor maintenance -- culminated fittingly on Friday, September 23, known as Grito de Lares Day, an unofficial holiday in this U.S. territory of 3.4 million American citizens, which officially marks U.S. and local holidays, from Thanksgiving to Abolition of Slavery Day. Sacred to the country's independence supporters, el Grito de Lares, or the Cry from Lares, is named for the rural town of the interior where in 1868 an insurrection against Spanish colonialism briefly declared Puerto Rico independent before being crushed by the authorities. Thousands of independence supporters traditionally make the pilgrimage to Lares every year to commemorate the day with speeches, music and traditional food and artisan vendors. The most memorable of recent history was in 2005, when the FBI chose that date to raid the home of and kill Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, a militant leader of the Ejército Popular Boricua (Boricua Popular Army), who had lived underground for many years. Leaders across Puerto Rico's political spectrum decried his killing at the time, as the FBI reportedly acted without informing local authorities, and a wounded Ojeda Ríos bled to death without medical attention. In the aftermath, photo exhibits and artistic tributes repeatedly featured a searing image of the blood-stained steps at the doorway of his home where he died. On this year's Grito de Lares, the entire country seemed to be mortally wounded and being left for dead. The blackout spells the collapse of the Free Associated State -- or ""Commonwealth"" as Puerto Rico has been called euphemistically -- in even more tangible terms than all the seismic events of the past year, including two U.S. Supreme Court rulings that annulled Puerto Rico's Constitution and sovereignty -- or exposed it as the apparent lie it always was. The blackout also portends the coming storm of the federally-imposed fiscal control board, instituted as part of PROMESA, the Orwellian-sounding law named for its acronym, Spanish for ""promise."" President Obama's recently announced appointees to the fiscal control board promise neoliberal economic austerity to do the bidding of vulture hedge funds, as well as social unrest.The first conference for collaborators of PROMESA, sponsored by the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce at the Condado Plaza Hotel on August 31, was shut down by hundreds of protestors who confronted riot police, some brandishing home-made shields emblazoned with black Puerto Rican flags, a motif started by local artists who stripped the flag of its bright colors on a popular public art display in Old San Juan to signify resistance. And a protest occupation has set camp for the long haul at the federal courthouse in San Juan since PROMESA was signed into law on June 30. PROMESA was passed with a proverbial gun to the country's head, as a July 1 default deadline loomed on payment to the $72 billion debt, with more layers of creditors than top experts involved claim to have ever encountered. Yet the law's one clear benefit, to temporarily delay a tsunami of lawsuits, is now being challenged in federal court, with the same judge presiding who months ago ruled against Puerto Rico's attempt to file bankruptcy for its embattled electric utility. PROMESA's fiscal control board is now set to convene at Hamilton Custom House this Friday in New York, home to 850,000 Puerto Ricans from a politically established stateside diaspora, which for over a decade now has outnumbered residents on the island, with a record 89,000 leaving last year.The board became even more controversial with President Obama's recent appointment of Carlos García, a key figure in the administration of previous Governor Luis Fortuño, who was booted out of office by a long-standing tradition in Puerto Rican elections called voto de castigo or punishment vote. García was a key figure in Fortuño's administration, president of the now nearly insolvent Government Development Bank, and an architect of Law 7, used to lay off thousands of public employees and annul public sector union contracts, later mirrored in the policies of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Because of García's involvement in issuing predatory debt for Puerto Rico, his appointment has been characterized as a conflict of interest.A federal fiscal control board in Puerto Rico is often compared to previous incarnations in Washington, D.C. and Detroit, an attempt to normalize what the United Nations defines in international criminal terms as colonialism. But Washington, D.C. and Detroit are not U.S. territories; while D.C. has clamored for statehood, it does not have an independence movement. Yet one telling parallel is that the hardest hit communities in both cities are African-American, as Puerto Rico is treated in federal terms as an ethno-racial ""minority"" population. It's no accident that Black Lives Matter uprisings, along with indigenous occupation against the Dakota Access Pipeline by the Sioux at Standing Rock, coincide with Puerto Rico's crisis.This was recently made explicit in a widely-publicized speech by federal judge Juan R. Torruella, who traced the legal lineage of PROMESA to such past infamous U.S. Supreme Court rulings that justified and perpetuated the Jim Crow era. He concluded by calling for Puerto Ricans to organize an economic boycott of U.S. businesses and imports. That's a tall order for a country so steeped in consumption, and where 85 percent of food is imported, evident during the blackout with long lines for ice, gas and other goods, wherever businesses with generators managed to stay open. Such purchases seemed an ephemeral consolation. Even the customary hospitality and humor of Puerto Ricans could not blunt the shock of a nation-wide blackout that lasted three plus days. ""The damage now is to the psyche,"" said one municipal employee reporting to work this Monday morning. Outside, a candle-lit gathering Thursday night, a neighbor from an exclusive enclave near the governor's mansion in beautiful Old San Juan looked up at his darkened balcony and remarked, ""I thought the country was developed.""It is as if Puerto Rico was submitted to what Naomi Klein calls ""shock doctrine,"" only without electricity.A common phrase among anti-colonial activists here ¡Despierta -- Wake Up -- Boricua! invokes Puerto Ricans echoing the island's long colonial history with its original Taino name, Borinquen. The silent, pitch-black nights of this national power outage have been a rude awakening indeed.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
205,Nearly 1.5 million without power in Puerto Rico,"Jeffrey Acevedo, Nelson Quiñones and Joshua Berlinger",9/22/16," Puerto Rico has gone dark. A power outage on the island has left nearly 1.5 million people without power, according to a statement from the government-run electric company AEE.  The blackout is affecting most of the US territory, causing traffic jams and forcing business closures. About 12 hours into the blackout power had been restored to just over 130,000 customers, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla said Thursday morning.That still left about a third of the population without power.AEE said the blackout began late Wednesday after a fire at its Aguirre power plant. Fire Chief Angel Crespo said a power switch got overheated, causing a 2,000-gallon mineral oil tank to explode. Fire spread over a 3-acre area before firefighters managed to put it out. The power outage also shut off water service for about 340,000 people, the governor said. Public schools canceled classes and government employees were asked to work limited hours. Many private institutions followed suit. García Padilla said they expect to get power back up for most people sometime this afternoon. However, he made it clear it wasn't a promise and the timeline could change. ""I don't want to give false expectations. Lots of setbacks may occur,"" he said. Telecommunications services are working normally, according to the governor. The Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport continues to operate, García Padilla said, but he asked passengers to get there earlier than usual. Passengers are being checked in manually to preserve power.",https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/americas/puerto-rico-power-outage/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWvqeq5sj6AhU2ZDABHdJ_Aks4yAEQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw2ewtqVUSpPqVXsDuyPFn09,CNN,Liberal
123,"No USA, You Can’t Claim Monica Puig’s Puerto Rico Gold Medal Win As Your Own","Lynnette Cantos, Contributor",8/17/16,"Like manyboricuas on Saturday, Aug. 13, I celebrated when tennis player Monica Puig won gold in the single women’s division and became bothPuerto Rico’s first gold win and a woman’s first gold win for the island.Needless to say, it was an overall historic moment that everyone back in the island and all theboricuas in the United States (such as myself) basked in with full pride, loud cheers and immense glory—as only a Puerto Rican would do.Until the same day and onward, I’ve noticed a trend on social media regarding the Olympics: multiple posts and tweets about how Puerto Rico shouldn’t compete independently, confused as to why Puerto Rico is competing in the first place or that a victory for Puerto Rico supposedly “counts” because it’s a U.S. commonwealth.Puerto Rico has a population of 3.5 million citizens, its own national anthem and its own unique culture. However, we are considered U.S. citizens on paper due to the Jones Act of 1917. Even though we share the same currency, passport and social security, we are not guaranteed the same rights such as voting on presidential elections and bankruptcy protection.Simply put: yes, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory but it still qualifies as a competing nation under the International Olympic Committee, a non-governmental organization, since January 1, 1948. It’s also why other U.S. territories compete as stand-alone countries such as Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.No, and it’s mainly that last example above that urged me to write this post. For so long I’ve watched how little we’ve mattered to Americans, both living in the United States and growing up in the rural mountainside seven miles off of San Juan, until something extraordinary happens to us like Puig’s gold win.When I see tweets about “claiming” Puerto Rico’s gold medal victory as one for the U.S., I can’t help but think about the toxic colonialist history behind such statements and the modern micro-aggressions faced as a Puerto Rican in this day and age. I can’t help but think about how everyday, Puerto Ricans struggle with their identity because of the purgatory commonwealth status of our island. I can’t help but to think about how silent the Hamilton fandom can be on our issues when Lin-Manuel Miranda constantly advocates for Puerto Rico, whether to U.S. Congress or on HBO with John Oliver.And with all of this, an underdog story such as Puig happens under our representation and you want to “claim” and “count” the winning for the U.S.? Even though she lives and trains in Florida and chose to represent Puerto Rico instead? Even though U.S. media broadcasted the following info graph below in order to minimize our accomplishment?After everything that Puerto Rico is facing, from our island’s debt crisis to Zika outbreak state of emergency, Monica Puig’s outstanding achievement is the small gleam of hope that Puerto Rico never knew it needed until now.The sheer moment that La Borinqueña, our national anthem played as footage of the flag rose high and Puig was in tears, wrapped around her own Puerto Rico flag will stick with every boricua from this moment onward. She even told The New York Times how much love and support our community has given her and why she chose to be “100 percent loyal” by representing Puerto Rico, despite growing up and training in the U.S.Her victory and our spirit are strong gestures that nobody should even dare to “claim” or “count” for their own benefits.A version of this post originally appeared on Medium.",[],HuffPost,Liberal

The spoken word artist then recited a powerful poem about Puerto Rico’s resilience and strength from the perspective of the island. “I have been a refuge politico (political refuge) to the French, the Dutch, the Spanish, the English, the Catholics, the soldiers, the tourists ― I’ve treated everyone as equal and now there is war against my Puerto Rican people,” she said. “We are fighting an elusive creature that owns me as its paraíso (paradise).” De la Luz then recounts how the island was essentially colonized by the United States, andnow is left to deal with a crippling debt crisis that’s taken a massive human toll:We were offered fool’s gold while they robbed us of a share hold. While the nacionalistas (nationalists) foretold the takeover of control, we danced and fell into the American mold. We warmed ourselves with tropical memories while facing the American cold. But what is untold we will expose. There are no more cheeks to turn, though the hypocrisy has left us holding two faces. We’ve been slapped with debt we didn’t earn. Told to strap up our boots but left without shoelaces. The boricua continues with references to Puerto Rico’s case for statehood, foreign sector’s preying on the island andthe island’s biggest mass exodus since the 1950s. “And if you ask me right now what it is that I am thinking. I’m holding my people in a foot of water to stop them from sinking,” she recited. “They would see the richness of my power if they started interlinking and the colonial mindset would start collectively shrinking. So stand up my children, we will always be connected.”The poem closes with a powerful message to everyone who views the island as inferior or property: “We are not poor but rico. We are not yours but equal.” Watch the full poem in the video above.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/this-powerful-poem-is-an-ode-to-puerto-ricos-incredible-resilience_n_57a87c77e4b056bad215fe11,HuffPost,Liberal
206,Puerto Rico makes historic default,Heather Long,7/1/16,"Puerto Rico just did something that hasn't happened since 1933.  The  deeply indebted  island defaulted Friday on debt that is supposed to be guaranteed by the Puerto Rican constitution. In other words, Puerto Rico was supposed to pay creditors who hold general obligation bonds before paying anyone else, even police.    
 
  But Governor Alejandro García Padilla said: No. He argued that paying teachers, emergency personnel and other critical needs must come first.   ""This administration continues to take historic steps to ensure the residents of Puerto Rico continue to receive essential services while the commonwealth continues to face a delicate financial situation,"" a spokesman said Thursday.   The island isn't planning to make any of the $800 million payment to its bondholders due on July 1. Puerto Rico's government says it is in a ""dire"" financial position with only about $350 million in cash on hand right now.    Puerto Rico's default Friday marks the first time that a state or state-like entity (Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory) has failed to pay general obligation bonds since the Great Depression.    The default was expected, and thus isn't causing much havoc in the wider bond market. The island is over $70 billion in debt -- about $20,000 per island resident. Puerto Rico has  already defaulted  three times on other types of bonds, and it has warned for months that it wouldn't have the money to pay for this debt either.   There is some dispute about whether Puerto Rico is really out of money. On Friday, the island finally released its long overdue  audited financial statements  for 2014.   ""It's really troubling from a creditor point of view,"" Dominic Frederico, CEO of Assured Guaranty, said recently at a conference. His company is one of the insurers of Puerto Rico's debt that's made it clear it won't negotiate further until reviewing reliable numbers.   President Obama and Congress  crafted a rescue bill for the island , a bipartisan compromise meant to create an orderly process to come to some sort of compromise between the island and the bondholders to work out a re-payment plan.    Obama signed the bill Thursday afternoon. Mere hours later, Governor Padilla issued an executive order saying the island would stop making general obligation bond payments, among other types of bond payments.   Defaults normally trigger lawsuits, but the bill Congress passed forbids bondholders from suing the island for several months. Instead, a fiscal Oversight Board will be appointed soon and tasked with coming up with a plan.    Update July 1 at 3pm to note that Puerto Rico released its audited financial statements for 2014 on Friday.

207,President Obama signs Puerto Rico rescue bill,Heather Long,6/30/16,"Puerto Rico is getting a lifeline from Washington D.C.  On Thursday, President Obama signed a bill known as PROMESA (Spanish for ""promise"") to help Puerto Rico get out of its massive economic crisis.    
 
  The island has run up nearly  $70 billion of debt  (about $20,000 per resident). At the same time, the island's population has shrunk dramatically. Puerto Ricans are moving to Florida, Texas and elsewhere in the mainland U.S. for better paying jobs.   PROMESA was a bipartisan compromise with the Republican House and Senate. Both chambers  approved the bill  by a large margin.   ""There is still much work to be done. With legislation in place, Puerto Rico will now have time to work out an orderly financial path forward after July 1,"" Obama's Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Wednesday night after the Senate approved PROMESA.      Puerto Rico still expected to default July 1    Puerto Rico is widely expected to miss most, if not all, of the $2 billion bond payment it owes creditors by July 1. The island says it doesn't have enough money to pay.   PROMESA won't provide any funding to pay the debt, but it does prevent bondholders from suing the island for a few months. It also installs a fiscal Oversight Board to come up with a plan to finally solve the crisis. That plan may ultimately include giving creditors a ""haircut"" where they receive less money back or get delayed payments.   ""We are in favor of PROMESA,"" says Jorge Irizarry. He's the head of Bonistas del Patio, a group representing the more than  60,000 Puerto Ricans  who own some of the bonds that are in trouble. ""We need economic growth. That's the only thing that will get Puerto Rico back on its feet.""    Why July 1 is so important    Puerto Rico has  already defaulted three times , but the July 1 payment is different.   If Puerto Rico misses this one, it will be the first time since 1933 that a state or territory (Puerto Rico is a territory under U.S. law) fails to pay its general obligation bonds on time, says Cate Long, an expert on government bonds and head of the Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a research firm.   General obligation bonds are the creme de la creme of the bond world. Payment is generally guaranteed.   ""In the Puerto Rican constitution it requires the general obligation bond payment to be made before any other expenditure of the government,"" says Long.    Puerto Rico's economy has been contracting for almost a decade. People are literally fleeing the island in search of  jobs  in the mainland U.S. The island has lost about 10% of its population in the past decade.   Taxes have gone up. Services have gone down.  Home prices are plummeting , and a  doctor a day  is leaving the island.   PROMESA also creates a commission to study how to jumpstart the economy again and what else Congress can do to help.    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton endorsed the plan. Republican Donald Trump said he would not support a ""bailout"" for the island, although Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, point out that this is not a bailout since no federal taxpayers dollars are used to pay the island's debt.

127,The United States Makes The Case For Why Puerto Rico Is Still Its Colony,"Juan Cartagena, Contributor",6/14/16,"Today colonialism stands exposed in its unrelenting and unapologetic display of dominance and control. As Congress prepares to vote on arestructuring package for Puerto Rico that includes the imposition of a federal fiscal control board that will be composed primarily of bankers, financial sector ""experts"" and lawyers and will retain powers far greater than democracy itself, the Supreme Court has just made clear for the first time in 100 years that Puerto Rico has no sovereignty, save that granted to it by Congress. And the Obama administration has expressed its support for both positions, having advocated for the control board andagainst any notion of dual sovereignty for the island. All branches of the federal government have made it explicitly clear recently that in case you believed otherwise, Puerto Rico is in fact a colony of the United States, despite colonialism beingillegal and immoral.Ironically, the Court's decision in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle retraces the colonial history of Puerto Rico under United States control, in painful and painstaking detail, describing how any semblance of self-governance exercised by the people of Puerto Rico was only allowed because Congress permitted and approved of it, including the creation of the island's constitution. That constitution was drafted to recognize social and economic rights a few years after they had been established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized by the international community as being essential to the realization of all rights. Yet, as the Court reminds us, when the constitution was submitted for ultimate approval -- not to the people of Puerto Rico, but to Congress -- those rights (and any amendments that could have led to establishing them) were removed and instead replaced with the right of children to attend private school and protections that prioritize the payment of general obligation bonds (i.e. private creditors such as hedge funds) above the provision of public services. The creation of Puerto Rico's constitution created a ""new kind of political entity,"" which is the legal fiction known as the Free Associated State (Estado Libre Asociado), or a Commonwealth, in order not to refer to Puerto Rico as what it continued to be -- a colony. The Supreme Court said as much, noting that ""Puerto Rico's transformative constitutional moment does not lead to a different conclusion"" that its status as a colony, both before and after U.S. acquisition, changed. Former Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter called this ""inventive statesmanship."" The international community still calls it colonialism. The United Nations has repeatedly affirmed its position with regard to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV), which states that the continued subjugation and domination of a people by a foreign nation violates their fundamental human rights and the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples reaffirms in its resolution each year, as it has done in 33 independent resolutions, the right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination. And that colonial status is nowhere more evident than in the vote taken by Congress recently to pass the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (""PROMESA""). PROMESA, which means ""promise"" in Spanish, offers the island the chance for full debt restructuring, but at the extremely high price of relinquishing self-governance. The bill would impose a federal fiscal control board that would be composed of seven federally-appointed persons with banking, finance and legal backgrounds and who would have the authority to approve, or not, fiscal plans proposed by the Governor and legislature. In other words, a seven-member federal panel composed of private sector bankers and lawyers will be able to determine the fiscal priorities, budgets, funding and establishment of policies over the elected members of Puerto Rico's legislature and its Governor. They will be able to hold secret, closed-door meetings, veto budgets approved by the legislature and order reductions in spending. They will be able to reduce the role of government -- which is fundamentally to act in service of the needs of its citizens in the protection, respect and fulfillment of their rights - in order to prioritize payment of a debt larger than Puerto Rico's Gross National Product (GNP) to private investors. Investors who engaged in financially risky transactions, refused to negotiate, launched a campaign to discourage any federal government assistance (which they called a ""bailout"") and who have openly advocated for continued austerity measures, such as the closure of schools, hospitals and cutting the minimum wage almost in half for young workers. The Congressional Budget Office itself stated that ""the bill would give the oversight board certain sovereign powers over the Puerto Rican government and its instrumentalities."" In essence, the federal fiscal control board will serve as a supra-legislative and executive body, the ultimate privatization of government that is not accountable to the people of Puerto Rico, the very citizenry they are purportedly protecting. Instead, the legislation only requires that they report to Congress, a body where Puerto Rico is not represented by any voting members. And all of this at a bill of $370 million in annual administrative costs to the people of Puerto Rico who never sought an oversight board, nor support it. Colonialism is one of the worst forms of violence because it inflicts itself relentlessly, willfully and repeatedly. Present in every aspect of one's life and for generations, colonialism intentionally attempts to strip away the dignity of a people and nation in order to serve the economic, military and political interest of another. We witness colonialism and its brutal impact day in and day out, but often stand by silently while our government violates the most basic and fundamental rights of millions of citizens -- the right to autonomy, to freedom to sovereignty and to dignity. The same autonomy and self-determination we demand for our bodies, our families, and our political system is also applicable at the nation level. Sovereignty is a fundamental principle and requirement of the most basic of all rights - the right to live a dignified life. It is the very action and policy President Obama assured Cuba - the island neighbor of Puerto Rico with a shared history, flag and struggle - that he would promote in a path towards normalization. He assured the Cuban people that ""we will not impose our political or economic system on you. We recognize that every country, every people, must chart its own course and shape its own model."" And yet nearby, the oldest colony in the hemisphere is still denied what the Supreme Court points out as ""the principle of government by consent."" As is so often the case in the face of atrocities and human rights violations, silence is equated with complicity. A presumed complicity because it is not your family, your home, your community that is being dehumanized. That is true whether it is war on another's soil, torture in foreign military bases, systemic targeting and killing of civilians by law enforcement outside your neighborhood, the separation and detention of immigrant families in another state, the execution of another in our name for our presumed safety, or exploited workers in our favorite restaurant we look away from. Our government acts in our name without our consent constantly; but our presumed consent emboldens it more. It is more than an act of solidarity to stand with those who are oppressed, particularly when the oppression is being done in our name. It is an exercise of freedom, a collective freedom that we are all ensured, and it is our duty to exercise it and often.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
128,Here's Bernie Sanders' Plan To Save Puerto Rico And Stick It To Vulture Funds,Zachary D. Carter,6/13/16,"WASHINGTON -- Puerto Rico's economy has been in a depression for a decade. With the territory likely to default on a $2 billion debt payment on July 1, the island's ugly humanitarian situation could become even more nightmarish. More than half of Puerto Rican children already live in poverty, its unemployment rate is over 12 percent and the government has been closing schools and curbing public services to help make short-term debt payments. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Puerto Rico is barred from requiring vulture funds -- those that invest in distressed debt -- to take haircuts on government bonds. The ruling grants the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over any debt reduction scheme for the U.S. territory. Wall Street hedge funds were thrilled.But the July 1 deadline and the Supreme Court ruling also strengthen the hands of Washington politicians -- including those more enamored with traditional thinking at the International Monetary Fund than with the concerns of American citizens living in Puerto Rico.Thus far, there have been two positions on resolving the Puerto Rican crisis circling through the nation's capital. Vulture funds have pursued a ""screw you, pay me"" strategy that has gained traction with many congressional Republicans, while decimating Puerto Rico's economy. The Obama administration, by contrast, has backed a bipartisan bill to impose further budgetary austerity on the island, coupled with meaningful debt reduction. The bill's austerity intent is clear. It would allow for the minimum wage to be suspended, and would lift President Barack Obama's new overtime pay expansion island-wide. American citizens in Puerto Rico might well ask whether being stripped of labor protections provided to mainlanders is a product of the island's colonial history. It's hard to see what private-sector investment in such plans would encourage other than, say, payday lending.The choice, in other words, is between madness and masochism. So, late last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) quietly unveiled an alternative. Sanders would cut vulture fund investors out of any benefits from a debt-reduction deal, while establishing a long-term infrastructure plan to fix the root problem of Puerto Rico's debt: a dysfunctional local economy. The Sanders bill faces major political headwinds. While Obama's strategy has cleared the House, the executive branch is all but begging the Senate to vote on it in time to avert a July 1 debacle. And Sanders is not exactly an ideological ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose support will be needed to pass any law to salvage the Puerto Rico situation. But the Sanders bill is a clever approach to a problem that could upend traditional thinking on financial crisis management around the world -- one that prioritizes the well-being of Puerto Ricans over Wall Street profits.Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have blessed The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, which Sanders has savaged on the presidential campaign trail. PROMESA would set up a new Washington-appointed oversight board empowered to direct spending and taxation plans for Puerto Rico, and, if all goes well, reduce the the island's overall debt levels. Economists have been all but screaming for a reduction in Puerto Rico's debt for years, and PROMESA marks the first actual attempt to maybe, eventually do something about it. But there are obvious drawbacks to the bill's approach. PROMESA is unpopular on the island, and has been sharply criticized by the territory's governor and and major candidates vying to succeed him. Working out and implementing debt relief may simply prove politically unworkable. Even if the oversight board can impose a plan, the vulture funds that inflamed the island's humanitarian crisis could end up profiting handsomely from it. As Puerto Rico's fiscal situation deteriorated, a lot of investors dumped their bonds at deep discounts, hoping to salvage some of their money instead of losing much more if the island defaulted. But hedge funds that bought up debt at a 20 or 30 cents on the dollar have been driving Puerto Rico's politics ever since, refusing to negotiate with the local government and demanding full payment as the economy falls apart. Since these vulture funds bought the debt on the cheap, even a deal that substantially reduces the face value of their debt could reward them for holding the island financially hostage.Sanders would set up a new government bank empowered to buy up Puerto Rican debt at whatever price bondholders actually paid for it. For early investors who held onto their bonds, including many pension funds, that's clearly a bailout. But it also means zero profit from the ""screw you, pay me"" strategy the vulture funds have pursued. They only get whatever they paid for the debt. The Sanders bill also would allow Puerto Rico to write off debts in bankruptcy -- a right afforded to U.S. states.The Sanders plan obviously entails some level of moral hazard. Investing isn't supposed to be a risk-free proposition. Financial firms earn returns on their investments by shouldering the risk that they might not be repaid. Ensuring that mutual funds, pension funds and other early buyers of Puerto Rico debt continue to be paid in full would send a signal to markets: When reckless governments ask for money at high interest rates, the feds will always be behind you. That could encourage bad investment decisions and bad local government fiscal management.But the same principle applies to the vulture funds that swooped into the Puerto Rico debt markets in recent years, hoping to use political pressure to counter the economic insanity of their bet. Letting them turn a profit on a ploy to immiserate working people and strip them of democratic power sends a pretty strong signal, too. A super-tough debt reduction plan under PROMESA, of course, could wipe out vulture fund gains. But doing so would face serious political opposition from more sympathetic actors -- the pension and mutual funds behind middle-class retirement accounts.PROMESA is ultimately a plan to stave off an immediate calamity with the promise of potentially useful future solutions, followed by further reforms not even included in the law. Hopeful congressional staffers believe that a good PROMESA plan would give hedge funders incentives to support additional Medicaid spending in Puerto Rico and encourage Congress to make the territory eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit -- federal payments to low-income families working in jobs that don't pay well.More cash in thin wallets would give citizens money to spend on goods and services, which can in turn pay workers to provide more goods and services, which could ultimately boost the economy enough to make future debt payments more plausible. Poverty support, in other words, would trickle up to vulture funds.Sanders takes a different approach. Instead of hoping for Medicaid and Earned Income Tax Credit funds at some future date, he'd implement them now. And instead of slashing local budgets, he'd create a new federal grant program for highways, trains, ferries, broadband, renewable energy and housing. Improving the basic services of the local economy, the thinking goes, would encourage private-sector investment.Republicans have resisted federal infrastructure spending for years, of course, and are unlikely to support Sanders' plan. Still, similarly ambitious initiatives have been successfully implemented in Puerto Rico. In the 1930s, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt supported an agency that pumped federal dollars into infrastructure investment in Puerto Rico, directed by local officials who understood the island's needs. Their plans helped eradicate malaria, tuberculosis and hookworm from the island, make electricity available to the island's interior and establish hurricane-proof construction using local manufacturing. Life expectancy significantly increased, according to research by Geoff Burrows, a Seton Hall University history professor.PROMESA promises not to spend any federal tax dollars on Puerto Rico. But sometimes, you have to spend money to make money.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-puerto-rico_n_575f4316e4b053d433061860,HuffPost,Liberal
208,Puerto Rico defaults on $422 million,Heather Long,5/2/16,"Puerto Rico is dialing 9-1-1 for any help it can get.  The island was unable to make a $422 million debt payment due Monday. It's another alarm bell of how bad the situation is getting on the island.    
 
  Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla calls it a ""humanitarian crisis,"" which a step above an economic emergency. He claims he is prioritizing paying Puerto Rico's police and teachers over Wall Street.   ""I had to make a choice. I decided that essential services for the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico came first,"" the governor said in a speech Sunday.   This is the  third time  the island has defaulted on bond payments. The island paid the interest due Monday, but not the principal amount, resulting in a default of about $370 million, Puerto Rico's largest yet.      Puerto Rico is $70 billion+ in debt    Puerto Rico is deep in debt. It owes over $70 billion to creditors. For months, Garcia Padilla has warned that Puerto Rico  doesn't have enough money  to pay its creditors.   Another huge payment is due July 1. The island's best hope is that Congress will act before then to provide some sort of relief, such as granting a temporary moratorium on payments until a plan can be worked out.   ""We're very far from the end,"" says Philip Fischer, the managing director of municipal bond research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""It's clear Congress doesn't know how to handle this.""     What will Congress do?    Congress is in the midst of finalizing an aid package for Puerto Rico. The big sticking point is whether there will be some sort of ""Oversight Board"" overseeing the island's finances for awhile, similar to the model used for Washington D.C. in the late 1990s.   Garcia Padilla and others on the island hate the current proposal. They argue Puerto Rico would lose its democratic rights if the Oversight Board can make decisions that supercede those of elected officials on the island.   The governor believes the solution is simple: Puerto Rico should be granted Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights -- or something similar -- to make it easier for the island to restructure some of its debts, akin to what Detroit did.   But many creditors and Republican lawmakers argue that the island has had years of political and financial mismanagement and needs someone from the outside to come in and restore credibility. The island still has not completed its 2014 audit, for example.   ""Congress has a Constitutional and financial responsibility to bring order to the chaos that is unfolding in the U.S. territory,"" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan  said  last month.   ""Legally, this is very complicated,"" says the long-time municipal bond expert Fischer, who is a lawyer himself.           What's next for Puerto Rico    The missed debt payment Monday is on bonds issued by the Government Development Bank, the economic development arm of the island's government. The big fear is that Puerto Rico will default on what is known as General Obligation debt in July.   Puerto Rico owes $1.9 billion on July 1.   ""Our resources are so scarce that we are struggling to pay the fuel supplier for the police patrol cars and emergency response vehicles,"" Governor Garcia Padilla says.    Puerto Rico's missed payments impact its own residents. Many retirees and savers are owners of the bonds. Wall Street hedge funds and other municipal bond funds hold the rest. But so far the overall U.S. bond market has not been negatively effected.   ""It's very serious, but the rest of the bond market is not expecting any contagion from it,"" says Fischer.

129,5 Things You Should Know As Puerto Rico Confronts Its Unpayable Debt,Daniel Marans,4/28/16,"Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank defaulted onmost of a $422 million debt payment that came due on Sunday, once again casting a spotlight on Congress's failure to address a spiraling debt crisis that has fueled the largestwave of emigration from the island in half a century. ""We've been forced to take emergency measures since Congress hasn't acted,""Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro García Padilla said Sunday night in a televised speech.The amount that was due Sunday accounts for just a small portion of the $70 billion debt burden that Puerto Rico’s government owes its external lenders. But defaulting on the payment will likely subject the island tomore lawsuits, even as Congress dilly-dallies on legislation that would give it some relief.Puerto Rico faces a July 1 deadline for a much larger debt servicepayment of roughly $2 billion. Here are five things you need to know about what's going on in Puerto Rico, how the situation got so bad and what the future holds.1. Puerto Rico’s financial crisis has taken a massive human toll.In recent years, Puerto Rico’s government has made increasingly drastic spending cuts and tax hikes in order to meet its obligations to creditors. The governmentlaid off tens of thousands of public employees and raised the sales tax from 7 percent to11.5 percent. It has closedsome 10 percent of Puerto Rico’s schools since 2014, driving a sharp rise in the size of classes. Even more schools are due for closure in the near future.The strains on public health infrastructure have made it more difficult for the island to combatan outbreak of the Zika virus.The relentless austerity has also stunted the island’s economy, while cutting back the very social services that are more needed than ever. Puerto Rico had an unemployment rate of11.8 percent in March -- more than twice the overall U.S. rate of 5 percent.The poverty rate on the island is now 45 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Puerto Ricans with the means to do so are leaving in droves for the mainland U.S., which their status as U.S. citizens makes a relatively simple move. Thelargest exodus in 50 years has resulted in a 9-percent drop in the island’s population, further eroding its tax base.2. The island's political status helped create the debt crisis.There are many reasons why Puerto Rico has racked up so many IOUs. It is true, as many conservatives claim, that consecutive governments deferred hard fiscal choices by continuing to issue bonds long after the island could no longer afford to take on more debt. Widespread official corruption and notoriously inefficient state-run utilities are a few of the other underlying challenges that Puerto Rico faces.But Puerto Rico’s unusual standing as a territory over which Congress enjoys extraordinary power may also have hindered its ability to achieve economic independence -- and thus pushed it to incur so much debt to fund public services.In 1976, Congress granted U.S. corporations a tax exemption for income earned in Puerto Rico (and other U.S. territories), prompting decades of economic growth on the island. When Congress passed another law in 1996 phasing out that exemption over 10 years, the island began an economic decline from which it has yet to recover.Puerto Rico also suffers from the effects of the Jones Act, an early 20th-century law that bars foreign-flagged ships from traveling from one U.S. port to another. Foreign-flagged ships must instead transfer their cargo to U.S.-flagged ships after arriving at the first U.S. port. With Puerto Rico often the second port of call, the law helps make consumer goods more expensive there than on the mainland.In addition, Medicare and Medicaid’s reimbursements to health care providers in Puerto Rico are a fraction of their mainland levels. Recent cuts as a result of the Affordable Care Act have lowered the Medicaid rate even further, reducing access to essential medical care for some of the island’s poorest residents. Sixty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans rely on one of the two programs for their health insurance, according to the Puerto Rico Health Care Crisis Coalition, an industry- and labor-backed alliance.3. That same status deprives Puerto Rico of a key economic tool.The island’s three main public utilities owe bondholders some $20 billion -- a significant slice of the total $70 billion debt. If Puerto Rico had the same bankruptcy powers that the 50 states enjoy, it could authorize those companies to go to court to reduce their debts. But federal law does not permit the island to extend bankruptcy protections to its municipalities and public corporations.In March, Puerto Rico presented a different legal interpretation to the Supreme Court, making the case that it can grant bankruptcy protections to its municipalities and public corporations. The high court is expected to announce a decision in the matter by late June.4. Hedge funds and other politically connected creditors are making the situation worse.A portion of Puerto Rico’s debt is held by hedge funds known as “vultures,” because of their ruthless pursuit of profit from impoverished debtor governments. The vulture funds appear to be using front groups to influence congressional debate on measures that could relieve Puerto Rican debt at the creditors' expense. 60 Plus, a conservative seniors' group that is funded by a few wealthy anonymous donors and played a lead role in opposing the Affordable Care Act, set up a group called ""Main Street Bondholders"" to fight efforts in Congress to provide Puerto Rico with even the most modest bankruptcy powers. While Main Street Bondholders claims to represent ordinary citizens invested in Puerto Rican debt, The New York Times reported that DCI, a public relations firm that specializes in faux grassroots campaigns, enlisted 60 Plus in the effort. BlueMountain Capital Management, a vulture hedge fund with major holdings of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority debt, is a client of DCI. BlueMountain, the Times noted, has also been one of the hedge funds most aggressively lobbying Congress against intervention on behalf of Puerto Rico in above-ground ways.Another organization, the Center for Individual Freedom, has been running television ads against the same legislative proposals. Although its donors are anonymous, CFIF is widely suspected of being a front for hedge funds that own Puerto Rican debt.5. Congress is dragging its feet.For a time it looked like congressional aid was finally on the way. After months of dithering as the crisis escalated, the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico unveiled a draft bill at the end of March that would give the island some very limited access to court-supervised debt restructuring in exchange for a Washington-based fiscal oversight board.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said passing an aid package was a priority. House Democrats, while critical of some aspects of the bill, said Republicans were negotiating in good faith and professed their commitment to finding an acceptable compromise. (Even then, not everybody was on board with the ""let's be positive"" approach: Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) immediately called for the bill to be defeated outright.)In mid-April, however, talks between the two parties reached an impasse with Democrats and Republicans involved in the process refusing to meet. Democrats wanted to weaken the fiscal oversight board, while Republicans in the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus expressed what appear to be more fundamental objections to the debt restructuring provisions.That makes the prospects of congressional action before May 1 virtually nonexistent. On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ramped up the pessimism when he voiced doubt that Congress would do anything before Puerto Rico’s next major debt repayment deadline on July 1.Puerto Rico owes its creditors $2 billion on that date, including more than $800 million in ""must pay"" general obligation bonds.This story has been updated to reflect Puerto Rico's default on most of the debt payment due May 1.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said BlueMountain Capital management had set up Main Street Bondholders. BlueMountain is a client of the PR firm that reportedly is behind Main Street Bondholders' efforts. The article also stated that BlueMountain holds general obligation debt; it holds municipal utility debt.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-may-deadline_n_57228dc8e4b0f309baf06905,HuffPost,Liberal
130,Hispanic Evangelicals: Puerto Rico Demands Action,"Gabriel Salguero, Contributor",4/27/16,"Over the next weeks, Congress will make critical decisions impacting 3.5 million American citizens -- the people of Puerto Rico.Mired in more than $70 billion in debt, Puerto Rico is cutting education, health care and law enforcement funding to pay its creditors. According to the religious development coalition Jubilee USA, nearly 60% of Puerto Rico's children live in poverty and 80% live in ""high-poverty areas,"" compared to just 11% on the US mainland. The only children's hospital on the island cut its budget 14%. The debt is simply not payable but without Congressional intervention, Puerto Rico is stuck in no-man's land - unable to access bankruptcy protection because it isn't a state and unable to get emergency loans from the IMF or World Bank because it isn't a country.In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus declares He has come to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, a reference to the Jubilee of the Hebrew Scriptures, a fifty-year cycle of debt forgiveness and liberation. In the Jubilee we see the Good News proclaimed in our economy, that God endowed us with a world of plenty to share with all of His children. Puerto Rico's crisis cries out for Jubilee. For solutions that lift up vulnerable families and children, that create holistic answers to problems rather than band-aids that will need to be re-applied every few years. The need for a Jubilee for Puerto Rico is dire.Nine Puerto Ricans leave the island every hour in search of a better life on the U.S. mainland. And one doctor leaves every day. They come to Florida, New York and Illinois, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. They leave behind brothers and sisters, husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers and friends. Puerto Rico's population declined by 10% over the past decade. The debt crisis is tearing Puerto Rico's communities apart.And yet faced with this catastrophe, Congress is blinking. Its members are being bombarded by misleading advertisements labeling any legislative solution ""a bailout."" Speaker Paul Ryan wanted legislation by March 31. Now the solution may drag into May, when Puerto Rico will miss another debt payment and slide further into the abyss. The next two weeks are critical. The Hispanic evangelicals of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition urge action now. Inaction will seep millions into deeper despair.There are two important ways we can help.1. Puerto Rico's religious community and religious leaders have been heroic in their efforts to end this crisis. Led by San Juan Archbishop Roberto González Nieves and Bible Society head Reverend Heriberto Martínez Rivera, the leaders are asking us to pray with them for Congress. You can sign up to pray and get involved here.2. This Wednesday, Jubilee USA is organizing tens of thousands of Americans to call Congress and urge lawmakers to pass a bill that gives Puerto Rico the tools it needs to restructure its debt, reduces child poverty and protects Puerto Rican democracy.

In rare bays around the world, the right set of factors -- low circulation, shallow depth, high temperatures, and nutrient-saturated waters -- combine to create the perfect conditions for the proliferation of amazing little creatures called dinoflagellates. Those are the strange little guys you see above (it's notoriously difficult to capture the bioluminescence with a camera). When agitated, they release a spark of blue light, creating constellations of stars in the lagoon's dark waters. Puerto Rico goes to great lengths to protect these unique ecosystems, but the fragile bays likely won't be around forever. This is an absolute must-see.What to do there: The best way to visit the Bioluminescent Bay is on a kayaking tour, which run nightly except when there's a full or almost-full moon.

132,Puerto Rico: 6 Things You Should Know Before Visiting,"Brenda Mejia, Contributor",4/13/16,"There are things that are not told by any tourism board when you are visiting a new country. Even though those things are easy to find online or in travel guides if we just take a look. Writing this does not make me happy. I must admit I am feeling a mixed of ashamed, embarrassed and pissed from listening to all the negative news stories that involve tourists. The first two feelings don't need that much explanation. For years, Puerto Ricans have been known for being ""warm people with huge hearts"" unless they are driving a car. Definitely as a Puerto Rican, I feel kinda embarrassed from knowing that we are showing our worst face to our visitors. It is a shame. But, why does this piss me off? Because I believe there are many things that could be avoided by just making a proper Google search.Here is my contribution to this matter. These are things I believe you need to know if you are visiting Puerto Rico:1. NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS ENGLISHNo, being part of the States does not make us magically bilingual. This is an island with 400 years of history previous to the U.S. presence. Of course, there are a few people who are totally fluent and will make you feel in a less awkward situation. But please: don't expect everyone to be fluent and do not get mad if someone doesn't speak English. One of the differences between a traveler and a tourist is that travelers tend to understand that locals are people just like them, and will make an effort to at least be thankful in the local language of the place they are visiting. Most of the tourists believe locals are there to serve them. Don't be a tourist in that matter.2. If there are no locals walking by that area, why would you?The other day a group of tourists got robbed in Condado (Link in Spanish). Condado is a widely known tourist area with amazing beaches and hotels, which is located right in the heart of San Juan. Crime these days is becoming more common in that area, and who are they looking for? Visitors, tourists. How to avoid it? This is more about common sense. Try not to bring your valuables out at any time and try to be aware of your surroundings. It may happen at any time of the day, but it increases at night.The other one was robbed in Santurce, in an area that you won't see many locals walking around. If you don't see locals there that much, try to avoid the area, and even more in nighttime. The area where they were walking is between a popular hostel and Wal-Mart! Try to get your groceries during daytime. If you're planning to go out, it is better to call a cab.3. When visiting El Yunque, DON'T GO AWAY FROM THE PATH.Getting lost in El Yunque seems like some sort of a tourist hobby, but no, it's not even funny. Some have died, others had better luck. A week ago, a Swedish couple spent more than 20 hours lost there. They were found and they were fined for using a forbidden path. They even called 911, but did not remain in one place while the authorities were looking for them, which made their rescue harder. Is that using common sense?A few days ago, that same thing happened with seven tourists. The moral of this story is not by any means that you should not visit El Yunque, but please, read the signs and walk using a path where you see other hikers. It's not common to hear that a local got lost there, but tourists getting lost is almost becoming a cliché -- like getting naked in Machu Pichu.I will be a little harsh at this point, but keep in mind: You are visiting an island that is suffering its worst economic crisis in history. Rescuing someone definitely costs money to the state and to the people of this country. I suggest you use your gut instincts while going out to hike.  4. Public transportation is basically NON-EXISTENTLook at it! Is like looking at a magic creature!Don't even ask about Uber. You don't want to go there. Uber is not available here. Getting around the island might be your biggest expense. My three recommendations are: Rent a car -- It will be really expensive, but you'll have control over where you're going. The negative side? People on this island drive like crazy, so you must be VERY careful.Taxi -- The prices are ridiculously expensive for short distances, so only use them when needed. My best advice:5. Make friends with locals!This is the best thing you could do to experience the island. Having a local friend will help you with any language barrier, especially during those times when people try to take advantage of you just because you don't speak Spanish. Your local friend will also be there to show you those hidden gems outside the tourist areas in safer ways. Also, a local friend will help you with transportation issues around the island. Definitely this is your best option to move around the island.6. This is not the place to hitch hikeAs I told you before, if there are no locals walking around, most likely, it is a dangerous area. If you try to hitch hike, probably you will be ignored. People tend to be scared of bringing someone they haven't previously met in their cars. Back to the previous point: Meet locals online before your trip.This is not by any mean a ""don't visit Puerto Rico"" article. I'm just warning so you will be able to enjoy it responsibly and be conscious of different situations you may encounter while visiting. I want you to see the best from our island, and definitely to make you feel comfortable while you are experiencing your dream vacation!If you want to know tips to enjoy your visit to Puerto Rico, check my post for Thrifty Travel.For travel tips and other stories, visit Traveleira",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-6-things-you_b_9646680,HuffPost,Liberal
209,Puerto Rico is losing a doctor a day,Heather Long,4/13/16,"Puerto Rico is losing a doctor a day.  Justin Maldonado learned that fact in the most tragic way possible.    
 
  His uncle had a stroke in the summer of 2014. The family rushed him to a local hospital in Coamo. The emergency room doctors recommended that his uncle be taken immediately to a neurologist.   Then the Maldonado family was told only two neurologists were on duty for an entire island of 3.5 million people. It was a holiday weekend.     His uncle died several days later.   ""Don't get hurt in Puerto Rico, especially on a holiday or a Sunday,"" says Maldonado. Occasionally, he drives by the hospital where his uncle died. There are always people waiting. The family has taken to calling the lines ""the walking dead.""    In 2014, 364 doctors left the island never to return, the Puerto Rican Surgeons and Physicians Association says. Last year, 500 doctors packed up. Most moved for more lucrative positions in the mainland U.S.   The island is in a financial crisis of its own -- it doesn't have enough money to pay back over  $70 billion in debt . On Wednesday, the House Committee on Natural Resources is holding another hearing to determine what to do. There's been a lot of attention on whether to allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy (or  something like it ).   But the deeper problem is that the island has been in an economic crisis for a decade. That's why doctors -- and other professionals -- are fleeing. Puerto Rico has lost over 10% of its population in the past decade. Jobs just aren't there and  home values are plummeting .   On top of that, Medicare reimburses doctors far less in Puerto Rico than other states.    ""I have a hard time recruiting. We can't compete with institutions in the U.S.,"" says Dr. Fernando Luis Joglar. He's a vascular surgeon and president of the American College of Surgeons Puerto Rico Chapter.   He gets offers all the time from hospitals in the mainland United States. Many come via letter or postcard. His wife leaves them out on the kitchen table for him to see when he arrives home.   She doesn't even have to say it out loud, why are they still in Puerto Rico?   For Dr. Joglar, it's because his family is there and he worries what will happen if he leaves. His specialty is a lot like neurology. There are only a handful of vascular surgeons left who operate on veins and arteries. If he goes, he believes corpses will pile up.   ""The recession is getting worse. It's effecting private hospitals. They're closing,"" says Dr. Joglar.    Congress has promised to take some sort of action to aid the island in its time of crisis, likely before a huge debt payment is due to creditors in July. There's a push to give Puerto Rico more federal Medicare and Medicaid funding in the final bill. But the initial "" discussion draft "" legislation didn't include any additional health care money.   Governor Alejandro García Padilla has gone as far as to declare a ""humanitarian crisis"" on the island. His office notes that Puerto Rico ""receives less than half the federal healthcare funding of any of the 50 states."" The  Zika virus outbreak  has only stressed the island's medical system further.   ""If they don't stop the bleeding now, this is going to get super ugly by the end of the year,"" says Maldonado. He's trying to convince his 80-year-old mother to move back to New York City with him.

133,Puerto Rico Activists Crash Federal Reserve Panel With Creative Protest,Ben Walsh,4/7/16,"NEW YORK -- Over a dozen activists descended on a building where Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and her three living predecessors were speaking on Thursday to demand that the Fed bail out Puerto Rico’s cash-strapped government. The demonstrators, who are affiliated with the progressive Fed Up coalition, distributed Puerto Rican flags and empanadas as Puerto Rican music played outside Manhattan’s International House, a student residence. Yellen was there for an unprecedented panel discussion alongside past Fed chairs Ben Bernanke, Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, who participated via videostream.The activists were joined by Puerto Rican lawmaker Manuel Natal, who was in town to participate in a panel discussion hosted by City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito on Friday.""They have two mechanisms under their authority to help Puerto Rico: one is to provide a bailout to Puerto Rico similar to the one they did to banks, the same banks that are now in Puerto Rico making a fortune out of our fiscal situation,"" Natal said. ""And the second would be to buy our debt"" and charge Puerto Rico interest rates that are lower than the market would offer.The activists claim that since the Fed had the authority to buy trillions of dollars of bad debt from Wall Street banks after the 2008 financial crisis, it can do the same for the debt of Puerto Rico.Economic observers with knowledge of the Fed’s functions consider that argument dubious. Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an economist at the Fed Board of Governors for many years, said that the Fed is not allowed to buy municipal debt -- of the kind Puerto Rico owes -- that comes due over a period longer than six months. He also said such a purchase would be inconsistent with the Fed’s dual mandate of maintaining price stability and full employment. The Fed has “never bailed out any insolvent entity as far as I know. They always demand collateral sufficient to cover any loan,” Gagnon said, as the Fed did when it provided aid to major U.S. banks.Natal, the lawmaker, also believes some of Puerto Rico's debt has been issued unconstitutionally and can therefore be nullified. Greg Williams, a spokesman for Jubilee USA, a coalition of faith-based groups that advocates for global debt relief policies, declined to endorse a Fed bailout, but suggested the Fed could broker a deal instead.“We support a proposal where the Fed facilitates a restructuring process,” Williams said.More important than the details of the demonstrators’ demands, however, is the protest’s political symbolism in the midst of a heated battle over Puerto Rico’s future. The demonstration was perhaps the most colorful in a series of political moves and counter-moves by the Puerto Rican government and its sympathizers on one hand and the commonwealth’s bondholders and their allies on the other. Both seek to influence a congressional rescue plan that could enable Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.Members of Congress from both parties are negotiating changes to the draft of a relief bill released last week by the House Committee on Natural Resources, which has jurisdiction over U.S. territories.But many in Puerto Rico, and some progressives in the mainland United States, object to the Washington-based federal oversight board the bill would introduce to audit Puerto Rico’s finances and recommend reforms. Under the terms of the bill, Puerto Rico would pursue voluntary compromises with its creditors; failing that, the board could greenlight court-supervised debt restructuring that would force bondholders to accept the losses.Those critics of the draft bill -- including lawmaker Natal -- view the board as having the trappings of American colonial rule over Puerto Rico.They also argue that Puerto Rico should not have to meet any conditions to gain access to court-supervised debt restructuring. Puerto Rico, unlike the fifty mainland states, lacks the power to grant its municipalities and public corporations federal bankruptcy protections.Puerto Rico is taking a multi-pronged approach to secure debt relief that appears designed to increase its leverage with creditors and win terms that are as favorable as possible. The island’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, signed a bill on Wednesday that would empower him to declare a state of emergency and enact a moratorium on the island’s $70 billion debt. Puerto Rico’s next major debt payment -- a $422 million tranche -- comes due on May 1.Daniel Hanson, a Puerto Rico specialist for the financial analysis firm The Height, wrote in an email newsletter that Puerto Rico’s creditors will likely challenge the moratorium in court, where Puerto Rico’s “playbook is not likely to be persuasive to American courts adjudicating the contracted rights of creditors.""Garcia Padilla has said the island is incapable of paying its debts in full. Puerto Rico has enacted spending cuts and tax hikes in recent years that have stifled its economy and depleted its social services, creating a situation that many people already characterize as a humanitarian crisis.Puerto Rico also argued for the right to enforce a local bankruptcy law that went before the Supreme Court last month after lower courts had blocked the island from putting it into effect. The high court is expected to rule in the case by late June.In Congress, Democrats sensitive to Puerto Rico’s plight -- and solicitous of the votes of former island residents living on the mainland -- hope to dilute some of the proposed oversight board’s sweeping powers.The Height’s Hanson, however, expects subsequent iterations of the House bill to be “more creditor-friendly,” he wrote.Meanwhile, organizations representing Puerto Rico’s powerful creditors have stepped up their efforts to amend the legislation to limit the restructuring authority that the island would get. The commonwealth’s bondholders include a significant number of so-called vulture funds, which are hedge funds that have bought its debt from other creditors at discounted rates on the promise of recovering the obligations’ original full-dollar value.A group called Main Street Bondholders, which claims to represent ordinary retirees, has created a web site attacking the draft House bill for granting Puerto Rico “super Chapter 9” bankruptcy protections.Main Street Bondholders is associated with the conservative seniors group 60 Plus, which played an active role in the fight against the Affordable Care Act. The New York Times reported in December that 60 Plus is funded by a handful of large, anonymous donors and was recruited into the effort by a Republican public relations firm that also represents BlueMountain Capital, a creditor that has been outspoken against federal government help for the island.The fight over whether to help Puerto Rico has reached the bottom rung of American discourse -- cable news ads paid for by undisclosed donors. The ad, which ran on CNN and was paid for by the Center for Individual Freedom, urges Congress to “stop the Washington bailout of Puerto Rico.” The Virginia-based conservative group does not disclose its donors. It was founded in 1998 to combat government restrictions on smoking.The CFIF did not respond to a Huffington Post question about whether any of its funders have a financial stake in the outcome of the Puerto Rico bailout.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-activists-federal-reserve_n_5706cb81e4b0a506064eae19,HuffPost,Liberal
134,Puerto Rico's Problems Shouldn't Be Solved By Selling Public Lands,"Will  Rogers, Contributor",4/6/16,"In recent weeks, there have been a number of proposals to help the commonwealth of Puerto Rico deal with its enormous debt, which is $72 billion and growing, and which has caused major economic headaches for the island.But any action taken by Congress shouldn't involve selling off parts of Vieques National Wildlife Refuge, which is one of the ideas in a bill proposed recently in the House of Representatives. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell recently made her first trip to Puerto Rico and declared that ""we need to be very, very careful...Giving up public lands or natural areas to development is not synonymous with economic growth and development."" She added ""this is a beautiful place with tremendous natural resources, cultural resources, historic resources...""The Secretary is correct, and the proposal to permit development in the refuge should be dropped from any measure Congress eventually adopts. While Puerto Rico's financial problems are very serious and need to be addressed, permitting development of our public lands should not be part of any solution. Vieques is a unique place. In 1941, as World War II began, the U.S. Navy took it over and used it for gunnery practice by ships at the nearby Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. But when that base was closed, Vieques was no longer needed, the Navy left the island in 2003 and most it was turned into a National Wildlife Refuge. It has quickly become one of the Caribbean's top tourist spots and was recently voted by the public as the fourth best of the nation's more than 560 refuges.While Puerto Rico certainly has many challenges, it also has some of the best beaches and most spectacular natural habit in the Caribbean, which is why The Trust for Public Land has worked on the island for years. Just east of San Juan's touristy Condado beaches, we protected the most important sea turtle habitat in the Caribbean. And on the island's southwest corner, we helped protect land at the Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge. In recent months, there has been much attention in the media about proposals to sell or turn over to the states some of our public lands. But what critics of public lands don't understand is that the ""public"" in that discussion is all of us. Together, we jointly own all those lands, whether they are located in America's national parks, or the wildlife refuges in Puerto Rico and other places. Our public lands are the envy of the world, and people visit them from all over the globe. In fact, the federal agencies which oversee those lands on our behalf have developed international offices to help other nations protect their own lands. Rather than proposing to sell off wildlife refuges for short-term gains, our leaders and legislators at all levels should be thinking about how to protect them for the long term, so our children and grandchildren can visit them.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-ricos-problems-shouldnt_b_9621110,HuffPost,Liberal
135,These Charts Show Just How Much Puerto Rico Is Shrinking,Daniel Marans,3/26/16,"The Obama administration has made the mass departure of people from Puerto Rico a central part of its pleas for congressional action to help the commonwealth, warning that the out-migration is worsening the island’s crippling debt crisis by depleting its tax base. Since most departing Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, move to the United States mainland and lean Democratic, the warnings carry a subtext for immigration-wary Republicans: Act now to help the island, or face the political fallout later.A new report released on Thursday provides new insight into the acuteness of the crisis. ThePew Research Center analysis of the latest county-level census data shows just how much the faltering economy and accompanying exodus have drained the island of its people, painting a bleak picture that can only add urgency to efforts underway in Congress.Puerto Rico’s population was 3.47 million in 2015 -- 9 percent, or 334,000 people, smaller than it was in 2000, according to Pew.Not surprisingly, the lion’s share of the drop -- some three-quarters -- occurred from 2010 to 2015, as the island’s troubles mounted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Pew created an animated graphic comparing Puerto Rico's growth in previous decades with the recent decline and illustrating where declines have been largest. San Juan, the island's capital city, has been hit hardest, losing 10 percent of its population, or 40,000 people, since 2000.Pew points to Puerto Rico’s prolonged economic malaise as the primary culprit for its shrinking population. Economic opportunity, according to census data cited by the study, is the main reason Puerto Ricans give for moving to the mainland U.S.But the report also notes another byproduct of the poor economy: It has depressed the fertility rate, making it less likely that people who stay on the island will replace the people who leave.Puerto Rico has dramatically raised taxes and cut spending in recent years to pay down a debt burden of over $70 billion, which the island’s government says it will never be able to pay in full. The effect of the austerity has been to both severely limit the ability of the island's economy to recover -- it has an 11.7 percent unemployment rate, more than twice that of the mainland U.S. -- and hollow out key social services, like health care and education.That is one reason the White House has said that “without congressional action the situation [in Puerto Rico] could soon become a humanitarian crisis” -- even as other observers, like Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), say that crisis has already arrived.And the island could soon face new legal troubles, if, as many expect, it is unable to make bond payments to creditors due in a few weeks.Puerto Rico needs help from Congress because as a U.S. commonwealth it occupies a gray zone that has deprived it of many of the economic liberties available to states. Chief among those is the ability to extend federal Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections to municipalities. Puerto Rico’s government says that without the ability to restructure its debts in a judicially supervised process, it will never be able to recover economically. The commonwealth argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it has the right to pass local bankruptcy laws in the absence of federal protections. If the court rules in the island’s favor, it would allow Puerto Rico to reduce the amount its municipal utilities owe, which, at $20 billion, is only a fraction of its overall debts. A decision in the case is expected by the end of June.Regardless of how the high court rules, however, aid for the island may soon be on its way. House Republicans are hard at work on legislation that would open the door for the island to restructure debts in exchange for financial reforms overseen by a Washington-based fiscal oversight board. House Democrats have said they believe their colleagues are negotiating in good faith.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charts-puerto-rico-shrinking_n_56f6db62e4b0a372181a21b0,HuffPost,Liberal
136,The Supreme Court Could Throw A Lifeline To Debt-Swamped Puerto Rico,Daniel Marans,3/22/16,"WASHINGTON -- Puerto Rico had a good day, or at least a hopeful one, in court on Tuesday.The Supreme Court seemed receptive to Puerto Rico’s argument that it has the power to enact bankruptcy protections for its public entities, including its cash-strapped utilities. The sympathetic hearing suggests thefinancially beleaguered commonwealth may gain one more tool, however modest, in its efforts to reduce a debt burden of over $70 billion.There's another factor that may weigh in Puerto Rico's favor: The case is being heard by a Supreme Court in which the liberals outnumber the conservatives. The currently eight-member court lost one more judge when Justice Samuel Alito recused himself -- possibly because he and/or his wife have investments in a fund that is a major holder of Puerto Rican utility company debt.And the liberals clearly dominated the hearing. With the exception of a few questions from Chief Justice John Roberts, the three conservative justices on the bench did not speak at all.The dispute centers on the Recovery Act, a 2014 Puerto Rico law that aimed to create a special bankruptcy process for certain public corporations, including the island's three main public utilities. Those utilities owe a combined $20 billion. The largest, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, owes $9 billion just by itself.The ability to restructure their debt would benefit those companies -- and possibly their customers, the residents of Puerto Rico -- but their creditors would face significant losses. That concern drove a group of major creditors to sue to stop the law from taking effect.BlueMountain Capital Management and funds managed by Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds successfully argued in the lower courts that federal bankruptcy law’s pre-emption of state law applies to Puerto Rican law as well. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code prohibits states from establishing their own bankruptcy laws that would “bind a creditor that does not consent.”Critically for this case, however, the states do have the ability to extend federal bankruptcy protections under Chapter 9 to their municipalities -- that is, cities, towns, school districts, municipal utilities, etc. Puerto Rico contends that it is not subject to the overall prohibition on enacting state bankruptcy protections because it's not a state. It points to a 1984 federal law, which denies the commonwealth the ability to let its municipalities seek Chapter 9 protection -- the very ability that states have. If Puerto Rico is not a ""state"" there, the argument goes, then it's not a state for the rest of Chapter 9 -- which happens to include the provision preventing states from writing their own binding bankruptcy laws.The creditors counter that Chapter 1 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code clearly establishes that the term “‘State’ includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.” Thus, while Puerto Rico is not a state for purposes of defining when its municipalities ""may be a debtor,"" the creditors argue that federal law still considers it a state when it comes to prohibiting states from writing their own bankruptcy laws.On Tuesday, Puerto Rico’s lead attorney, Christopher Landau, insisted that a state's ""only role"" under Chapter 9 is to extend bankruptcy protections to municipalities. Therefore, he said, the exception laid out in Chapter 1 is “just another way of saying Puerto Rico is outside the scope of Chapter 9” entirely.The liberal justices initially seemed skeptical of that interpretation.At one point, under persistent questioning from Justice Stephen Breyer, Landau reminded Breyer that the justice has “always been sensitive"" to the kind of argument he was making.“That may be, but I can't say that an ‘airplane’ means a horse,” Breyer interjected, prompting laughter throughout the chamber.But as the time wore on, Breyer and his Democratic-appointed fellows seemed to find Landau’s arguments more compelling.Justice Elena Kagan noted more than once that while she had not initially been persuaded by Puerto Rico's case, Landau's elucidation at oral argument helped her to understand it.Kagan pressed the creditors' lawyer, Matthew McGill, to rebut Puerto Rico’s point -- which she described as “once you're not eligible for Chapter 9, none of the provisions of Chapter 9 apply to you.”“The fundamental fallacy of the argument is that the 'gateway' requirement [that an entity be a state in order to extend Chapter 9 protections] somehow excludes you from the scope of Chapter 9 entirely,” McGill said.Breyer was not satisfied with that response, suggesting that it does not require one to “play games with words” to see that Chapter 9 is directed at those entities that have the power to utilize federal bankruptcy protections -- which is to say, states.Although everybody seemed to agree that Congress’ intentions in passing that 1984 law were murky at best, the liberal justices appeared to find it curious that Congress would have deliberately left Puerto Rico without any method for discharging government debts, short of an act of Congress.“Why would Congress put Puerto Rico in this never­-never land”? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked.The elephant in the room was the Puerto Rican financial and economic crisis, which grows more severe by the day. The Puerto Rican government has maintained that the commonwealth cannot pay its debts and that it is reaching the limits of what it can reasonably ask its people to sacrifice. It has already resorted to austerity measures in the form of spending cuts and tax increases, which have effectively left the island stuck in a prolonged recession.As a result, Puerto Rico has been experiencing population loss since 2005, including a net migration of 64,000 people to the U.S. mainland in 2014 alone. The Treasury Department estimates that the island's 3.5 million population has declined 10 percent in the past decade.This is the second time this year that Puerto Rico, represented by Landau, has pleaded for the Supreme Court to recognize its right to decide something for itself. The island has apparently placed its hopes for relief in the judiciary after years of requests for congressional action went unanswered.The Obama administration is still pushing Congress for legislation that would grant Puerto Rico power to restructure its debts and establish a financial oversight board to ensure the commonwealth makes fiscal reforms. The Treasury Department has argued that extending Chapter 9 authority would not be enough, since it would allow the island to restructure only $20 billion out of its $70 billion debt.A bill being drafted by House Republicans would create somewhat stricter hurdles for restructuring than the White House has set forth and ultimately would leave those decisions to the discretion of the oversight board.Landau used the final portion of his argument time on Tuesday to remind the justices that “this is also a flesh-­and­-blood situation in Puerto Rico.”“To say that [the law] precludes Puerto Rico from dealing in any way with the financial crisis for its public utilities, which … provide basic services like electricity and water to its people -- that's the question: whether people in a village in Puerto Rico will be able to get clean water,” he said.A decision in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust is expected sometime before the end of June.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-puerto-rico-bankruptcy_n_56f1b5c1e4b0c3ef5217219a,HuffPost,Liberal
210,Puerto Rico has become 'dead dog island',Heather Long,3/20/16,"Leopoldina Roubian feels like her phone rings as often as a 911 emergency call center.  She and her friends rescued over 1,100 abandoned animals in Puerto Rico last year, mostly dogs.    
 
  People leave animals in boxes on her doorstep. They call her when they see stray dogs, who are all over -- on beaches, in parks and by the roadside. And then there are the puppies left to die in vacant houses or dumpsters.   ""This last year has been horrible,"" says Roubian, known to most as ""Leo"" or just ""dog lady.""   Many animal lovers have heard of Puerto Rico's "" dead dog beach ,"" a stretch of sand and jungle on the island's southeastern side where people dump their dogs. But the truth is Puerto Rico has become ""dead dog island,"" Roubian says.            The financial crisis has made it worse    The problem is getting worse as Puerto Rico's  economic crisis  deepens. Roubian never leaves home without pet food because she finds strays daily. Her property has become a makeshift shelter. She lives with over 20 dogs and sometimes pigs, cats and horses too.   No one knows exactly how many strays Puerto Rico has, but a 2010 documentary about the plight is called "" 100,000 "" for a reason.   ""If people care, they dump the dog in areas like Rincon [a popular surfing town] where people and tourists are around,"" says Roubian. But many don't care -- or don't have the money to care. They leave dogs by the road or in the trash.      Puppies left in a box in Rincon, Puerto Rico.        People who flee the island...leave their dogs    People are literally  fleeing Puerto Rico  because the island's economy is so bad. One in 10 people is out of work. The island's government has run out of money and is  $72 billion in debt .   Over 10% of the population has booked a one-way ticket out (mostly to Florida, Texas and elsewhere in the mainland U.S.) in the past decade. Sometimes people just  leave their homes  and lock their dogs inside, never to return.    Volunteers say the island's no-kill shelters are full and that animals taken to many facilities are put down. That's why nonprofits such as  Barks of Hope  (which Roubian spearheads) and her partners  ARF  (Animal Rescue Foundation) and  Defensa Animal de Rincón  try so hard to rescue animals first.     Machismo culture makes the dog problem worse    Roubian is a fairy godmother to Puerto Rican animals. But she has tough love for humans who don't care for their pets.   ""Your dog is beautiful. Why does it have balls?"" she frequently asks people on the streets.   Part of the reason the dog crisis is so bad is that Puerto Ricans don't spay or neuter their dogs. It's a machismo thing. Puerto Rican men don't want to cut off a dog's manhood. The trouble is when dogs get abandoned on the streets, they breed and breed and breed.   ""Puerto Rico has so many problems,"" laments Ivette Cruzado, an engineer and professor who spends her spare time volunteering with ARF in the surf city of Rincon. ""This is a stubborn culture.""          Not enough veterinarians in Puerto Rico    The government is also at fault, volunteers say.   Veterinarians are willing to come help -- for free. They offer to treat and neuter strays, but technically, they are forbidden from operating under Puerto Rican law.   The vets would need a license issued by a Puerto Rican board. The process is cumbersome and there are  no longer any veterinary schools  on the island.   ""Maybe they think it would take business away from Puerto Rican doctors, but these animals aren't going to any vets at all,"" says Denise Gilbert, who moved to Rincon, Puerto Rico with her family several years ago. She has adopted 12 dogs and 15 cats.   A simple stroke of a pen by the Puerto Rican government to accept veterinary licenses from other U.S. states or grant temporary permits to visiting doctors could make a big difference, Gilbert says.   Former governors -- both liberal and conservative -- told CNNMoney they were aware of the problem but it fell to the bottom of the ""to do"" list. The current government has made some efforts  to partner with the Humane Society , but the problem is vast.     Dogs fly from Puerto Rico to New York    As word has spread about Puerto Rico's stray dogs -- including many pure bred Shih Tzu and Maltese -- people in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere have started to step up and  adopt the animals . Or just get the animals to no-kill shelters.   Volunteers like Roubian and Gilbert often wake up at 3 a.m. to drive dogs to the San Juan airport on the other side of the island so they can board morning flights to New York.    American Airlines   ( AAL )  flies dogs under 50 pounds to New York and other locations for about $50 to $80, a dramatically reduced rate.   Many American Airlines workers have embraced the cause. They clean the kennels the dogs are transported in and return them to the Puerto Rican volunteers so they can be used again.   Volunteers wish other airlines like  United   ( UAL )  and  JetBlue   ( JBLU )  that fly those routes would offer discounts as well. United and JetBlue didn't respond to CNNMoney's request for comment for this article.     How to resolve the crisis    CNNMoney spoke with numerous volunteers in Puerto Rico who rescue animals. All of them had a similar wishlist, primarily made up of three things:      More families  willing to adopt  the animals   A requirement for Puerto Ricans to neuter their dogs   The Puerto Rican government to  lift its restriction  on veterinary licenses  Roubian's average veterinary bill is around $5,000 a month. She never turns away animals, but she dreams of the day when this crisis ends and she gets happy phone calls again.   ""I don't know what it is about Puerto Rican dogs, but they are the best,"" Roubian says as her latest adopted pup, a Chihuahua, licks her face.    If you are interested in adopting a Puerto Rican dog or supporting the rescue efforts, you can learn more about  Barks of Hope here ,  Defensa Animal  here  or  Animal Rescue Foundation here . These three groups partner together.

137,How to Indulge in the Many Personalities of Puerto Rico,"Richard Bangs, Contributor",3/13/16,"Puerto Rico is a portmanteaux of geographic personalities, an overstuffed valise of seductive charismas and tropic endowments. If geography is destiny, then Puerto Rico atones for the ill-tempers of other parts of the world, and instead is blessed with an island-wide jocund, incited, in part, by its natural features...its mountains, forests, beaches, rivers, lakes, cliffs, caves, and all between. I've been to Puerto Rico many times, and each time I step off the plane I breathe deep. The very air seems to be made of a different and sweeter substance. But in my travels, I've noticed that each of the five major geographic regions offer up distinctive qualities and dispositions. They are, of course, bound together by a common pride and gladness for their shared ship, but they are also quite different, and each is worth visiting for its inimitability and exceptional assets.So, I decided to parse it, and share my take on the extraordinary cast and temperament of these regions. Each is a country onto its own, and so very worth the time to explore.1) The SouthStarting from the Hilton Condado in San Juan it's a mellow 90 minutes drive to Ponce, named, some say, after Ponce de Leon, who sought gold and eternal youth here.There is an elegant European flavor to the south of Puerto Rico, harking back to when its port was the busiest in the island. It was sugar that made fortunes for the early European landowners, and allowed a flourishing of art and architecture, and an eclectic melding of Caribbean and neo-classical styles.Ponce, the Pearl of the South, is aunrhym graceful grande dame of a city, built for awe and bliss, and timelessness. Here dreams were drawn, and then realized. Every building, every curve, every line, showcases a cultivated, enriched heart. There is beauty and meaning in every bite of the chisel.Here is the architecture of happiness. It is art we can walk through. Design that makes us content; bellyfuls of colors to gulp.It is the creation of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, and stimulates the people it serves. It makes us dance. It speaks to us of a degree of serenity, strength, poise and grace we seek everywhere, but find here. Every brick seems alive, unruly and individual; every plank has the pulse of nature flowing through it. The space between is the breath of art.Where can we find greater structural clarity than in the buildings in the South of Puerto Rico? Where else can we find such unity of material, construction and form? Here the wisdom and joy of diverse cultures is stored. What feelings for material and what power of expression there is in these structures! What warmth and beauty they have! They are the echoes of the men and women who first made this port their landing, and their home. And now the romance and passion of their creations is ours, here in the South of Puerto Rico.2) The EastHow does it happen that the whole family comes together? How does it happen that tropical birds sing, that clear water flows, that the orchids unfold, that the dawn whitens behind the virgin forest on the quivering summit of El Yunque? A trip to the East of Puerto Rico, and all is said and done.For families, this is the most amazing place, for the leaping greenly spirits of the rainforest, and for the blue dream of sky, and for everything that is natural, that is infinite, that is yes.Parents can never have enough of the freedom children are gifted here. Mothers and fathers are refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor; the safety and welfare in the wild as well as the resort; the sea-coast with its adventures, the wilderness with its vines and flowers, even the rain, which plays like a band. There is always music amongst the trees here.The East emanates a subtle, precious light, day and night, demonstrating the unsurpassed truth that this is a playground for children of all ages. This is a place that enables happiness...and a happy family is but an earlier heaven.The East is the acreage of a rainbow, the portal to grasping the mystery that breathes behind things. It is the wondrous garden with trails that wind like helixes, with broad beaches and vibrant birds, with bioluminescence and the self-propelled flowers called butterflies. There are so many ways to share this bounty of the treasured island, from kayaking to paddle boarding, horseback riding to golf, tennis, fishing and swimming, from sumptuous meals, to the laughter-filled water parks. Here families are unrhymed poetry, stanzas of sand, sun and sea. Here they find a freshness and candor in their clan. They strengthen bonds, like the ever-thickening vines in the rain forests.Why does a child on a water slide wave at his parents every time he splashes down - and why do his parents always wave back? It all becomes evident here, in the East of Puerto Rico.3) The NorthThe North of Puerto Rico is like the monkey who locked upthe zookeeper. It has put away the constrained thinking that keeps others stuckin unproductive routines, and allowed its wildness to escape the margins.Because it's faithful to our childlike imaginations of wilderness, our youthfulnotions of life authentic and unadulterated, the North remains a true, originaladventure. Here we can remember what makes life rip-roaring and breathtaking.We can test our mettle, hear our hearts race, and even encounter a bit ofdanger. This is a world painted in bold, unrepentant strokes: whereparrots and kingfishers swoop over waterfalls, and the rushing water of a lifewell-lived can splash you in the face.Let's look at some of the elements that make up The North:Style. Style is the perfection of a point of view, and whatviews there are here, cliffs that cast off to infinity; mountains that scratchthe sky. Golf courses so green and perfect they seem expressions ofimagination. Everywhere there is color, there is fashion, there is coherence,there is style. If James Bond vacationed, he would come here.Adventure. Every turn here reveals a story. Every step adiscovery. Here you can ride a horse on trails to lordly views; you can dancein public; you can spelunk through some of the world's largest cave networks,and float on underground rivers; you can be a bird on a wire, and zipline overravines and streams. Leave the ordinary behind; the adventure of life beginshere. Play. You can sift the fine sand in your fingers and toes;you can hike the lush forests and parks; you can skip rocks in theshimmering lakes; you can swim, dive, sail and dine. Play till the suncomes down, and then play some more.Luxury. No need to set an alarm here; you can sleep in. Youcan indulge in fine cottons and linen; you can spoil yourself with spas andbaths; you can treat yourself to the finest wines and cuisine. Pamper yourselfwith exquisite, attentive, personalized service. You can relax, refresh andrevive, and undertake the noble art of leaving things undone.Beauty, spirit, freedom, comfort and poise...these are hallmarks ofthe North of Puerto Rico.4) The WestTo stand at the edge of the sea; to sense the ebb and flow of the tides; to feel the breath of moving water, to watch the flight of shorebirds, is to have knowledge of things nearly eternal as any earthly life can be. This is a place that whispers to the soul, imploring mind and body to relax, to let go and be at peace again. The needle of serenity follows its own magnetic north here, and points to the fine sand and radiant sunsets.This is the Gate of the Sun, the least spoiled and most uncrowded sanctuary of the island. The long fetch of the peninsula makes the surfing unreasonably good.Tomas Ramirez, owner of Combate Beach Hotel, is the man to see here. A former pharmaceutical executive, he fell in love with the West and bought his boutique hotel on the sand. He speaks to the laid-back, chill nature of the region, and will give insider tips on the best places for red snapper, conch and lobster; the best places to ride the waves and dive beneath them; the wildlife refuges; the Guanica Dry Forest, the legendary lighthouse; and where to best see and feel the salt flats. This is the place to toss the cell phone, to bury the digital devices, and just surrender to the senses, the present and the frisson of being. Connectivity is as useless and fugitive as necklace beads without a connecting chain, and we are so much better for it.At the end of the day, it is here you will delight in the magic and thrills of paradise; it is here you can find your real self. Simple and grand; timeless and radiant--this is the West of Puerto Rico.5) CentralWhen you stand atop a ridge in the Cordillera Central and look around it seems this is the world's first morning. This is a land of innocence, of new beginnings, of fertility, of pure, clean water and abundance.This is a place unfit for civilization, but the fruit of the tree of adventure is plucked here. From its lodges, to its caves, it ziplines to its trails, adventure is the vitalizing element here. Adventure is everywhere.This is a wild scape, where the trees look as though they have been awoken in the middle of the night and had no time to fix their hair. Sunbeams fracture across the leaves. Waterfalls spill diamonds into limpid pools. Volcanic peaks dissolve into the hard, blue sky. The tropic birds enjoy a vast, loose agenda, and my eyes bewilder at the colors of their freedom. The hills undulate as though they form the backbone of a giant beast that has laid down to sleep and might at any point awake and stand up several miles high, shaking off the vines and trees like pieces of fluff caught on its felt green jacket.It is here I meet two personalities who help define this region. The first is Steven Weingarten, who runs the Casa Grande Mountain Retreat, a former coffee farm sprawling across 107 acres of unruly rainforest. Steven is a former New York attorney who fell in love with the mountains of Puerto Rico while visiting in the mid-90s, and now runs one of the best eco-lodges in the world, while teaching yoga in his on-property studio daily. ""There's a certain feeling about the mountains that's spiritual in nature. With the elevation here you're closer to whatever higher power you might think about or consider when you're talking about spirit,"" reflects Steven standing above his retreat. ""Institution is the shadow and length of the man. So, this place is my work of art.""The second defining personality is Puerto Rican-borne Fernando Samalot, whom I meet at the Casa Grande Café, along with his partner, Bárbara Cruz. Together they are journeying to all 78 municipalities throughout the island, and recording the splendor and magnificence of each through Instagram and other social media. He offers to share a drive through the enveloping mountains, and along the way speaks of the land and its allure. ""I really love this place. Just driving here from the coast, it's like entering a portal, especially with the road carved into the big mountains. I learned to be in love with getting lost here. It's an adventure. You always end up somewhere beautiful and unexpected. It's very rewarding. Sometimes you find the way, and sometimes the way finds you.""There you have it. My attempt to decode the geography of personalities in Puerto Rico. Ultimately, though, it's like an unsolved Rubik's cube, always presenting new combinations, and enticing possibilities. Back at Water Beach Hotel, the zen-like eco lodge on the beach in San Juan, I had a chance to review my findings about the different regions of Puerto Rico.The only common filament is a love of place, and a daring joy of living. When you come here the island stirs some ancient urge to shed our northern skins, to quit the cult of speed, to shatter the glass between before and after, and dive right in, to indulge in the irreducible essence that is Puerto Rico.

138,10 Ways to Save Puerto Rico's Economy,"Dante Disparte, Contributor",1/26/16,"When competing with global headlines, which are keeping many a policymaker awake at night, Puerto Rico can hardly hold attention for very long -- especially in a politically gridlocked Washington obsessed with point scoring and jockeying for the White House. Yet, there are many opportunities to reverse the island's economic woes, which have triggered one of the largest non-conflict related resettlements in recent history. With nearly 10 per cent of the island's inhabitants foregoing the tropical paradise over the last decade, it begs the question of what policy measures can be implemented to reverse this trend and put Puerto Rico on a path toward a brighter future. I have long argued that Puerto Rico's woes are a matter of broad public and security interest in the U.S. and to think the island's hobbled economy is decoupled from pensions, savings and broader economic health is to trigger another 'Lehman-like' game of brinksmanship. While Puerto Rico's municipal debt default continues to spiral out of control, it is more akin to falling down a flight of stairs than a precipitous economic collapse. Collapse is near, however, and the debate in Washington about appointing a Federal Financial Control Board signals that an intervention is nigh. The question remains at what cost will this intervention come and how will the long term future of Puerto Rico's Commonwealth be affected. Already, a mute, non-voting observer on Capitol Hill (Puerto Rico and D.C. share this dubious distinction), the likely long term cost of this intervention from a bill introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch in December, 2015, may remove what little powers Puerto Rico has over its domestic and economic affairs. Against this stark backdrop, some options for a path forward:1.EqualityAcknowledgement of being a U.S. territory conferring equal civil, structural, municipal and financial rights to the island's inhabitants as those enjoyed on the mainland. This includes a voting representative on Capitol Hill. If for this to pass, Puerto Ricans must go to the ballot box exercising their right to self-determination, then such a referendum should be called and the outcome respected. As the expression goes, if you owe the bank $10,000, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank $72 billion, which is Puerto Rico's case, you own the bank. Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code must form part of this turnaround strategy.2.Consensus and CentralizationStreamlined island politics and policymaking. With 78 municipalities on an island 110 miles by 40, cutting through the wool of bureaucracy and special interests leaves the narrowest of the island's social fabric to protect its people. The needed era of fiscal austerity, requires leaner more centralized administration in the collective interests of the island.3.Shared ProsperitySupport for long term valued-adding investors that engage with the local talent pool, promote middle-income and high-skilled jobs and improve economic mobility. Stricter conditions around arbitrage investors are needed genuinely engaging them in the local economy. If John Paulson's vision of Puerto Rico becoming the ""Singapore of the Caribbean"" is to be realized, the era of zero-risk, zero-reward investment must come to an end. Paulson is a famed 'special situation' hedge fund manager who has taken up residence on the island along with sizeable investments.4.Revenue PositiveEnd revenue neutrality. Puerto Rico's low median household income of $19,000 betrays a sizeable underground economy and low-levels of tax adherence from households and businesses. This, coupled with mass migration from the island, which has accelerated to 3,000 residents a week, puts downward pressure on the revenue base against upward pressure on the island's debt burden. Driving tax inclusion and compliance are critical and amnesties along with a simplified tax code should be implemented to spur participation. 5.Right-SizingPrivatization of non-performing, financially strained state-owned enterprises. Beginning with the public electric utility, PREPA, a wave of targeted privatizations of state-owned/operated assets will help right-size the island's balance sheet, improve income while reducing the debt burden. Public-private partnerships can be explored ensuring that the most strategic assets continue to have some public oversight and accountability. Similarly, development concessions around strategically vital industries that improve economic diversification should form part of a revitalization plan.6.Economic IntegrationCreate, strengthen and improve regional economic linkages. With cultural and linguistic ties spanning the Caribbean, Latin and North America, Puerto Rico has an opportunity to position itself not only as a destination for U.S. investors through its tax decrees, like Act 20 and 22, but as a place for long term, value-adding investors throughout the region. Puerto Rico is a natural staging ground for a wide range of service industries and is a natural hub for regional finance, among other sectors. Internal focus on the ease of starting a business and operating on the island are essential. As a measure of this progress, moving up the World Bank's ease of doing business rankings from 57 to parity with the U.S., which is number 7, is a worthy target. Highlighting the distance to Paulson's vision, Singapore ranks number 1 on the list.7.Lifting Legacy LegislationRemoval of onerous, narrow and dated legislation that hampers the island's economic competitiveness. Chief among these strangling rules is the Merchant Marine or Jones Act, which strangles ship-borne trade - the veritable lifeblood of an island economy. By lifting the Jones Act, Puerto Rico has an opportunity to leverage its comparative advantage, geographic location and deep water ports improving regional economic ties, trade and security. The proposed legislation (Puerto Rico Assistance Act of 2015) on turning the island's fortunes around says nothing of the Jones Act.8.Safety and SecurityBroad based improvements in public safety and security. Reversing the tide of violent crime, drug trafficking and the real and perceived dangers on the island are key to assuring public safety, regional security and attracting committed value-adding investors and residents - along with a possible return of the Puerto Rican diaspora. For a highly skilled workforce to see Puerto Rico as more than a brief tourist destination, public safety and security are essential.9.EducationThe only way to combat long term economic change is through a well-equipped, educated workforce. No investment pays better dividends than education and Puerto Rico's latent bilingual abilities in its people can be propelled with a curriculum that emphasizes in-demand careers, technical and vocational training. Program's that match in-state tuition conditions throughout the U.S., like the one offered to D.C. residents, will help address educational affordability and economic mobility.10.EntrepreneurshipRenowned for their can do spirit and optimism, Puerto Ricans must begin to shake the despair and hopelessness of a decade of recession and tell a new story. Much like Detroit's ability to rise from the ashes, Puerto Rico's revival depends on whether a spirit of optimism and risk-taking sinks in through all levels of society. A new startup incubator, Parallel 18, begins to establish a startup ecosystem in Puerto Rico.A new story must be told on Puerto Rico's economic trajectory. The central actor in this story (and the elephant in the room) is the island's final status with the U.S. If current legislation under the Republican-sponsored Puerto Rico Assistance Act of 2015 is adopted, the island and its people lose what autonomy they have. Just as states' rights are sacrosanct, the values enshrined in the Constitution should be upheld for U.S. territories. While an economic intervention is clearly needed, one that incorporates these recommendations will be less costly and will help improve long term competitiveness and security.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/saving-puerto-rico-10-rec_b_9073068,HuffPost,Liberal
211,Zika virus reported in Puerto Rico,Sandee LaMotte,1/2/16," Health officials in Puerto Rico reported the island's first case of Zika, a mosquito-borne virus recently linked to the rise of a serious neurological disorder among newborns in Brazil. ""There is no reason for alarm, and the public should continue to take commonsense steps to avoid mosquito bites,"" Puerto Rican Congressman Pedro Pierluisi said in a  statement  on Thursday. He added that he expects experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to visit the island in early January to educate local physicians to ""properly diagnose and treat the virus."" The CDC has issued a  warning  to tourists traveling to Puerto Rico and other affected areas, asking them to protect themselves from the mosquitoes that spread the virus -- especially pregnant women. The Aedes aegypti mosquito thrives in tropical climates and typically lives around buildings in urban areas. It is known to bite aggressively during the day, but can also attack at night, both indoors and out. It's the same mosquito that can carry yellow fever,  dengue fever  and  chikungunya. There is no vaccine to prevent Zika, and once infected there is no medicine to treat the virus. Symptoms typically include fever, rash, joint pain, and the red eyes of conjunctivitis. They're usually mild, and can last up to a week. Other symptoms can include muscle pain, headache, pain behind the eyes and vomiting. Symptoms typically begin three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.  Brazil hard hit Zika made news recently when it was linked to a rise in  microcephaly , a neurological disorder that can result in incomplete brain development in newborns. Zika first appeared in Brazil in early 2015. More than  2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly  were reported last year in 20 Brazilian states, compared with 147 cases in 2014.  Doctors soon discovered that most of the affected mothers reported having Zika-like symptoms during early pregnancy -- mild fever, rash and headaches. Microcephaly results in babies being born with abnormally small heads that cause often serious developmental issues and sometimes early death. In Brazil, doctors are investigating 29 related infant deaths after an autopsy on November 28 found the Zika virus in a baby born with microcephaly, establishing a link between the two.  ""This is an unprecedented situation, unprecedented in world scientific research,"" Brazil's Health Ministry said on its website. Brazilian officials have encouraged women to  postpone pregnancies  if at all possible. Six Brazilian states have declared a state of emergency; in Brazil's hardest-hit state, Pernambuco, more than 900 cases of microcephaly have been reported. Research continues to determine whether Zika actually causes microcephaly and further establish an association. ""These are newborns who will require special attention their entire lives. It's an emotional stress that just can't be imagined,"" said Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Pernambuco.  The spread of Zika Zika fever was first discovered in Uganda in the 1940s and has since become endemic in parts of Africa. It also spread to the South Pacific and areas of Asia, and most recently to Latin America. Because of global travel, health experts warn the virus could appear anywhere in the world. Zika is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected person, and then spreads the obtained virus by biting others. In theory, the Zika virus could be spread through blood transfusion, but as yet there are no documented cases, the CDC said. There is one case of possible virus transmission via  sexual contact . In the CDC's  travel warning , it urges tourists in Puerto Rico and other affected areas to protect themselves by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants that are not thin enough to bite through, staying and sleeping in air-conditioned rooms with screens on windows, and using insect repellent approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Higher percentages of active ingredients such as DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus and IR3535 protect longer, advises the CDC, and people can also purchase clothing treated with the repellent permethrin, but should not apply it directly to skin.

139,Puerto Rico Is In Serious Trouble. Here's What You Need To Know.,Daniel Marans,1/2/16,"Puerto Rico is on course todefault on some of its debts on Monday, deepening a crisis that has been escalating steadily for months.But the seemingly arcane dispute over the island's public finances masks a struggle for wealth and power in which the peculiarities of Puerto Rico’s political status and Wall Street greed play a leading role. Puerto Rico has $70 billion in total debt that its government saysit cannot pay. No matter who wins, the vast majority of the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call the island home aren't likely to see relief any time soon. Here are seven key facts to understand the debt crisis of a place most Americans know only as a vacation destination:1. Puerto Rico is defaulting on a very small portion of its debt.Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla has said the island will not make a $35.9 million payment to its Infrastructure Finance Authority and another $1.4 million payment it owes its Public Finance Corp. That is a small fraction of the$1 billion in debts that comes due on Jan. 4, including a $328.7 million installment of general obligation debt, which the island’s constitution requires it to prioritize paying above all others debts. Puerto Ricoalready defaulted on payments owed to the Public Finance Corp. in August.Still, the government has had to resort to extreme measures to make the payments on which it is not defaulting. Garcia Padilla told Reuters that the government had to take $163 million in revenues from other agencies in order to meet its Jan. 4 obligations, including the island’s highway, convention center and busing authorities.Puerto Rican news outletEl Vocero also reported on rumors that the government will use money from the public employee pension fund to meet its Jan. 4 payments. The pension administrator said it has been selling assets, but only uses the proceeds to fund retirement benefits.2. Puerto Ricans have already suffered tremendously to meet their obligations.Among the government's tactics to save money is to postpone income tax refunds for an unknown number of Puerto Ricans.José Javier Colon, a professor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico, is one of them: he has yet to receive a refund of $2,000 that is owed him, he said.“The situation is very dire,” Colon said. “For me it is difficult to understand that people are questioning how severe the financial crisis is.”While Puerto Rico may technically be able to make its payments, as David Dayen notes in The American Prospect, it cannot do so without destroying its already-depressed economy.Puerto Rico is trapped in a vicious cycle where the very austerity measures it has taken to meet short-term obligations to creditors -- such as laying off 30,000 public sector workers and increasing its sales tax from 7 percent to 11.5 percent -- have devastated its economy, depleting revenue sources and requiring even more drastic steps just to keep up with payments. One-third of the money coming into Puerto Rico’s coffers annually now goes toward paying creditors. The island’s economy has shrunk 10 percent since 2006 and it now has a poverty rate of 45 percent. The departure of 300,000 Puerto Ricans for the mainland United States in that time -- including 84,000 people in 2014 alone -- means that the burden of debt repayments will fall on an even smaller, poorer pool of island residents.The government's latest move could be a play for time, posits Charles Venator, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut who specializes in Puerto Rican politics. Puerto Rico’s Infrastructure Finance Authority and Public Finance Corp, the two entities the government will miss repaying on Jan. 4, will likely challenge the government in court. That means it could take a year before a court forces the government to pay up, Venator estimates.That will give Garcia Padilla extra time to pressure Congress to grant the island bankruptcy powers, as he did Tuesday.3. Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy without Congress' permission -- and Congress has not been forthcoming. Normally, when a U.S. government, corporation or individual can no longer afford to pay back its lenders in full, it has the right to declare bankruptcy. In bankruptcy proceedings, a judge or arbitrator forges a compromise between the parties that typically forces creditors to take a loss, enabling the borrower to recover. The city of Detroit, for example, sought bankruptcy protection in July 2013, allowing it to cut 74 percent of its unsecured debt.As a commonwealth of the United States, Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy or otherwise restructure its debt without congressional approval. A Democratic-backed proposal to grant the island bankruptcy authority over some of its debts did not make it into the omnibus spending bill that Congress passed Dec. 18. Puerto Rico has tried to restructure its debt to public corporations -- a lower-priority category of debt than the constitutionally protected class of “general obligations” -- using a local bankruptcy law. But a federal court, siding with creditors who challenged the provision, ruled that federal laws barred the island from restructuring that debt. The Supreme Court will hear Puerto Rico’s challenge of the lower court ruling early this year and likely make a ruling by the end of June.The Obama administration seemingly dealt Puerto Rico a setback in its fight for financial independence last week when it argued in a brief for a separate case that the island is a territory that lacks virtually any standing as a sovereign entity -- and will continue to do so unless it achieves statehood or independence.But Venator speculates that the maneuver may be designed to place the onus squarely on Congress by effectively saying the island is the sole responsibility of the U.S.That would certainly be consistent with an approach recently outlined by Antonio Weiss, the Treasury Department official overseeing the administration’s response to the crisis. “Resolving Puerto Rico’s crisis requires congressional action,” Weiss said in a Dec. 9 speech at the Peterson Institute.It is not likely that a resolution developed by a Republican-controlled Congress will be one that Puerto Rico’s Democratic-controlled government or suffering population find favorable.Congressional Republicans have been less eager than Democrats to help Puerto Rico, arguing that the island must reduce social program spending and enact other fiscal reforms first.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has assured House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the House will take action to aid the island by the spring, though it is unclear if that would include debt restructuring.4. Wall Street ""vultures"" are making a killing off the island.Puerto Rico's terms of repayment are particularly onerous because so much of its debt is now controlled by big U.S. hedge funds.In the last year, as Puerto Rico’s spiraling debt effectively prevented it from borrowing on ordinary credit markets, creditors began selling off Puerto Rican debt, as David Dayen reported in The American Prospect. A select group of big investors, most of them hedge funds, stepped in to buy the debt for a mere fraction of its original value.These hedge funds are known as “vultures” because of their attempts to squeeze a profit from a penniless debtor’s proverbial carcass. Vultures buy the debt of cash-strapped sovereign nations -- think Greece and Argentina -- at discounted rates from other investors, who have grown scared they will not be paid back. Then the vultures use every means at their disposal -- the courts, political lobbying, the media -- to ensure that they are paid back at the full-dollar value of the discounted debts they purchased, as well as interest. In Puerto Rico’s case, investors can buy Puerto Rican government bonds from other bondholders for as little as 30 cents on the dollar of their original value and enjoy income from interest rates that go as high as 11 percent. Hedge funds also gave Puerto Rico a much-needed cash infusion in 2014, buying $3.5 billion in general obligation bonds that no one else was willing to buy.It was a good deal for the investors: Puerto Rico’s bonds are tax exempt in all 50 states and the interest rate was 8.7 percent, amounting to what The New York Times estimates was “in effect, a 20 percent return.” What is more, Puerto Rico is constitutionally bound to prioritize payment of the general obligation bonds above all else.5. Other hedge funds have fought to prevent Puerto Rico from gaining bankruptcy powers.There are competing interests at play in the web of investors in Puerto Rican debt. Some of the vulture hedge funds, like those that own the higher-priority general obligation bonds, are supportive of attempts to force investors in Puerto Rico’s public corporations to accept losses. At the same time, other hedge funds, which own debt from Puerto Rico’s public corporations and other entities that would be affected by restructuring, have helped thwart the island’s attempts to persuade Congress to grant it bankruptcy power. Prior to the bankruptcy provision House Democrats tried to get into the omnibus bill, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) was working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on a similar bill granting Puerto Rico powers to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy on some of its debts and give towns and public corporations bankruptcy powers as well.But a group of hedge funds that includes D.E. Shaw -- a firm headed by top Hillary Clinton donor David Shaw -- played a key role in defeating the bipartisan effort with a multi-front lobbying offensive, as The New York Times reported at length. Blue Mountain, another hedge fund in the group, launched a sophisticated astroturf campaign casting the bill, which would cost taxpayers nothing, as a “bailout” that would harm ordinary seniors whose retirement plans rely on returns from Puerto Rican bonds. Rubio withdrew his support under pressure, contributing to the bill’s ultimate collapse. Puerto Rico has little room to take advantage of the apparent divisions between vulture hedge funds and those that have invested in its public corporations. Whether it faces endless legal battles against Wall Street lawyers over the terms of its exorbitant payments to the vulture hedge funds or voluntary negotiations with public corporation bondholders without being able to leverage the threat of bankruptcy, odds are there is a lot more financial pain in the island’s future.6. Puerto Rico is already a tax shelter for Wall Street billionaires.Meanwhile, Wall Street is encouraging the island to enact more austerity to come up with the money needed to pay its debts.A July report commissioned by hedge funds invested in Puerto Rican debt breaks new ground on the subject. It calls for the commonwealth to roll back labor protections, privatize public assets, lay off more public employees and raise sales taxes.Puerto Rico’s previous governor, Republican Luis Fortuño, enacted several tax incentives in 2012 aimed at attracting foreign investors in hopes of boosting the island's finances. The main one was Act 22, a law exempting all of an individual’s investment income from income taxes once the person became a permanent resident of the island.To critics, the calls for belt-tightening and higher taxes are hypocritical. In the wake of the new laws, many hedge fund executives have themselves moved to the island and bought property there as a tax avoidance scheme.Hedge funds have a vested financial interest in promoting regressive tax regimes and lax regulation in order to maximize profits on their new investments in Puerto Rico. Those policies, by definition, may not be in “the best long-term interest of Puerto Rico,” as Matt Fabian of the research firm Municipal Market Analytics told The Huffington Post in July.7. Wall Street and Congress share blame for Puerto Rico's accumulation of debt in the first place.To hear some commentators tell it, Puerto Rico is in a mess entirely of its own making, and any attempt to provide it relief will only encourage the island’s bad behavior.There is some truth in their argument. Successive Puerto Rican governments decided to issue more and more debt to cover costs, rather than make fiscal adjustments, when the island’s economy began generating less revenue than it had in the past. Puerto Rico’s debt increased every year since 2000, a report commissioned by the current government has found.The island’s utility monopolies are notoriously inefficient. The state-owned power company relies on expensive and dirty fossil fuel imports to generate electricity for the island and is not transparent about the high rates it charges customers.The World Bank ranked the island 57th in the world in terms of ease of doing business, just below Mongolia and above Costa Rica. (The United States is ranked seventh.)But all of that ignores two essential factors underlying Puerto Rico’s debt crisis.Puerto Rico ramped up its debt accumulation in response to an economic calamity Congress largely created. From 1976 to 1996, Puerto Rico’s economy grew steadily thanks largely to Section 936 of the U.S. tax code, which exempted U.S. manufacturers on the island from taxes. In 1996, the Clinton administration and Congress passed a 10-year phase-out of the exemption, but as The American Prospect noted, “Congress did not replace Section 936 with an economic development plan for Puerto Rico to offset the impact.”Manufacturers left Puerto Rico in droves as the exemption faded away and the island’s economy has never really recovered.Another odd rule related to Puerto Rico’s reliance on the U.S. also hinders the island's economic potential. The Jones Act prohibits foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo from one U.S. port to another. As a result, foreign ships with goods destined for the mainland U.S. cannot stop at Puerto Rico first -- or vice versa -- without transferring the cargo onto a U.S. ship.The law is blamed for the high price of imported consumer goods in Puerto Rico.In addition, U.S.-based investors actively participated in, and even encouraged, Puerto Rico’s debt binge. Puerto Rico’s municipal bonds, which are uniquely exempt from local, state and federal taxes in all 50 states, provided returns that were too hard to pass up. Investors often bought the bonds despite their inherent risks, said Colon, of the University of Puerto Rico.“Creditors who bought those bonds knew that there was an increasing gap between the economic activity of Puerto Rico and its debts,” Colon said. “The financial sector made lots of money off those bond sales.”The sector's role in creating the crisis does not eliminate the need for political and fiscal reforms in Puerto Rico, Colon insisted.But it does undermine arguments against granting Puerto Rico authority to declare bankruptcy over at least some of its debts, which Colon said is “essential.”Venator sees a long-overdue resolution of Puerto Rico’s ill-defined political status as a possible silver lining of the debt crisis.“It is an opportunity to deal with a politically and economically bankrupt territorial system created by Congress,” he said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly suggested that U.S.-based labor union pension funds were significant purchasers of Puerto Rican municipal bonds.Also on HuffPost:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-debt-default-explained_n_56870c25e4b0b958f65bca7a,HuffPost,Liberal
140,Puerto Rico Is Up In Arms Because The Obama Administration Basically Just Called It A Colony,Cristian Farias,12/30/15,"As the federal government's lead lawyer before the Supreme Court, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has an important but relatively narrow role: By design, his views are intended to sway the justices and the justices alone.But abrief Verrilli filed last week with the court -- for an under-the-radar case in which the U.S. isn't even a party -- made waves far beyond, eliciting a media maelstrom in Puerto Rico, impassioned responses from officials and even an appeal to the U.N. The controversy brings to the fore a longstanding debate about the island's political future, which is already at a tipping point thanks to Puerto Rico's ongoing debt crisis.The reason for the uproar: Verrilli's brief stressed that Puerto Rico is still only a U.S. territory -- a non-sovereign with limited authority over its affairs.In a telling passage, the solicitor general told the Supreme Court that Puerto Rico ""could become"" a sovereign, but ""only if it were to attain statehood or become an independent nation.""After Verrilli filed the brief, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla issued a forceful statement that essentially accused the federal government of doing an about-face. García Padilla, who supports neither statehood nor independence for Puerto Rico, called Verilli's stance ""contrary to all Supreme Court jurisprudence"" on the commonwealth's historic self-governance.The solicitor general ""has decided to adopt a position that's at odds with prior postures by his office with regards to the sovereignty of the Commonwealth,"" García Padilla said on Thursday,according to El Nuevo Día, a leading Puerto Rican newspaper.Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico'snon-voting representative in Congress and a supporter of statehood,weighed in that same day, pointing to Verrilli's arguments as evidence that it was time for Puerto Ricans to stop accepting their status quo as ""second-class citizens."" The brief, Pierluisi said, was ""without a doubt the most complete document ever published by the United States government on the issue of Puerto Rico's political status.""Quite a fallout from a case that, strictly speaking, isn't even about Puerto Rican sovereignty.Rather, Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle is a criminal case involving two men who were convicted of gun crimes by the federal government. Puerto Rico wanted to prosecute them, too, but the defendants claimed that a second prosecution for roughly the same conduct violated the Constitution'sdouble jeopardy clause.All 50 states, which the Constitution treats as ""dual sovereigns,"" can launch their own criminal prosecutions after the federal government has done so, provided somebasic tests are met.But Puerto Rico is different, since it's a U.S. territory, not a state. The island's own high court ruled against the local government in the Sánchez Valle case earlier this year, saying the commonwealth has, essentially, no constitutional power of its own.""Puerto Rico's authority to prosecute individuals is derived from its delegation by [the] United States Congress and not by virtue of its own sovereignty,"" the Puerto Rico Supreme Court said in March.The court then took it up a notch: Puerto Rico never had any ""original or prior sovereignty"" to begin with. Rather, it explained, ""the United States has managed Puerto Rico through legislation passed pursuant to the territorial clause of the federal Constitution.""Those fighting words were arguably the reason that Puerto Rico's government appealed Sánchez Valle to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear the case on Jan. 13. (Earlier this month, the justices agreed to hear a second case dealing with the island's debt crisis.)So why did the solicitor general's office get involved? The answer is that it often files briefs in cases when there's a substantial federal interest meriting the government's views -- whether the matter is same-sex marriage, affirmative action or anything with implications for the country as a whole. What seems to have provoked outrage among some in Puerto Rico's political class was Verrilli's assertion that ""Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign."" In line with the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, he argued that just because the island adopted its own constitution and a form of self-government in the 1950s -- all with Congress' blessing -- that doesn't mean it can claim a right to something it never had.""The Obama administration is essentially taking the position that Puerto Rico is a colony, which betrays the commitments the United States made to the world in the aftermath of World War II, when the self-governing Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was created,"" said Richard Pildes, a law professor at NYU who has been following the case and has worked on other cases dealing with Puerto Rico's legal interests.Indeed, ""colony"" is exactly the word the Puerto Rican governor used in a follow-up letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- to alert the international community that the U.S. had ""abruptly reversed course"" in how it views the island's status.""The U.S. Government has effectively taken the position that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is unconstitutional insofar as it is based on an exercise of popular sovereignty by the People of Puerto Rico,"" García Padilla said in the letter, which was made public on Sunday.It is anyone's guess whether this political back-and-forth will come up at the January hearing in the Sánchez Valle case. But whatever the justices say over the course of deciding the case will reverberate in upcoming discussions over the commonwealth's standing.""Even small statements related to this issue potentially will have great significance for debates and executive-branch and congressional-branch policy going forward on Puerto Rico’s status,"" Pildes wrote in October, when the Supreme Court first took up the case.As for Verrilli, he'll likely get to make eye contact with Puerto Rico's lawyers very soon: When he filed the brief, he also asked the court to give him a few minutes to argue on behalf of the United States.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-sovereignty-supreme-court_n_56816a76e4b0b958f659eee5,HuffPost,Liberal

213,Miss Puerto Rico suspended after anti-Muslim tweets,Dana Ford,12/20/15," Miss Puerto Rico 2015 has been suspended indefinitely for posting a series of anti-Muslim messages on Twitter. Destiny Velez tweeted filmmaker Michael Moore last week after he launched a campaign that encouraged people to make signs saying ""We are all Muslim"" and post photographs of themselves holding the signs online. Her Twitter page has since been taken down, and Velez has apologized. CNN obtained a screen grab of the page, and among the messages she originally sent were: ""Muslims use our constitution to terrorize USA & plant gas stations,"" ""there's NO comparison between Jews, Christians & Muslims. Jews nor Christians have terrorizing agendas in their sacred books, and ""all what Muslims have done is provided oil & terrorize this country & many others!!!!!!."" The Miss Puerto Rico Organization issued a statement over the weekend distancing itself from her comments. ""In regards to Miss Puerto Rico, Destiny Velez's, recent actions and conduct; the Miss Puerto Rico Organization feels that her words do not represent the integrity and esteem of our program, nor that of our board members, our sponsors and partners, or the National Organization,"" it read. ""Miss Velez's actions were in contradiction to the organization, and therefore as a consequence of her actions, she has been suspended indefinitely. The Miss Puerto Rico Organization will not tolerate any actions or behavior contrary to the Miss Puerto Rico Organization."" The organization's statement also included an apology from Velez. ""I apologize to the people I have offended with my words. I am first and foremost an #UpStander and as such I stand up against bullying. The last thing I wanted to do was to bully anyone. Again, I apologize to anyone who felt offended with my words,"" she said. Velez competed in this year's Miss America contest. The Miss America Organization similarly tried to distance itself from her comments, releasing a statement saying it does not agree, condone or support what she said. MOA also said that it was working with the Miss Puerto Rico Organization to ""resolve the issue."" Last week, Moore posted a picture of himself holding a sign reading ""We are all Muslim"" in front of Trump Tower in New York City.

141,House Sets Timeline To Help Puerto Rico Handle Fiscal Crisis,Laura Barrón-López,12/18/15,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats' efforts to include debt restructuring powers for Puerto Rico in the House's massive omnibus spending bill on Friday fell short, yielding only a commitment from Republican leadership to work on legislation that would help the ailing island by next spring.Puerto Rico faces astaggering $72 billion debt, $900 million of which it must pay to bondholders on Jan. 1. The commonwealth willdefault on its debt in January or May, said Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla on Wednesday.Attempting to address the crisis before the new year, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to secure unanimous consent for a vote on legislation that would have temporarily protected Puerto Rico from being sued by creditors until Congress acts. “The Puerto Rico Emergency Financial Stability Act would protect the 3.5 million Americans who call Puerto Rico home from economic catastrophe while Congress advances a more comprehensive solution to the Commonwealth’s financial emergency,"" Pelosi said. ""The bill would give Puerto Rico temporary but essential breathing room from creditor lawsuits until Congress can act.""As expected, Pelosi's symbolic tactic failed, and consent was not granted for a vote. Minutes later, the House voted on final passage of the omnibus bill, which passed with the help of 166 Democrats. In a small meeting with reporters ahead of the omnibus vote, Pelosi said Democrats made one more ""last-ditch effort"" to include something in the bill that would address the debt crisis in Puerto Rico.But Republican leaders weren't having any of it. Instead, to woo more House Democrats to vote for the omnibus, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) instructed relevant committees to work with the Puerto Rican government to find a solution. ""While we could not agree to including precedent-setting changes to bankruptcy law in this omnibus spending bill, I understand that many members on both sides of the aisle remain committed to addressing the challenges facing the territory,"" Ryan said in a statement earlier this week.Pelosi said the first hearing will be held the day Congress returns in January. Ryan also promised to ""take action on restructuring legislation byMarch 31,"" she said. ""I feel confident that he will follow up on it,"" Pelosi added.But after the House passed the omnibus bill with no aid for Puerto Rico attached, reality sunk in. Garcia Padilla blamed Congress for allowing the situation on the island to ""unfold into chaos."" ""After weeks of crippling lobbying by Wall Street, Congress denied fairness and due process -- which costs nothing to the U.S. taxpayers,"" Padilla said on Friday.""I will hold Speaker Ryan to his public declaration that Congress will reach a solution by the end of March, which must include broad, comprehensive restructuring authority and an economic growth plan,"" he added.Also on HuffPost:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-timeline-puerto-rico-crisis_n_56741385e4b06fa6887cf25a,HuffPost,Liberal
142,Virtual Bankruptcy for Puerto Rico,"Lynn M. LoPucki, Contributor",12/8/15,"Twenty-five years before the failures of the United States Congress and the Commonwealth's government caused a debt crisis in Puerto Rico, a philosopher painted on a cliff side over a slum in Mexico City: ""The national debt is not the debt of the people."" The bite of that truth is now being felt in Puerto Rico. For the past decade, Puerto Rico's creditors have forced austerity in an effort to make the Puerto Rican people pay for the governments' failures. Many Puerto Ricans -- who didn't sign the promissory notes, can't be held liable for the debt, and have the legal right to move to the mainland -- are simply leaving the island and the austerity behind.At $72 billion, the debt far exceeds Puerto Rico's ability to pay. Everyone knows that the creditors must accept massive losses, and everyone knows pretty much what the total amount of those losses must be. What remains to be determined are the proportions in which the various creditors will share the losses. In short, Puerto Rico is descending into chaos for lack of a legal process that can force the greediest of the creditors to accept their fair share.Such a process is available to every state or territory of the United States except Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. That process -- recently used in the rescue of Detroit - is debt adjustment under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Congress excluded Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities from Chapter 9 by legislation adopted in 1984. Neither the legislative history nor any other source provides a reason for the exclusion. Congress could correct its mistake even at this late date, but the Republicans won't go along. They argue that the lenders relied on Puerto Rico's inability to file bankruptcy, so it is unfair to change the rules now. The lenders, they say, should have their full, non-bankruptcy remedies. On Friday, the Supreme Court accepted a case that may validate a Puerto Rican law that substitutes for Chapter 9, but the decision in that case is not expected until June -- too late for the current crisis.Fortunately, a legal strategy exists by which Puerto Rico and its creditors can have the benefits of Chapter 9 now, without denying any creditor its full, non-bankruptcy remedies. The Puerto Rico government can create a virtual Chapter 9 for itself by granting a security interest - essentially a mortgage -- in all of the assets creditors could seize to all creditors who agree to suspend their collection efforts and be bound by the virtual Chapter 9 outcome. Technically, the virtual Chapter 9 would be an arbitration, the arbitrator probably a retired United States Bankruptcy Judge, and the governing rules the provisions of Chapter 9.Creditors who prefer their legal remedies would have full access to them. They could sue in the courts, obtain judgments, and enforce those judgments against the debtor's assets to the full extent of the law. Enforcement is by physical seizure and sale of the assets. If such seizures actually occurred, they would certainly generate chaos. But the law gives secured creditors priority over the rights of judgment creditors and the right to block such seizures. That right would continue for the duration of the virtual Chapter 9 and probably for many years afterwards. Even when the crisis was over, the judgment creditors' collection rights would remain subordinate to those of the secured creditors. For these reasons, few or no creditors would actually prefer their legal remedies over participation in the virtual Chapter 9.To my knowledge, this strategy has never been employed by a government. But a less-virulent strain of it has been used successfully by insolvent Silicon Valley companies as far back as the dot-com bubble. Palo Alto attorney Lincoln Brooks used it in about fifty cases. Companies granted security interests to the local Creditor Managers' Association as trustee for all of the companies' unsecured creditors. Dissident unsecured creditors were free to obtain judgments and try to seize assets. But they tried in only about five cases and they succeeded in none of them.The virtual Chapter 9 strategy would generate enough leverage over creditors for Puerto Rico to deal with its debt crisis. The risk is that it would generate too much. Without an actual Chapter 9 to limit the Puerto Rican government, that government could design a procedure even more to its benefit. The creditors would still have to participate for exactly the same reasons. The government might even find in this strategy a way to continue outspending their revenues indefinitely. For the benefit of Puerto Rico's creditors as well as its people, Congress needs to fix the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 loophole before it is too late.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/virtual-bankruptcy-for-pu_b_8751652,HuffPost,Liberal
214,Carson backs Puerto Rico statehood,Deena Zaru and Elizabeth Landers,11/8/15," Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson endorsed statehood for Puerto Rico at a Sunday campaign event on the island. ""In a Carson administration, I will leave no stone unturned in my efforts to secure this important step in Puerto Rico's history -- establishing Estado 51,"" said the retired neurosurgeon, highlighting the strategic benefits of the Caribbean island's location relative to the United States mainland.  Amid mounting scrutiny recently over his past, Carson traveled to the island territory to address a statehood advocacy group convention. The campaign estimated that 3,500 people were attended the New Progressive Party rally, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel.  ""Mis hermanos Americanos, my campaign is built around the premise of 'We the People,' and through such lens, I view the statehood question in Puerto Rico as settled,"" Carson said, referring to a 2012 referendum in which a majority of island voters backed making Puerto Rico the 51st state.  Carson's statehood advocacy is generally inline with Republican presidential candidates from Florida, the state closest to Puerto Rico. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio have said they would back Puerto Rico statehood if that's what island residents want. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has not endorsed statehood but  said  she wants to ""ensure whatever choice Puerto Rico makes will be respected."" She has called on Congress to give the economically struggling island ""a fair shot at success"" by allowing it to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy -- a lifeline that is  supported  by Bush but  opposed  by Rubio.",https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/08/politics/ben-carson-puerto-rico-statehood/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjTsfud2cj6AhUBRjABHYd6Ajo4PBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw0a-iW-8K7q1h9A8ud52A8h,CNN,Liberal
143,"Puerto Rico Crisis: It's Not About the Debt, It's About the Politics","David Paul, Contributor",8/17/15,"When the Puerto Rico debt crisis burst into the news, Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro García Padilla pronounced that the Commonwealth's debt crisis ""is not about politics."" Of course, to paraphrase H.L. Menken, when a politician says something is not about politics, chances are it's all about politics. That is not to say that Puerto Rico's massive debts are payable or that the math is not suffocating, but long before the debts were massive, and long before the math became intractable, there were the politics. To put in place a plan to address Puerto Rico's debt crisis without taking account of the long simmering witch's brew of island and federal politics and policies that led us to this point would be folly.While federal and island officials alike are loath to use the ""c"" word, Puerto Rico has been a colony of the United States for just over 100 years. Like colonies across the globe that traded hands among European powers as the spoils of one war or another, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States -- along with Guam and the Philippines -- by Spain in 1898 after its defeat in the Spanish-American War.Americans are generally not comfortable with the notion that we are a colonial power. Global hegemon or imperial nation perhaps, but not colonial overlord. Maybe it is because we were once a colony ourselves. Perhaps our struggles to overcome our legacy as a slave power left us uncomfortable with the idea that through much of the 20th century we ruled over Caribbean sugarcane plantations where the descendants of slaves continued to toil.The Founders set forth the terms of America's dominion over its colonies under Article Four of the Constitution -- aptly known as the Territories Clause -- and directed that full plenary power and responsibility over America's territories was to be vested in Congress. For the better part of the century that Puerto Rico has remained an American colony, a series of legal cases have explored and defined the relationship of U.S. territories to the United States, but over that time little has fundamentally changed. As set forth in the Territories Clause, and as confirmed repeatedly by the Supreme Court, Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory of the United States for which Congress remains fully and unambiguously responsible.It is notable, then, that throughout the public discussion and debate over the past several months about the insolvency of Puerto Rico, there has been little or no discussion of the ultimate responsibility of Congress for events that have transpired. Congress has never been shy about exercising its oversight powers in areas that offer political opportunity -- Benghazi and the IRS are recent examples -- and is often swift to demand full accountability and point the finger of blame at others for any manner of controversy or scandal that might come up, but with respect to the territories, where the responsibility of Congress is clear, we have heard a deafening silence. There is no Committee on the Territories in either the House and the Senate through which it might have exercised its responsibility over the years, and none of the Tea Party members who carry a copy of the Constitution in their breast pocket have been seen thumbing through it in front of an assembled gaggle of reporters demanding that Congress that it be held accountable for its own failure of duty as the Puerto Rico crisis has escalated.The economic and fiscal crisis now confronting Puerto Rico has been building for years, and is a direct outgrowth of political and policy decisions made at the local and national level. It was two decades ago that Congress -- with the support of then-Governor Pedro Rossello of the pro-statehood party -- legislated the end of the Section 936 tax benefit program that for decades had been the basis for a thriving manufacturing sector on the island and a domestic capital market that provided low cost funding for infrastructure and other purposes. And it was in the same timeframe that Puerto Rican activists demanded the curtailment of missile testing on the island of Vieques, which ultimately resulted in the closing of the Roosevelt Roads naval base on Puerto Rico.The end of the 936 program and the closing of Roosevelt Roads both came to a head around 2006, which is generally viewed as the beginning of the long slide in employment on Puerto Rico, the outmigration of Puerto Ricans to the mainland, and the growth in debt that Governor García Padilla now deems to be unpayable. The end of the 936 program and the closing of Roosevelt Roads were political decisions for which Congress and Puerto Rican officials each bear culpability and that together laid the groundwork for the current crisis.Puerto Rico politics have long been defined by differences over the preferred political relationship with the United States. Governor García Padilla's Popular Democratic Party stands for continued Commonwealth status while the New Progressive Party of former Governor Rossello stands for statehood. The third force in local politics, representing those who favor independence, has historically had a far smaller share of the vote -- though Puerto Rican ""nationalism"" remains a powerful political and cultural force.Much to the chagrin of the United States, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization -- created to support self-determination for colonized peoples -- instigated several plebiscites on the political status of Puerto Rico, beginning in 1993 when the Puerto Rico electorate voted 45 percent, 45 percent and 10 percent for statehood, current status and independence, respectively. Over the years, the preference for statehood has grown, with the most recent plebiscite showing a 60-plus percent preference for statehood over the current territorial status, and just last month the Puerto Rico non-voting delegate to Congress, Pedro Pierluisi -- a member of the statehood party -- published an op-ed in the New York Times arguing that statehood is the only solution for what ails the Commonwealth.But neither the United Nations nor Puerto Rico politicians can make Puerto Rico a state. That can only come about through an act of Congress, and Congressional approval of a new state that would more likely than not send two new Democrats to the U.S. Senate and a half dozen or so new Democrats to the House of Representatives -- projected to come primarily at the expense of red state delegations -- is unlikely to win approval in a Republican-dominated Congress. Nonetheless, the political status of the former Spanish colony that would be the 17th largest state if admitted to the Union remains the dominant political subtext even as Puerto Rico careens into insolvency.Today, Congress and the White House are largely speaking with one voice as they argue against a ""bailout"" for Puerto Rico. Instead -- as evidenced by the support of both Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush -- the magic bullet that many support is to allow Puerto Rico to seek protection under the federal Bankruptcy Code, which is not currently available for U.S. territories. Bankruptcy seems like a neat solution, though advocates conveniently ignore the fact that allowing Puerto Rico access to bankruptcy protection would also be a form of bailout, but one that would place the cost of the bailout on the backs of the millions of Americans that currently own Puerto Rico bonds -- directly or through mutual funds -- that would take a significant haircut in any debt restructuring mandated by a bankruptcy court.The presence of hedge funds -- a category of opportunistic investors that is quite different from mutual funds -- as owners of a share of Puerto Rico debts is going to complicate any proposed resolution. Puerto Rico bonds have been purchased by mutual funds for years, if not decades, and they are now among the most widely held securities in Americans' savings accounts. Hedge funds only became significant buyers of Puerto Rico debt over the past two years, most notably in 2014 when Puerto Rico issued $3.5 billion of bonds to pay operating costs and push the advent of the current insolvency crisis a year down the road.At that time, Puerto Rico's traditional mutual fund investor community declined to participate in the new financing. That was the moment when the decade-long decline in Puerto Rico fiscal affairs had become fully evident and a tipping point had been reached. At that time, when access to capital looked to be precluded -- forcing the Puerto Rico administration to come to grips with its fiscal problems -- the hedge fund community saw an opportunity and purchased nearly all of the multi-billion dollar financing.The $3.5 billion bond issue purchased by the hedge fund community seemed like a blessing at the time for the Puerto Rico administration of Governor García Padilla. It not only allowed the inevitable collapse to be pushed down the road, but more specifically it allowed the crisis to be deferred to a presidential election year, when a politically friendly solution would be more likely due to the large Puerto Rican representation in key electoral college states. Governor García Padilla showed his cards with respect to the deeply political calculus involved when he bluntly threatened both political parties if they fail to support Puerto Rico's preferred solution of achieving access to the bankruptcy courts: ""Puerto Ricans decide the elections in Florida. That's very important. By deciding the election in Florida, we can decide [who is the next] president of the United States.""Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush have read the electoral map, and are now each on record supporting Governor García Padilla's demand that Puerto Rico be allowed access to bankruptcy protection. And they are not alone. National publications from the New York Times to the Weekly Standard have made similar arguments, and the Obama administration seems to be heading in that direction.Bankruptcy sounds like such a reasonable solution. After all, municipal governments across the country are allowed to use bankruptcy as a tool for renegotiating debts that have become unaffordable. Puerto Rico leaders believe that they have sufficient leverage over the national political parties to secure the legislative changes necessary to allow them to use bankruptcy as a means to renegotiate their outstanding obligations, while leaving their powers of self-governance -- as enshrined in the 1952 Commonwealth Constitution approved by Congress -- largely unaffected going forward. For their part, Democrats and Republicans in Congress seem to be embracing bankruptcy as a path of least resistance, one that allows them to wash their hands of the problem while others pay the bill.But despite the appeal of bankruptcy as an easy solution for Puerto Rico, it is unlikely to play out that way over time. The mutual fund community -- the trustees for the millions of Americans that own Puerto Rico bonds -- has indicated that it will fight efforts in Congress to change the bankruptcy code on an after-the-fact-basis. But it is the hedge fund managers -- individuals with their own money on the line -- who constitute the greatest threat to the easy solution envisioned by politicians in Puerto Rico and Washington. Those investors -- whose money Governor García Padilla eagerly accepted when it seemed politically advantageous to do so -- who will take the fight all the way to the Supreme Court to demand adherence to the law as well as Congressional accountability.It may be appealing given the anti-Wall Street mood in the country to place some share of the burden on the backs of hedge fund managers -- after all, they are highly compensated opportunists who bought Puerto Rico bonds after the insolvency was evident -- but there will be considerable political blowback against that line of argument once it becomes apparent that the tens of billions of dollars that a Puerto Rico bankruptcy bailout is going to cost would primarily be seized from the retirement savings of tens of millions of ordinary Americans.Ultimately, the problem with bankruptcy as a solution is that it will not solve the problem. The insolvency of Puerto Rico is not simply a fiscal crisis but is a constitutional one. Since the approval of its constitution in 1952, Puerto Rico has enjoyed significant powers of self-government, but as the Supreme Court has ruled, none of those powers has removed Congress from its position of ultimate responsibility, and like a parent that has ignored its responsibility for a wayward child, Congress may have looked the other way, but at the end of the day it remains responsible for the welfare of the all of the U.S. territories. If the failure of duty is placed on Congress -- as the Constitution suggests that it must be -- then at the end of the day the price of the Puerto Rico debt crisis is one that we all will be forced to pay, and Puerto Rico and the Congress will have to recraft their relationship going forward so that the current problems are not repeated in the future.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
215,Who owns Puerto Rico's debt?,Heather Long,8/6/15,"Puerto Rico is being dubbed ""America's Greece."" The island has too much debt that it can't pay.  While the island managed to  avoid default  by making its big July 1 bond payments, Puerto Rico still has over $70 billion in outstanding debt to go. Governor Alejandro García Padilla has said the country won't be able to pay that all back, dubbing it a "" death spiral .""    
 
  ""To tell you the truth, Puerto Rico is a bigger problem for American investors than Greece,"" Alan Valdes, director of floor trading at DME Securities told CNN. ""Most American investors have little exposure to Greece at all.""     The fallout:  So who gets hurt if Puerto Rico doesn't pay up   -- or if it only pays back a fraction of what it owes? It could be you.    A lot of regular Americans hold these bonds.   ""I am worried. Any Puerto Rican is worried,"" Rey J. de Leon, a 42-year-old lawyer in Puerto Rico told CNNMoney. ""We have a lot of people who are seniors and they depend on the returns from those bonds to live on a month-to-month basis.""   Over 20% of bond mutual funds own Puerto Rican bonds, according to data from Morningstar (the exact numbers are 377 funds out of 1,884 United States bond mutual funds).   The majority of the funds with exposure are municipal bond funds or high yield bond funds. Puerto Rico's bonds have municipal status, meaning they are tax exempt. That's why a lot of retirees buy them.   In total, bond mutual funds hold about $11.3 billion of the island's debt. Another roughly $15 billion is held by hedge funds. The remainder of the debt is held largely by individuals -- mostly Puerto Ricans and mainland Americans.   ""This is not the time to sell. The time to sell was maybe two or three years ago,"" says de Leon. He is still confident Puerto Rico will be able to find a solution.     Is your bond fund invested?  Puerto Rico's bonds have also been demoted to ""junk"" status. Many insurance firms and pensions can't hold Puerto Rican debt anymore because it has junk status. High yield bond funds invest in debt that is of poorer quality because it usually carries a higher interest rate to compensate investors for the extra risk they are taking on.   Among the funds that hold Puerto Rican debt, some of the largest are run by OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Templeton. For example, the  Franklin Double Tax-Free Income Fund   ( FPRIX )  holds nearly half of its investments in Puerto Rican bonds. The fund is down 4.5% this year and has only a 1-star rating out of 5 by Morningstar.   Numerous Oppenheimer Rochester municipal funds hold 15% or more of the fund in Puerto Rican bonds, including the  Oppenheimer Rochester MD Municipal Fund   ( ORMDX ) , which is down 5% this year and has a 3-star rating from Morningstar.   Funds are making it clear that they will pursue legal action if Puerto Rico doesn't pay.   ""We expect Puerto Rico to act within the tenets of the law, including the Commonwealth's Constitution, and are ready to defend the previously agreed to terms in each and every bond indenture,"" said a spokesman from OppenheimerFunds.   In a  blog post  Tuesday, Franklin Templeton's co-heads of the municipal bond group wrote: ""At the very least, in our assessment, Puerto Rico can expect creditors to seek legal affirmation and protection of contractual rights.""     What's next?  On Monday night, Padilla boldly asked Congress to grant Puerto Rico the ability to declare bankruptcy. Under U.S. law, only cities like Detroit and municipalities can declare bankruptcy.   Puerto Rico is putting together a ""working group"" to come up with a solution to its debt dilemma by the end of August. The island's economy has been stuck in recession for nearly a decade, which further hampers its ability to generate taxes and pay back creditors.   Governor Padilla likes to say that Puerto Rico should not have to choose between paying its police and teachers or paying its creditors. But a lot of retirees and ""regular Joe's"" own Puerto Rico's debt on the other end.

216,Why Puerto Rico attracts billionaires despite economic woes,Patrick Gillespie,8/5/15,"Puerto Rico is  in default , its economy is tanking and the government is  rationing water .  But some billionaires love the island anyway.    
 
  Puerto Rico is trying to lure wealth from the mainland U.S. with generous tax exemptions or cuts on corporate taxes, personal income, capital gains and other sources of profit.   The approach is sort of working. About 250 people with a net worth of $1 million have moved to the island since the law was introduced in 2012. Billionaire  John Paulson  is leading the charge of Wall Street wealth bound for Puerto Rico.   However, one of Puerto Rico's biggest problems is its  shrinking tax base  as thousands of Puerto Ricans  leave  for Florida or Texas in search of a better economy. Welcoming wealthy mainland Americans with tax breaks would appear to be at odds with one of the island's dire needs: tax money.     Still, some say the tax exemptions could make Puerto Rico the next Singapore -- an extremely wealthy tax haven.   Peter Schiff moved his asset management firm from Newport Beach, Calif., to San Juan in 2013. Schiff has bought a house in the Ritz Carlton compound just outside San Juan and water is not a problem for him. He plans to move there once his son graduates from high school. Individuals must live in Puerto Rico for 183 days a year to qualify for tax breaks.   But his company is already enjoying financial benefits, paying a low corporate tax rate of 4%. In California, Schiff's firm had to pay the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is about 35%. He says tax breaks like those encourage him to create more jobs, which Puerto Rico badly wants.    ""I'm saving a lot of money,"" says Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital. ""It's the closest thing to renouncing your U.S. citizenship without actually doing it...You're still an American, you're just out from under the IRS.""   For Puerto Rico, the point of the tax breaks is to make the island a home for the rich and their businesses so they'll spend their money there.   Puerto Rico needs cash fast. The island's government has about $70 billion in outstanding debt. It  defaulted on Monday  after it failed to make a small payment on its debt owed mostly to ordinary Puerto Ricans, who own the bonds through local credit unions called ""cooperativas.""   The Puerto Rican government will present a restructuring proposal to its creditors by the end of August.   For now, default isn't deterring the mega-rich from Puerto Rico's tax-free business environment.   ""Let's say you want to start a business. Just start it in Puerto Rico. Why would you start it anywhere else?"" says Schiff.

218,Puerto Rico's other crisis: It's running out of water,Patrick Gillespie,8/4/15,"Puerto Rico doesn't have enough money to pay its bills. It  went into default  for the first time in its history on Monday. Now it's running out of water too. Literally.  A drought has forced the island's government to ration water. It's become so bad that the government is actually turning off tap water in people's homes, sometimes for days at a time. The main tourist areas, however, are exempt for now.    
 
  It's easy to blame this problem on the hot, dry weather, but Puerto Ricans say that isn't the only culprit. They believe the government has mismanaged the island's water supply and pipes for years.   Juan Camacho's home will have running water for a day and then no water at all for the following two days. He lives in Trujillo Alto, a town that is a mere 13 miles from downtown San Juan, the capital.   When the water comes back on, many Puerto Ricans like Camacho keep the faucets running for hours, filling up cans, bowls and bins with water.     Temperatures in Trujillo Alto hit 91 degrees Fahrenheit Monday.   Camacho, a social activist, says the government has poorly maintained the local reservoir in his area, causing dirt to get in the reservoir, thus making the water undrinkable.   ""We have a big drought problem,"" says Camacho, 68. ""We are saving water -- not just for drinking -- but for bathing and other fundamental things.""   This isn't Puerto Rico's first water shortage.    In 1994, the island went through a similar water crisis. Puerto Ricans hoarded water then like they are now. Buckets of water sitting in a hot, tropical climate gave birth to mosquitoes, which sparked a Dengue fever outbreak.   Maritza Stanchich remembers it well. She got Dengue fever in 1994. It was one of the worst experiences of her life. The government imposed water rations today make her concerned that another Dengue outbreak could ensue.   A professor at the University of Puerto Rico, Stanchich isn't affected by the water rations since her San Juan neighborhood is a tourist hot spot. Still, she's helping out friends who get their water turned off.   ""I've offered showers to some of my friends in the area,"" says Stanchich.   It's another major problem in a summer of sad news for Puerto Rico. Add on  the default , an economy spiraling out of control and concerns about Congress lowering Medicare funding to the island, and it's easy to understand  why Puerto Ricans are leaving  in a mass exodus.   ""This is a perfect storm in the worst sense of the word,"" says Stanchich.

217,Puerto Rico's crisis ... in 2 minutes,Patrick Gillespie and Heather Long,8/4/15,"Puerto Rico has been dubbed ""America's Greece."" The island  defaulted on its debt  for the first time ever on Monday. If you're just catching up, here's the latest on the crisis -- and what you need to know. Last updated August 3 at 3:50pm ET.  1. Puerto Rico is now in default. It paid only $628,000 of a $58 million debt payment that was due by Monday. This marks the  first default  in the island's history.    
 
  2. In total, Puerto Rico owes about $70 billion to its creditors. Its governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said the government cannot pay all of its debt. He says the Puerto Rican economy is in a "" death spiral ."" He has put together a working group to come up with a plan by the end of the summer.   3. Puerto Rico is in a debt crisis because the government has overspent for years while the island's economy has shrank. Puerto Rico has the same amount of debt that New York State has, but the population of Connecticut.   4. The island is supposed to pay a total of $483 million on Monday. Experts believe Puerto Rico will pay all of that except for $58 million that's due to the Public Finance Cooperation.    5. Regular Puerto Ricans will suffer the most from the default, not Wall Street, since most of the Public Finance Cooperation debt is held by regular people on the island through credit unions. The government is strategically choosing not to pay this debt because these people are less likely to sue.   6. The economy in Puerto Rico is in dire situation. Unemployment is 12% -- more than double the rate in the United States (5.3%).   7. There's a mass population exodus underway. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are  leaving the island  for the mainland United States in search of jobs and stability. It's being compared to the 1950s ""West Side Story"" era.   8. The Obama administration has no plans to bail out Puerto Rico. They have said so repeatedly. The best hope for Puerto Rico is for Congress to change the law to give the island  Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights  -- something all 50 states have. But the bill in Congress to do that is highly unlikely to pass. Even if it does, the island itself could not declare bankruptcy, only municipalities on the island. Moody's analysts say Chapter 9 rights won't help the current debt situation.   9. It gets worse. In addition to an awful economy, Puerto Rico is going through a real drought, drying up the island's water supply. Locals say the government has been cutting off tap water for two days straight in towns that tourists do not visit. It's a part of a water rationing program the government began earlier this year.   10. Puerto Rico's default is unlikely to trigger any sort of mass bond sell-off. That said,  over 20%  of bond funds in the United States own at least some Puerto Rican bonds, according to data from Morningstar. If the defaults continue, more Americans will be impacted.

144,Puerto Rico Defaults On Debt Payment,"Megan Davies, Jessica DiNapoli",8/3/15,"NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico has defaulted on debt by paying only a fraction of what was due Aug. 1, showing the depth of the island's economic and cashflow problems and potentially opening the door to broader defaults and litigation from bondholders.The U.S. commonwealth paid only $628,000 of a $58 million payment due on its Public Finance Corp (PFC) bonds, the head of its Government Development Bank said in a statement on Monday.""Due to the lack of appropriated funds for this fiscal year, the entirety of the PFC payment was not made today,"" GDB head Melba Acosta said.Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla shocked investors in June when he said the island's debt, totaling $72 billion, was unpayable and required restructuring. The non-payment marks the first default by the commonwealth and is the most notable since Detroit defaulted on $1.45 billion of insured pension bonds before filing for bankruptcy in 2013.""(They are) telling investors they are serious about this debt adjustment,"" said Peter Hayes, head of asset manager BlackRock's Municipal Bonds Group, which does not own any commonwealth-backed debt. ""It may be a precursor to how they make payments going forward if they can't reach amicable settlements with creditors groups.""A default could open the door to a fight with investors. Daniel Hanson, analyst at Height Securities, said in a research note last week that market participants would probably file a lawsuit in San Juan as soon as Tuesday.According to Thomson Reuters data, holders of PFC debt include OppenheimerFunds, Franklin Templeton and Lord Abbett.""We are disappointed that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico did not make its scheduled payment of principal and interest today,"" said a spokesperson for OppenheimerFunds in a statement, who declined comment on the fund's PFC holdings. ""We will vigorously defend the terms of the bond indentures.""Daniel Solender, lead portfolio manager at Lord Abbett, declined comment on PFC holdings but said he hoped Puerto Rico would reconsider the non-payment.Franklin has declined comment about PFC holdings.The price of PFC debt due 2031 fell to a record low ahead of the announcement, which had been well flagged, trading at 7.5 cents on the dollar. It was minimally active with one trade recorded on Monday. That price was down from 15.55 cents on the dollar last week.""I'm not mad, I'm not surprised,"" said Ben Eiler, managing partner of First Southern Securities, ahead of the announcement Puerto Rico would only pay a fraction of the debt.""They're making a strategic default, and they're prioritizing payments, and so they're going to do the ones that are less important first, and that's going to ... strongly influence bondholders to negotiate,"" said Eiler, who personally holds PFC bonds.One institutional investor who requested anonymity said he sold his PFC exposure about a month ago because he was ""nervous they were going to default.""""It shouldn't have taken me so long to come to the conclusion that they were going to default,"" the investor said, noting he was glad he was now out of the position.While Puerto Rico has argued that missing a payment would not constitute default because its legislature is not legally bound to appropriate the funds for payment, credit agencies and investors saw it differently.""Moody's views this event as a default,"" said Moody's analyst Emily Raimes in a statement. ""This is a first in what we believe will be broad defaults on commonwealth debt.""Standard & Poor's said the missed payment presages other possible defaults as liquidity becomes further constrained, and added it would impede the island's ability to obtain financing for cash flow needs. The credit agency lowered its rating on $1 billion of PFC debt following the default to ""D"" from ""CC.""PFC bonds have weaker protections than many other Puerto Rico bonds such as general obligation debt.Also on Monday, Puerto Rico said in a regulatory filing it had temporarily suspended making monthly deposits to its general obligation redemption fund.The decision to skip the debt payment showed the commonwealth was prioritizing its citizens over creditors, investors said.""While the PFC default was widely expected, the failure to appropriate means that the financial crisis in Puerto Rico has entered a new stage, one where the territory is prepared to balance its obligations to its creditors with what it perceives as the public service needs on the island,"" said Thomas McLoughlin, UBS chief investment officer wealth management research.Acosta said the decision reflected ""serious concerns about the Commonwealth's liquidity in combination with the balance of obligations to our creditors and the equally important obligations to the people of Puerto Rico.""Acosta said that PFC made a partial payment of interest in respect from funds remaining from prior legislative appropriations. The funds of $628,000 were applied to the Aug. 1 payment.""A government's primary responsibility is to provide services to citizens,"" said Hayes. ""When you finally make the determination not to pay, you know you're effectively cutting yourself off from the capital markets, but from their standpoint they see it better of two evils.""

219,Puerto Rico just defaulted for the first time,Patrick Gillespie,8/3/15,"Puerto Rico just went into default for the first time in its history.  The commonwealth paid a mere $628,000 toward a $58 million debt bill due Monday to creditors of its Public Finance Corporation. This will hurt the island's residents, not Wall Street. The debt is mostly owned by ordinary Puerto Ricans through credit unions.    
 
  ""This was a decision that reflects the serious concerns about the Commonwealth's liquidity in combination with the balance of obligations to our creditors and the equally important obligations to the people of Puerto Rico,"" Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank president Melba Acosta Febo said in a statement.   The default is a historic moment in Puerto Rico's economic "" death spiral ,"" a term the island's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has used. The island is struggling with about $70 billion in total outstanding debt, and its economy is in recession.   Padilla has put together a team to come up with a plan to restructure Puerto Rico's debt crisis by the end of the summer.     It is hitting people especially hard. Puerto Ricans are leaving the island in droves in search of jobs and stability. Unemployment is high, the economy is shrinking and the future looks shaky.   Omar Rodriguez and his wife left Puerto Rico two weeks ago to move to Austin, Texas.   Rodriguez, 26, is a former government employee and he's never lived outside the island.   He's already got two jobs: one at a restaurant at the University of Texas, and the other as an assistant teacher at a nearby school. His wife is a teacher too.   He admits that starting a new life in Texas will be an uphill battle, but it's better than the uncertainty back in Puerto Rico.   ""I wouldn't imagine having the same quality of life in Puerto Rico at the moment and that saddens me,"" Rodriguez said. ""Saying goodbye to my parents ...it was a bit unbearable.""       On Monday, Puerto Rico had to make a monthly debt payment of $483 million. Puerto Rico paid all its debt due except the $58 million due to creditors of its Public Finance Corporation. The government is strategically choosing not to pay the PFC debt because the entities that own the debt, credit unions and ordinary Puerto Ricans, have little legal power to fight back in court.   ""This is a first in what we believe will be broad defaults on commonwealth debt,"" said Emily Raimes of Moody's Investors Service.   The other debt -- some of which is owned by Wall Street hedge funds and hence has more legal clout-- was paid on Monday.   Puerto Rico has the same amount of outstanding debt as New York. Yet its economy -- worth $69 billion -- is just a fraction of the Empire State's $1.2 trillion.   The economy is also in a big mess. Unemployment is more than double the rate in the mainland United States.   And with Puerto Ricans leaving the island in droves to look for jobs on the mainland, it only shrinks the tax base further, making it harder for the island to pay its debts.    Just when you think it can't get worse, Puerto Rico is going through a bad drought. The government is rationing water.   Rodriguez said his wife's parents -- who live in Trujillo Alto, a town near San Juan -- have gone without running water this summer for two straight days.   Other towns that aren't tourist destinations are going days without tap water too, he said. With the school year starting soon, major questions loom for those on the island.   ""How are you going to teach with dirty bathrooms and no water?"" asks Rodriguez. ""At some point the economy and the way of living in Puerto Rico, it's so bad that you start going crazy.""

145,Puerto Rico's Symbolic Power,"Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",7/31/15,"In Puerto Rico, July is the cruelest month. It opens with an ironic bang on Fourth of July weekend, with U.S. Independence Day also a holiday, despite the U.S. territory having its own independence movement--no fireworks, but plenty of beach, barbecue, beer and boombox. And it closes in layered ironies, as a July 25 local holiday marks the founding of the Commonwealth in 1952, when the U.S. government allowed Puerto Rico to draft its own Constitution, then approved by Congress, often called a pro forma exercise to dissimulate colonialism. For those who bristle at both these holidays, in this deeply divided polity, July 25 also recalls the 1898 U.S. military landing in the southern town of Guánica, and the anniversary of the 1978 political killings of two young independence activists on a mountain called Cerro Maravilla. In the southern city of Ponce, revelers paraded for their basketball team's national title win, capping a week of sports patriotism watching the Pan American Games in Toronto, with 15 medals tallied. And Statehood supporters rallied at the capitol building in San Juan, while the group 33 Mujeres por Oscar picketed at an intersection near the Caribe Hilton, as they do at the end of every month, for the cause célèbre urging a presidential pardon for Puerto Rico's longest-held political prisoner, Oscar López Rivera.The recent media blitz on Puerto Rico's debt woes--billed as the largest potential municipal bond default in U.S. history, and awash with comparisons to the much worse debacle in Greece--has no parallel in modern Puerto Rican history. Not since the popular uprising that ended U.S. Navy bombing exercises in Vieques in 2003, or when four Puerto Rican Nationalists shot up the U.S. Congress in 1954, has this Caribbean island received such international press attention. Since governor Alejandro García Padilla announced at the end of June that Puerto Rico's $72 billion debt was ""not payable,"" the Commonwealth has been under scrutiny, and is now due to miss an August 1 bond payment. July also ended dramatically in Puerto Rico's key counterpoint in the Greater Antilles, popularly called ""two wings of the same bird,"" with the U.S. embassy reopening in Havana on July 20, after a 54-year break in diplomatic relations, soon followed by the July 26 celebration marking the start of the Cuban Revolution. In announcing the momentous shift, President Obama stated that it was time to acknowledge U.S. policy toward Cuba had failed. Shouldn't he now also be admitting the same about Puerto Rico? It would behoove federal policy makers to heed such tensions in this country of 3.6 million U.S. citizens, with another 4.7 million in its rapidly growing diaspora. The second largest U.S. Latino group, Puerto Ricans number a million in the pivotal electoral state of Florida, and stand to surpass Cubans there by 2020. The term Commonwealth seems euphemistic, especially now that a potential humanitarian crisis, civil unrest and disruption of basic services loom. Water service has already been rationed for a million metropolitan area residents this summer, due to a historic drought exacerbated by years of water mismanagement. Better to use the Spanish term Estado Libre Asociado or Free Associated State.Puerto Rico's political status is tied to its debt woes. As a territory, its municipal bonds remain triple tax-free, seen as lucrative, and thus gobbled up by mutual funds. When the bonds were downgraded as the local economy continued shrinking, hedge funds stepped in and now hold one third of the debt. Additionally, Puerto Rico cannot authorize municipal or agency bankruptcies (access was taken away from territories in 1984).Most media coverage notes that Puerto Rico's economy took a hit when corporate tax breaks were phased out in 2006, then worsened with the U.S. recession of 2008. But local analysts argue that by relying on such incentives, a large public sector, and federal transfers, Puerto Rico's economy fomented dependence rather than development, and has been in decline since the 1970s. The island's incessant status debate distracts it from now sending the U.S. Congress a clear message on needed action, argued Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) from the House floor this week.  Still pending at the U.S. Congress is HR870, a bill that would grant Puerto Rico powers to authorize bankruptcy for its public corporations and municipalities, which the Republican-controlled Congress has hardly warmed up to. Also possible is a U.S. Supreme Court challenge after Puerto Rico recently lost a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision on blocking a local law that attempted the same. A reform supported across the local and federal political spectrum, even by the conservative Heritage Foundation, would rescind the 1920 Jones Act cabotage laws, to break an archaic maritime port monopoly that reportedly costs Puerto Rico from $200 milllion to $1 billion annually in inflated shipping costs. Past attempts to do so have been blocked by the U.S. maritime lobby and its unions, as if the country was being straightjacketed. The scramble for bankruptcy protection has echoed calls for equality for so many U.S. citizens, not lost on the presidential candidates in light of the Florida vote.Calls have also been made for federal receivership, from the same forces lobbying against the bankruptcy bill, some financed by the Koch brothers, in cahoots with predatory vulture hedge funds. Many of these vulture hedge funds also hold distressed debt in Greece, Argentina and Detroit, as Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism has shown.This week their hired guns called for cuts to an already stressed public education system--a stark example of the 1 percent targeting half a million children living in poverty on the island. The local government's report, also written by former IMF officials, calls for reducing the minimum wage, with the business press parroting higher welfare versus wage earnings, while willfully ignoring the large underground economy--including the drug trade--which the new 11.5 percent sales tax, the highest in the U.S., seeks to capture. Federal receivership under the aegis of neoliberal fundamentalists should be rejected for what it is--brute colonialism. Placing Puerto Rico under federal receivership is not quite the same as doing so for Detroit. One thing is to override locally elected officials in the U.S. states, and another to do so in a country where rural workers were brutally exploited by U.S. sugar interests the first half of the 20th century, and only elected its first governor in 1948, while independence supporters were persecuted, imprisoned and tortured.With Puerto Rico's chief political parties defined by status--Commonwealth, statehood and independence--obstruction and lack of long-term planning has long plagued governance. While some are so fed up with corruption and clientelism as to unwittingly welcome federal receivership, for others such a measure would be incendiary, and could trigger violence. Better to investigate and prosecute past corruption as a deterrent--and extract debt payment from criminal property seizures. This would include tax evasion, as only 12,500 in the country report earning more than $100,000. In addition, nearly 45 percent of sales taxes are not being adequately collected, to the tune of about $900 million in 2012, before the recent hike. Big tax evaders probably don't feel too guilty in light of Law 22, which puts wealthy Puerto Ricans at a disadvantage to outside investors. Passed by the previous pro-statehood governor, Luis Fortuño, and promulgated now under the current García Padilla administration, the law has turned Puerto Rico into a tax haven for the mega-wealthy, who have been lured to the island with promises of a moratorium on income and capital gains taxes through 2036. More than 500 have moved to the island already, including Toby Neugebauer, son of Texas congressman Randy Neugebauer, and a backer of Tea Party politician Ted Cruz. Local officials openly tout a relaxed view of the 183-day-per-year residency rule, just when New York City grapples with tax evasion linked to luxury real estate. Much like Greek isles are up for sale, websites now advertise ""How to Get Your Own Private Island"" off Puerto Rico. Sotheby's lists luxury properties online that are now being snapped up in Vieques and colonial Old San Juan, a neighborhood considered national patrimony. The most notable purchasing big properties is John Paulson, the mortgage meltdown billionaire.Theories abound that the millionaires arrive in an era of historic population decline by design, also fueling speculation that the Obama administration ignores the crisis because thousands leaving monthly for Florida may benefit the Democratic Party in the presidential elections. In 2012, Florida Puerto Ricans voted 83 percent for President Obama, according to researcher Patricia Silver, well above the 71 percent Latino vote he received nationwide. Perhaps this development helped facilitate the president's rapprochement to Cuba. Ignoring Puerto Rico at this crucial juncture--in all its local and historical complexities--would imperil such support. Now that Puerto Rico is no longer important as a capitalist showcase and U.S. military and intelligence outpost of the Cold War era, are its U.S. citizens expendable? If so, Puerto Rico's crisis announces the end of the New Deal and the American Century. Until now, San Juan was invisible compared to Detroit and Havana, but its latent and tacit symbolic power should not be overlooked. Nor should its significant political voice on the mainland of the United States. Given Puerto Rico's heightened media visibility, no doubt the world now has its eyes on how the United States will respond to the needs of the island, one of the last colonies in the world.Also on HuffPost:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-ricos-symbolic-pow_b_7911668,HuffPost,Liberal
146,4 Reasons Independence Is the Right Path for Puerto Rico,"Maru Gonzalez, Contributor",7/30/15,"Puerto Rico is in a state of emergency. Its public debt, which Governor Garcia Padilla recently declared unpayable, is $73 billion and counting. Unemployment is hovering at a dismal 14 percent and 46 percent of the island's inhabitants are living below the poverty line, a rate higher than that of any state on the mainland. Puerto Rico's recent surge in out-migration is also cause for concern. Spurred largely by the economic crisis, a historic exodus of residents to the mainland translates to a shrinking tax base which, in turn, puts additional strain on an already weakened economy and burdens those remaining on the island with higher taxes and dwindling resources.Although a variety of suggestions have been proposed to save the island from default, here are four reasons a clearly articulated, multi-year transition to independence is the only long-term viable solution for Puerto Rico. 1. Puerto Rico's serious and worsening economy is largely rooted in its colonial status. As a U.S. colony, Puerto Rico's insolvent municipalities and public corporations cannot declare bankruptcy. And because Puerto Rico is not independent, it is prohibited from seeking help from international financial institutions, leaving it with few options in the face of what seems like inevitable default. Yet while the right to declare bankruptcy is important in helping the island restructure its mounting debt, it is only part of a short-term solution to a crisis that is, at its core, deeply structural. Puerto Rico's economy is both limited by and dependent on Washington. Constrained by U.S. federal laws and regulations, the island's economy lacks the structural capacity to thrive on its own. Puerto Rico has no control over its monetary policy and little control of its fiscal policy. Issues related to immigration, foreign policy and trade are dictated by U.S. law and U.S. regulatory agencies. Further, because Puerto Rico has no actual representation in Congress, decisions are made with little to no consideration for the needs and general welfare of the island's residents. Indeed, Puerto Ricans must adhere to laws passed by a government in which they do not participate. Independence would grant Puerto Rico a platform to address the debt crisis on its own terms and afford the island's 3.5 million inhabitants the right to self-determination. 2. Statehood is a pipe dream. Economic and cultural arguments aside, statehood has never been a real option for Puerto Rico. Contrary to Alaska and Hawaii, which were deemed ""incorporated"" territories with the intention of moving toward annexation to the Union, the decision to keep Puerto Rico as ""unincorporated"" was a ploy to avoid statehood. Indeed, Puerto Rico's status as an unincorporated territory means that it ""belongs to, but is not part of the U.S."" And that is unlikely to change. A Republican-controlled Congress would never admit Puerto Rico -- with its massive debt and overwhelmingly Democratic (and non-white, Spanish-speaking) voting base -- into the Union, even if such a determination is made by the island's residents. 3. Other nations have proved that independence is possible. For far too long, the people of Puerto Rico have chosen to accept the comfort of a familiar yet broken status quo over the uncertainty of real, revolutionary change. Indeed, many on the island and in the diaspora adhere to a colonized mentality, one that believes an independent Puerto Rico is economically unsustainable. But liberated nations across Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America have demonstrated otherwise. Singapore is a prime example. With a size 14 times smaller than Puerto Rico, less natural resources, and a significantly higher population density, Singapore has thrived socially and economically since gaining independence -- even exceeding the per capita income of the United States. 4. An independent Puerto Rico would more readily protect the welfare and the rights of its people than the United States. Since the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico in 1898, Washington's relationship with Puerto Rico has been one of exploitation and convenience. From the Ponce Massacre and government-sanctioned programs aimed at forcibly sterilizing working class Puerto Rican women to unethical testing and human radiation experiments on Puerto Rican prisoners, the U.S. government has a shameful track record of transgressions on the island. And let's not forget Vieques: for more than 60 years the U.S. Navy used the island of Vieques as target practice. Though the bombings stopped in 2003, the U.S.' legacy on Vieques continues in the form of destroyed land (over half the island is uninhabitable), shattered livelihoods, and increased rates of cancer, birth defects, and illnesses -- the result of contamination from years of continuous bombings.Yet because Puerto Rico lacks any real autonomy or representation, these and other travesties -- both social and economic -- are largely ignored. Independence would hold accountable elected representatives at all levels of government and restore power to the people.Related links:5 Things Every American Should Know About Puerto Rico's Financial CrisisThe Puerto Rico Debt Crisis, ExplainedWhy Every American Should Care About Puerto Rico's Austerity CrisisAlso on HuffPost:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/4-reasons-independence-is-the-right-path-for-puerto-rico_b_7907434,HuffPost,Liberal
147,Hedge Funds Want Puerto Rico To Fire Teachers To Pay Them Back,Simon McCormack,7/29/15,"As Puerto Ricoteeters on the edge of default, a new report commissioned by a group of hedge funds insists the U.S. territory can avoid bankruptcy if it lays off teachers, sells off many of its public assets and collects more taxes.If the government tries to restructure or avoid paying its debts, it will be sued and the crisis in confidence that follows will make things much worse for the island, an author of the report argues. Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla announced June 29 that the commonwealth would not be able to pay back its $72 billion debt as it is currently structured. He also said Puerto Rico's municipal governments and public corporations should be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Federal law currently excludes Puerto Rico from taking that course of action, though it is open to all 50 U.S. states.Areport commissioned by Puerto Rico's government released that same day recommended debt restructuring as well as cuts in the minimum wage, welfare spending and fewer labor protections. It also argued for further cuts to education, including reducing the number of teachers. García Padillahas rejected many of the recommended cuts.The new report, which was commissioned by 34 hedge funds that own $5.2 billion of Puerto Rico's debt, argues against declaring bankruptcy. Instead, former International Monetary Fund economists Jose Fajgenbaum, Jorge Guzman and Claudio Loser of the Centennial Group recall the previous report and recommend selling off $4 billion worth of public assets and implementing austerity.Over the last decade, spending on education on the island increased by 39 percent, or $1.4 billion, the report found, while enrollment declined by 25 percent as thousands of Puerto Ricans fled for the mainland looking for a brighter economic future.But even at current spending levels, Puerto Rico spends just $8,400 per student, about 21 percent less than the $10,667 per student average in the U.S., The Guardian pointed out. Some 56 percent ofPuerto Rico's children live in poverty.Puerto Rico needs debt forgiveness, not more austerity, said Eric LeCompte, executive director of the religious development organization Jubilee USA Network. Just relying on budget cuts means the ""economy will continue to retract and they will be headed into a downward spiral,"" LeCompte told The Huffington Post.Instead, the territory, where 45 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, needs to have half its debt written off, he argued. The other half needs to be restructured so that payments can be pushed into the future. But the Centennial Group's Loser said that's a dangerous path for the island to follow. There are certain bonds that Puerto Rico is legally obligated to pay back, he said; if it doesn't there will be costly litigation filed against it.Worse, Loser said, not paying what Puerto Rico owes will make investors lose confidence in the island.""Puerto Rico would be filled with lawsuits and a long period of uncertainty,"" Loser said. ""If they say 'we’re not going to pay or respect the contracts we have,' [investors] will say, 'I’m not going to invest here because I’m not sure what’s going to happen next.'""One area where both LeCompte and the Centennial Group agree is tax collection. Both say the territory needs to crack down on tax cheats. Puerto Rico only collects about 56 percent of the sales tax its owed, compared to an average of 83 percent across the 50 states, according to the report.LeCompte said Congress can aid the island by making it legal for its municipalities and public corporations to declare bankruptcy, which could ease Puerto Rico's debt burden and pave the way for growth. In bankruptcy, a court would determine how much of its debt the territory is able to pay; its creditors would take a loss.""One of the best solutions is to be able to declare municipal bankruptcy,"" LeCompte said. ""It’s imperative not only for the territory to raise money through tax revenue but also through debt relief as well.""",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hedge-funds-puerto-rico_n_55b7d844e4b0074ba5a686df,HuffPost,Liberal
148,"For Puerto Rico, Prosperity Requires Equality","Rep. Pedro R. Pierluisi, Contributor",7/28/15,"The press has turned its attention to Puerto Rico in the wake of the recent claim, made by the island's governor, that Puerto Rico cannot pay all of its $72 billion in outstanding debts. Much of the analysis is simplistic and superficial. This is unfortunate, because skewed media coverage can cause policymakers and members of the American public -- some of whom are being introduced to the subject of Puerto Rico for the first time -- to draw erroneous conclusions.  To properly assess the situation, one should ask and answer three questions. First, what, exactly, is Puerto Rico? Second, what are the main causes of the economic crisis in Puerto Rico? And third, what steps should be taken, in both Washington, D.C. and San Juan, to empower Puerto Rico to manage this crisis and, ultimately, to prosper? Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. This is not a unique or special political status; it is the same status that four other smaller U.S. jurisdictions have, namely the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. Puerto Rico is not a sovereign nation. Nor is Puerto Rico a ""commonwealth,"" a word that is frequently used by the press but one that is devoid of meaning.  Puerto Rico's 3.5 million residents are American citizens who carry U.S. passports and can move to the states for the price of a one-way plane ticket. Indeed, over 4,000 of my constituents are now exercising this right every month. Island residents have served in the American military in large numbers since World War I. Nine service members from Puerto Rico have won the Medal of Honor. A mostly Puerto Rican unit of the U.S. Army, the 65th Infantry Regiment, was recently awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its combat performance in the Korean War.  Under the U.S. Constitution, the federal government has nearly absolute power over its territories. Over the years, Congress has delegated to Puerto Rico about the same authority over local matters that the states possess under our system of federalism. For example, in the 1950s, Congress authorized Puerto Rico to draft a state-like constitution and then approved that constitution. Like the states, Puerto Rico has three branches of local government -- a popularly-elected governor, a bicameral legislature, and a judiciary. Every federal agency has a presence in Puerto Rico. Federal law is supreme in Puerto Rico, interpreted by federal judges nominated by the president, confirmed by the Senate, and enjoying lifetime tenure.  Accordingly, if you see an article describing Puerto Rico as an ""island nation"" or ""a Caribbean country"" -- perhaps you ought to stop reading. The reality is that the economic challenges that Puerto Rico confronts are as ""American"" as those faced by California in the early 2000s or by Detroit in 2013.  Puerto Rico is essentially a U.S. state, with two critical differences. My constituents cannot vote for president (although they do participate in presidential primaries), have no U.S. senators, and have one delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives, a position I have held since 2009. I can introduce bills and vote on the committees to which I have been assigned, but I cannot vote on the floor. Puerto Rico thus lacks the most fundamental feature of American political life: democracy. In addition, Puerto Rico is denied equality. As a territory, it can be -- and often is -- treated worse than the states under federal spending and tax credit programs. I enumerated some of the more egregious disparities in a recent op-ed in The New York Times. Puerto Rico is deprived of billions of dollars annually -- money that could be flowing through our local economy -- as a result of this unequal treatment.  If you genuinely want to understand why Puerto Rico is mired in a crisis, but you disregard or downplay the lack of political and civil rights in the territory, then you are missing a core point. As a result of mismanagement by territory officials, Puerto Rico's problems have grown worse in recent years (and therefore attracted more media attention), but it is important to underscore that these problems are longstanding and structural in nature. If you look back 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, you will see that Puerto Rico has invariably lagged far behind the states (and states, not foreign nations, are the appropriate point of comparison for a U.S. territory) based on every economic metric, including unemployment, poverty rate and average household income. Puerto Rico has a debt problem because our government has over-borrowed, and the main reason our government has over-borrowed is to compensate for the lack of federal economic support. In this sense, inequality has bred irresponsibility.  Both of these factors -- lack of equal treatment at the federal level and lack of discipline at the local level -- must be addressed if Puerto Rico is to achieve economic growth and stem the outflow of island residents to the states. Given my current role as Puerto Rico's representative in Washington, let me briefly focus on the reforms that should be made at the federal level to assist Puerto Rico.  I am a strong supporter of statehood for the territory, which is the only way to guarantee full equality for my constituents. In 2012, the government of Puerto Rico held a referendum in which voters expressed opposition to remaining a territory and expressed a preference for statehood. The federal government responded by enacting legislation to enable Puerto Rico to hold the first federally-sponsored vote in history, so we can finally resolve this issue. I expect that this vote will occur in 2017, that voters will reaffirm their desire for statehood, and that Puerto Rico will petition Congress to enact a law admitting Puerto Rico into the Union.  Until Puerto Rico becomes a state, as I am optimistic it will, there is no reason why Congress and the President should not take meaningful steps to improve the territory's treatment under federal programs, including health programs like Medicaid and Medicare, programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit that encourage work in the formal sector, and other social safety-net programs that currently exclude or shortchange Puerto Rico. Congress should also enact my legislation to empower the Puerto Rico government to authorize its insolvent municipalities, specifically its public corporations, to seek relief under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, a power that Congress has granted to all state governments.  In general, proposals designed to narrow the gap between Puerto Rico and the states should be embraced, while proposals that seek ""special"" treatment for Puerto Rico should be viewed with skepticism. Too often, efforts to provide Puerto Rico with different treatment, even if well-intentioned, ultimately harm rather than help the territory. The American citizens of Puerto Rico seek and deserve equality, nothing less and nothing more. Rep. Pedro R. Pierluisi, a Democrat, is Puerto Rico's delegate in Congress.--Related links:5 Things Every American Should Know About Puerto Rico's Financial CrisisPuerto Rico Tourism Industry Lags Rivals, Offers Little Relief From Debt CrisisThe Puerto Rico Debt Crisis, ExplainedAlso on HuffPost:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/for-puerto-rico-prosperity-requires-equality_b_7887636,HuffPost,Liberal
149,"The Puerto Rico Debt Crisis, Explained","Robert Rosenkranz, Contributor",7/27/15,"Puerto Rico is on its way to one of the largest debt defaults in history, right up there with Greece and Argentina. If you want to know what's happening in Puerto Rico, Anne Krueger is where you must start.At 81, the former chief economist for the IMF has written, with two co-authors, a brief but incisive paper that has become the playbook for both the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its creditors. In an earlier piece in the Huffington Post, published on April 14, 2015, I cautioned that Puerto Rico's bondholders were going to have some sleepless nights. Just 10 weeks later, the island's governor, Alejandro García Padilla, announced that the Commonwealth was unable to pay its debts, and would try to negotiate a ""restructuring"" with the bondholders. The Krueger report shows that their worry should not be about whether their bonds will be paid in full and on time -- her analysis shows that is simply not possible -- but rather how big are the concessions they will have to make. Equally important, she outlines the policy errors that are leading to default. Finally, she suggests a way out, using some of the pro-growth strategies of supply side economics. I will summarize the gist of her analysis.The market has lost confidence in Puerto Rico's ability to repay debt. This kind of prophecy tends to be self-fulfilling. First lenders demand super premium interest rates, making debt service more burdensome. Default becomes more likely, and lenders shut off the spigots entirely. This loss of confidence has been driven by economic stagnation, even contraction, and persistent deficits in public finances. These deficits have been worse than investors expected: in part because public finances have been opaque, and in part because budgets were based on wildly optimistic economic assumptions.Moreover the economic stagnation, or contraction, is not merely a result of an economic cycle but of major long term problems that make the island uncompetitive. The government of Puerto Rico has created many of these problems with its own misguided policies, but the Federal government has made a bad situation worse. ""The single most telling statistic... is that only 40 percent of the population -- versus 63 percent on the U.S. mainland -- is employed or looking for work."" Krueger attributes this to a Federal minimum wage which is far higher than unskilled labor earns in competing Caribbean islands, aggravated by local regulations on overtime, paid vacations, and dismissals which are more costly and onerous than on the U.S. mainland. An overly generous welfare system undermines the incentive to take jobs at all: ""One estimate shows that a household of three that is eligible for food stamps, AFDC, Medicaid, and utility subsidies could receive $1743 a month."" That amount is actually higher than the median family income on the island.Energy costs, another key economic input, are also exceedingly high, several times mainland prices. The government's electric utility, PREPA, is inefficient, overstaffed, and technologically antiquated. The Federal government's Jones Act makes things worse by requiring that all oil imports be conducted with U.S. vessels and crews. Indeed, that Act applies to all shipments to and from U.S. ports and drives transport costs generally to uncompetitive levels. Local regulation of rates and licensing for ground transportation adds to the problem.Turning to government finances, Krueger finds that ""the overall deficit is larger than recognized, its true size obscured by incomplete accounting."" Public sector debt has risen every year since 2000, reaching 100 percent of GNP in 2014. One attempt after another has failed to balance the budget, which is based on extremely optimistic revenue projections (on average revenues have been only 85 percent of projected levels). Falling revenues don't drive lower spending: instead the agencies simply fail to pay their suppliers, who are required to wait longer and longer to collect.Lax verification of payrolls aggravates the problem; and deficient accounting masks it. Consolidated reports are dense, hard to penetrate, and not timely (the most recent is for fiscal year 2013). Information on the Treasury's General Fund operations is timely but ""greatly understates the true deficit and the challenge ahead."" It reports on a cash basis (that is, it doesn't count purchases the government has made but not yet paid for as spending) and excludes some 150 government agencies (whose deficits it nonetheless needs to fund with cash) as well as capital expenditures, which also deplete cash balances. It's as if, in budgeting for your household, you omitted credit card purchases, expenses incurred by your children, and the cost of buying a new car.Taking these and like items into account makes the cash situation far more problematic than is generally understood. Similar cash deficits flow from the three big state enterprises (the monopolies for electric power, water and sewers, and highways and transportation), as well as from the Employee Retirement System for government employees (which has no liquid assets at all) and the Teachers Retirement System (which will likely run out of money in a year or two). With all of this cash depletion combined, the government will need to raise nearly 5 percent of GNP to keep operating in 2016 -- a near impossibility in a zero growth economy with no access to new borrowing. Even this bleak picture can get worse if a fully blown fiscal crisis pushes the economy into a sharper retraction.Is there a way out? The report suggests there is, but it must be both comprehensive and ambitious. The Federal Government, the bondholders, and the government of Puerto Rico must all make difficult decisions. The solution must begin with a revival of growth. The key is supply side reforms. The Commonwealth can fix local labor regulations, and eliminate obstacles to doing business. It can bring energy costs down by opening competition for electric generation to new and more efficient suppliers. The Federal Government needs to make welfare payments consistent with local market conditions, suspend the Federal minimum wage, and exempt Puerto Rico from the Jones Act.A major fiscal adjustment is required. Revenue measures should be as growth friendly as possible, and might include VAT/Sales tax and property tax overhauls. Expense measures should include right sizing of education services (PR has more teachers per student than the wealthiest counties on the mainland), a means test for tuition at the University of PR, and elimination of Medicaid benefits in excess of Federal standards. After several years, supply side reforms ought to result in 2.5 percent growth, which will drive increased revenue collections.But even after a major fiscal effort, and a resumption of growth, a large residual financing gap will remain. A comprehensive discussion would benefit from the orderly processes of Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which Congress should extend to Puerto Rico's public enterprises. Bondholders will suffer if the Commonwealth cannot provide essential services, if there is a breakdown of order, or if the economy collapses in the wake of a crisis. They will need to relieve the island of a meaningful proportion of the interest and principal coming due in the next six or seven years. To agree to do that, they will want to be sure that the Commonwealth government is committed to politically difficult structural reforms, and that the Federal government will grant Puerto Rico the required exemptions from regulations that raise costs and stifle growth.Supply side reforms will not be a panacea for decades of bad policy decisions, but they are an essential part of the solution.--Related links:5 Things Every American Should Know About Puerto Rico's Financial CrisisPuerto Rico Tourism Industry Lags Rivals, Offers Little Relief From Debt CrisisThe Curious Case of Puerto Rico, And Why Default Poses A Risk To The U.S.Also on HuffPost:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-puerto-rico-debt-cris_b_7880796,HuffPost,Liberal
220,Puerto Rico avoids default (for now),Heather Long,7/1/15,"Puerto Rico has avoided a July 1 default -- for now.  Many had started referring to Puerto Rico as ""America's Greece,"" but creditors are breathing a little easier now. Puerto Rico had several debt payments to make by Wednesday, and it has made them, according to government statements and spokesmen.    
 
  Puerto Rico paid back $645 million of general obligation bonds as well as $415 million for bonds associated with its troubled electric utility -- known as PREPA. It also managed to pay back a short-term bank loan of about $245 million.   While it's welcome news this week, Puerto Rico still has a huge debt load to repay in the coming months and years. Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro García Padilla has dubbed the payments a ""death spiral"" and indicated it's too much to pay. The island is on the hook for over $70 billion.     ""We cannot allow them to force us to choose between paying for our police, our teachers, our nurses, and paying our debt,"" Padilla said in a televised speech Monday night. ""We have to act now.""   Puerto Rico is putting together a working group to try to figure out a plan by the end of August. The island is also petitioning Congress for the ability to declare bankruptcy, although that is considered a long shot. Under U.S. law, only cities and municipalities can declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy.   In a significant development Wednesday, PREPA announced an extension of a forbearance agreement with its creditors to September 15. That will give Puerto Rico much needed breathing room to try to come up with a workable solution. PREPA is responsible for about $9 billion of the island's debt.   The island's economy has been in recession for nearly a decade. Many residents are moving to the mainland U.S. in search of better job opportunities, which further diminishes the tax base and makes it harder for Puerto Rico to repay its debts.

150,Puerto Rico Deserves Bankruptcy Protection,"Charles Rangel, Contributor",7/1/15,"Puerto Rico is in financial trouble, and everyone knows it. The declaration by Puerto Rico's governor, Alejandro García Padilla, on Monday that the island's $72-billion debt is ""not payable"" was stating the obvious. It was putting Washington on notice that Puerto Rico needs help.The governor is not asking for the federal government to bail them out of this problem. Puerto Rico is only asking for the right to declare bankruptcy, which is the same right that states have. Because Puerto Rico is not a state, it cannot avail itself of the provision in federal bankruptcy law that enables cities like Detroit to restructure its debt in an orderly fashion. Puerto Rico's representative, Pedro Pierluisi, has introduced H.R. 870, the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act of 2015, which would empower the government of Puerto Rico to authorize one or more of its government-owned corporations to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code if they become insolvent. I fully support this legislation and believe that Congress should act on it when we return in July. There are two major reasons to support this legislation. One is that all state governments are already empowered to do this under current federal law. Second, it will not cost a dime of taxpayers' money. When Detroit was in financial trouble, the Illinois legislature allowed them to restructure their debt through bankruptcy. There is no reason that Puerto Rico should not have the same ability to restructure government-owned corporations' debt. Puerto Rico ranks among the top municipal bond issuers in the country. Puerto Rico, with its population of approximately 3.6 million people, has over $73 billion in municipal bond debt. The governor has engaged the stakeholders in restructuring the dire financial situation he inherited, which has plagued the island of Puerto Rico for generations, but the inability of Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy means that some of the investors are not willing to negotiate. They think they have the upper hand. And due to Congress' inaction, they do. This is not a new problem, and investors have been expecting some kind of restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt for a long time. In fact, the statement made by the governor did not impact the bond market. Puerto Rico bonds are not taxable at federal, state or municipal levels in every state in the country. That is why they are highly sought-after and widely held by bond funds. Moreover, the hedge funds have bought Puerto Rico bonds at deep discounts, hoping to make a large profit. Investors should have recognized that investing in the Island, whose per capita debt load far exceeds that of any state in the union, was a dubious risk. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law held a hearing on this bill in February 2015. The support from bankruptcy experts was overwhelming. The bill is not controversial, yet it has not moved in Congress. No one seems to know why Puerto Rico was omitted from the 1984 rewrite of the bankruptcy laws. There is no logical reason that they should have been omitted. Having served on the Ways and Means Committee for decades, I know that we have inadvertently left U.S. possessions out of our laws by accident. We frequently use the term ""states"" not meaning to exclude the U.S. possessions that include Puerto Rico. Whatever happened, Congress should quickly correct this problem. The lack of bankruptcy protection has created an environment of uncertainty that makes it more difficult if not impossible to address Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges and threatens Puerto Rico's economic future. It could take years for negotiations between creditors and the government to solve this problem. This is a tragic situation -- we must not forget that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, and they have been suffering for years. They have seen their living standards cut, and unemployment is running at double the national average. Puerto Ricans are leaving the island to find jobs at an unbelievable rate. The biggest tragedy is yet to come for the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico confronted with soaring levels of poverty. We are not providing financial aid to Puerto Rico; we are just giving them a way to address some of their problems. We owe it to them to act now.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-deserves-bank_b_7708810,HuffPost,Liberal
151,Puerto Rico's Dance With Default Embraces A Fickle Partner: Wall Street,Laura Barrón-López,7/1/15,"WASHINGTON -- Puerto Rico may stave off default by making a last-minute payment to creditors on July 1, but the island’s economic future rests on the whims of Wall Street.Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla threw investors and market-watchers for a loop Sunday when he deemed Puerto Rico “unable” to pay its debts of more than $70 billion. His comments put a spotlight on the island's troubling relationship with investors who own that debt. “One of the real issues there, and this is going to be the crux of the problem, are not only the [bond] insurers, but also some of the hedge funds that got involved,"" said Jon Mousseau, executive vice president at Cumberland Advisors, who spoke in Washington on Tuesday during a panel discussion about economic hardships facing Greece and Puerto Rico.“Most of the hedge funds signed non-disclosure agreements with Puerto Rico so that they can get access to data, and basically bargaining chips in return for loaning them more money,"" Mousseau said. ""That non-disclosure agreement means they more or less have information that we don’t have, and it means that they cannot trade with anybody else other than themselves.” If Mousseau’s description sounds strange, it’s because it is. As Puerto Rico has piled up debt to cover budget shortfalls, it has increasingly turned to private investors for financing. That makes the debt crisis in Puerto Rico different from the one in Greece, where government debt is mainly in public hands. Puerto Rican administrations have managed to continue their access to private capital by striking deals that include an array of stipulations, including preventing the disclosure of details to potential financial competitors. “I’m not sure that’s helping them right now, because they’ve actually wanted to go to Puerto Rico and say we will lend you more money if you do A, B, and C,"" Mousseau added. ""Puerto Rico wants none of that. That includes reducing payroll, cutting benefits, et cetera, and they don’t want to do that.” Garcia Padilla on Monday night defiantly pushed for “shared sacrifice” between Puerto Rico and bondholders -- a position making creditors nervous. Longtime investors in Puerto Rico, including mutual funds Franklin Templeton Investments and OppenheimerFunds, fought the island’s 2014 efforts to restructure debt. Oppenheimer -- with its $4.5 billion exposure to Puerto Rico, according to Morningstar -- let it be known it’s not thrilled about Garcia Padilla’s new plan to restructure.“We strongly believe the Commonwealth has the ability to provide essential services to its citizens, grow the economy and repay what bondholders are due,” Oppenheimer said in a statement on its website. “We are disheartened that Governor Padilla, in a public forum, has called for negotiations with other creditors, representing and including the millions of individual Americans that hold Puerto Rico municipal bonds.”Oppenheimer said it’s “ready to defend” its agreements with the commonwealth. Other firms with deep ties to the island, including BlueMountain Capital Management, aren’t taking chances, hiring law firms like Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, known for aggressive litigation against Argentina on behalf of bondholders. Investors' competing interests have set the tone for handling Puerto Rico's mounting economic woes for the past year. A collective of financial institutions calling itself the Ad Hoc Group, which manages about $410 billion in assets and owns almost $4.2 billion in Puerto Rico debt, a has actively supported congressional action on legislation that would allow Puerto Rico to file Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The group, which includes Fir Tree Partners, Brigade Capital Management and Monarch Alternative Capital, is heavily invested in general obligation bonds. Bankruptcy legislation would benefit the group's investments. But those invested in Puerto Rico's state-owned power authority, for example, argue that bankruptcy would put their holdings at risk. Matt Fabian, of Municipal Market Analytics, said Puerto Rico faces tougher odds than debt-burdened cities on the U.S. mainland. The reason, Fabian said, is hedge funds that have “a lot of conflicting positions.”Fabian characterized Puerto Rico’s situation as “strange,” because investors are more interested in making the value of their holdings increase than in helping the island. Hedge funds are pushing for reforms to help Puerto Rico's economy, Fabian said, but “it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s advice that’s in the best long-term interest of Puerto Rico. It is troubling.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled Matt Fabian's last name.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-wall-street-default_n_7701460,HuffPost,Liberal
152,"The Curious Case of Puerto Rico, And Why Default Poses A Risk To The U.S.",Adriana Usero,6/30/15,"WASHINGTON -- U.S. lawmakers have no firm plan to help more than 3 million American citizens living 1,000 miles off the coast of Florida under a government staring down the barrel of a $73 billion debt crisis.Those U.S. citizens live in the territory of Puerto Rico. Thousands of them are fleeing each month to the U.S. mainland in the search of economic opportunity, compounding the island’s financial crisis.Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla put it bluntly on Sunday, admitting that the island’s “debt is not payable.” Garcia Padilla told The New York Times in an interview that if the government cannot get the economy to grow, Puerto Rico “will be in a death spiral.”Garcia Padilla’s comments come days before Puerto Rico’s government-run electric utility, known as PREPA, must make a $400 million debt payment. The island’s debt, owed to a complex array of creditors, amounts to more municipal bond debt per capita than any American state. PREPA’s payment is just one of many due in the coming months. For residents, the financial troubles mean higher energy bills, a crumbling infrastructure, and a middle class that is fleeing in droves. If the impact on Puerto Rico’s citizenry isn’t enough to spur action by the U.S. government, or by the Wall Street hedge funds that hold a significant stake in the island’s debt, maybe the potential effect of a default on mainland Americans will do the trick. A default by Puerto Rico would roil the municipal bond market -- typically a low-risk arena -- leaving retirement funds, pensions and institutional investors ""massively exposed,"" explained Dante Disparte, founder of the capital management firm Risk Cooperative.“A $73 billion write-off has a potential to bring down many more aspects of the economy than we might let on, because we are trying to treat it like it’s isolated and that it’s an island, but it’s a dollar-denominated economy. It's part of the U.S., and the firms to whom that debt is owed may very well be the firms managing our grandparents' pensions and our own retirement plans,” Disparte said.In Puerto Rico, “what it produces is a tragedy of the commons,"" Disparte, who was born and raised on the island, said in an interview. Every time he visits, Disparte said he sees the effects -- an increasing number of vacant properties.  “When you are playing with things this large and this systemic, you need kid gloves and delicacy and order -- not, ‘It doesn’t matter to me. Let’s just let Puerto Rico fall off the cliff,’” Disparte added. The White House says it's doing all it can to help the island, despite months of remaining relatively mum. In April, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew called on Puerto Rican leaders to develop a “credible” budget for 2016 and a long-term plan to reduce debt.On Monday, after news circulated that Puerto Rico would not have the money to meet the July 1 payment deadline, White House spokesman Josh Earnest played up the administration’s commitment to helping.""There's no one in the administration or in D.C. that's contemplating a federal bailout of Puerto Rico,” Earnest said. “But we do remain committed to working with Puerto Rico and their leaders as they address the serious financial challenges that are currently plaguing the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.”Pressed on possible further action, Earnest cited an interagency task force the administration launched in 2013 to offer expertise to the island’s leaders. Earnest acknowledged Puerto Rico’s inability to restructure its public debt under bankruptcy, as municipalities in the mainland are allowed to do. “So there are strong merits to having an orderly mechanism for Puerto Rico to manage the financial challenges of its public corporation if needed and so we’ve urged Congress to take a close look at this particular issue,” Earnest said, hinting at possible White House support for expanding Chapter 9 bankruptcy to Puerto Rico. “Essentially this means that a Chapter 9 scenario that would be available to all the 50 states is not one that is currently to Puerto Rico, and that is something only Congress can change.”Garcia Padilla remained steadfast in a recorded address broadcast Monday evening, outlining a plan that would allow the island to avoid “choosing to pay police officers and school teachers” or “our debt.” While preaching shared sacrifice, Garcia Padilla made an impassioned pitch for Washington lawmakers to “take concrete action in this crisis. Concrete action now. Action to approve much needed changes to Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code so that Puerto Rico qualifies for the same protections available to other cities or states.” But Congress is nowhere near moving legislation that would grant Puerto Rico the same bankruptcy protection that Detroit used in 2013. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) has said allowing Puerto Rico to use bankruptcy may have large economic consequences and deserves close examination. A committee aide said Goodlatte and other members travelled to Puerto Rico this month to meet with local officials and stakeholders. The committee hasn't met on the issue since February. Former Puerto Rican Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vila said the U.S. government has a responsibility to help Puerto Rico.Acevedo Vila has long defended commonwealth status for Puerto Rico, but has recently argued that the official U.S. position since the 1990s has been to treat the island as a territory. “My argument is look, you have a political responsibility, you have a social responsibility, you have a moral responsibility, but at the end of the day, you might even have a legal responsibility,"" Acevedo Vila said in an interview with The Huffington Post this month. ""Because if the official position is that we are still a territory, and the day comes and we default -- and I’m not arguing that we should default -- I’m saying that that day might come soon, and if that day comes, bondholders are going to sue the government of Puerto Rico for sure, but they might sue the U.S. government.” He added: “I’m not using this argument to threaten the U.S. government. It’s just to create more conscious[ness] that this is also a U.S. government problem, and not just the problem of the people of Puerto Rico, and we all have to sit down and find a solution to this crisis.”Acevedo Vila’s prediction of a default triggering lawsuits is not farfetched. Matt Faber, of Municipal Market Analytics, said things will get more complex and “decidedly uglier” should the island default. Lawsuits already are scattered across the debt landscape. PREPA bondholders, including Franklin Templeton and Oppenheimer funds, sued Puerto Rico in 2014 after the island passed legislation granting the commonwealth the ability to restructure its debt and file bankruptcy. The measure ultimately was struck down in court and is currently on appeal.“There are lawsuits here that would happen almost immediately between bondholders and PREPA, between one group of bondholders and other bondholders, and between bondholders and their brokers-slash-dealers, or whoever bought the bonds for them,"" Farber said. ""So there’s a potential for lawsuits going all kinds of ways. And then because it’s a utility, there’s a potential for court intervention, because bondholders may sue to impose a receiver who would take effective control away from PREPA’s current manager and put it in the hands of someone appointed by the court.” While the storm gathered, analysts like Faber don't see an easy solution. “The status quo has a lot of uncertainty,” Faber said. “It’s hard to see anything different, because it’s hard to see Congress passing a law to impair bondholders in a similar way that the president did with GM bondholders.”In the General Motors bailout, the Obama administration led expansive restructuring, enticing a majority of bondholders to agree to swap GM bonds for a stake in a government-financed iteration of the company paying much lower returns. “They would really need an act of Congress to do much to do really anything that’s meaningful,"" Faber said. “When you have the Republicans who are in charge of Congress are extreme anti-bailout ... there’s almost no chance.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-default-us_n_7692006,HuffPost,Liberal
153,Why Being Treated Like A Colony Makes It Harder For Puerto Rico To Fix Its Debt,Roque Planas & Adriana Usero,6/30/15,"Everyone born on the island of Puerto Rico is a U.S. citizen who enjoys the same rights as any other citizen -- provided they're willing to move to one of the 50 U.S. states.Those who remain on the island, however, are subject to a series of rules that limit their self-determination and participation in U.S. democracy. Despite the fact that Puerto Ricans are full-fledged Americans, the island is neither a U.S. state nor an independent country. The name for its unique status in U.S. law is ""commonwealth."" Yet for all intents and purposes, this political status has granted the island a separate and unequal designation more akin to a colony. Being treated as a possession rather than a partner has made it much more difficult for Puerto Rico to dig itself out from under its more than $70 billion debt. The island is facing a historic default on its debt, which Gov. Alejandro García Padilla said this week is ""unpayable.""Here are five ways Puerto Rico is being treated more like a colony than a U.S. state or an independent country -- making it harder for the island to tackle its economic disaster.  Puerto Rico's political leaders, regardless of party, largely agree that the island should have the same access as U.S. states to Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code -- which allows municipalities and public corporations to restructure their debt or declare bankruptcy. The island's inability to file for bankruptcy makes it much more difficult to renegotiate its debt.The White House at dusk. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)Puerto Rico's lone representative in the U.S. Congress, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, has submitted legislation that would allow the island access to bankruptcy under Chapter 9, but he can't vote on it. Puerto Rico is now an important stop on the campaign trail for presidential candidates to shore up support in mainland Latino communities, yet Puerto Rican voters' influence is limited by the fact that they can't vote for president. If Puerto Rico had the political representation that comes with being a U.S. state, it's likely that both Congress and the White House would pay more attention to the island's issues.Being an island, Puerto Rico has to import a lot of things. But unlike ports across the U.S. mainland, Puerto Rico can't receive ships from foreign countries at its ports. The Jones Act, a 1920 law, instead specifies that shipments to and from the territory must be carried out by U.S. ships with U.S. crews. The law adds an unnecessary layer of inefficiency that contributes to the doubled import costs Puerto Rico pays compared to neighboring islands, according to a report by three independent economists commissioned by García Padilla.Sheets of one dollar bills run through the printing press at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on March 24, 2015, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)One way that independent countries sometimes respond to a debt crisis is by devaluing the national currency. Currency devaluation is generally viewed as a painful last resort, because it reduces the value of people's wages and savings, and opens the risk of sparking out-of-control inflation. But devaluation can also help kickstart economic growth by making exports more competitive and by spurring domestic production by raising the cost of imports. As a U.S. territory forced to use the U.S. dollar, Puerto Rico doesn't have this option. There's one easy way for Puerto Ricans to get all the rights and benefits offered to other Americans: by moving to one of the 50 U.S. states. As U.S. citizens, there's no barrier for Puerto Ricans to leave the island, and many people do. Puerto Rico's population has shrunk consistently in recent years, with a net loss of 48,000 residents per year between 2010 and 2013, according to the Pew Research Center. That level of emigration leaves the island with a dwindling tax base and a smaller pool of workers, professionals, thinkers and consumers to address the island's economic problems.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
154,5 Things Every American Should Know About Puerto Rico's Financial Crisis,Adriana Usero,6/29/15,"Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla finally admitted defeat on Sunday, telling The New York Times that the island could not pay its massive $72 billion debt. Instead of taking on another round of high-interest borrowing to delay the inevitable default, he said it's time for Puerto Rico's creditors to ""share the sacrifices"" that the island's residents have already had to bear.In light of that major development, here are five key reasons why every American should care about what's going on in Puerto Rico. An earlier version of this article was published in May.You might not guess from the amount of media attention the island receives on the mainland -- or from how often the mainland media incorrectly refers to Puerto Ricans living in the states as ""immigrants"" -- but everyone born on the island is an American citizen and holds a U.S. passport. However, the 3.7 million Puerto Ricans currently living on the island aren't eligible to vote for president -- just those who have moved to one of the 50 U.S. states.Like many of their fellow Americans, Puerto Ricans have been vocal in their opposition to balancing budgets on the backs of the poor and middle classes. Earlier this year, throngs of students hit the streets of San Juan to protest García Padilla's proposal to cut some $166 million from the island's public university system -- roughly one-fifth of the system's total budget. The drop in education funding was among the most controversial in a series of deep cuts to Puerto Rico's budget and emblematic of the extreme austerity measures pushed to handle the spiraling debt crisis.Legislation to help Puerto Rico get out from under its debt burden has been proposed in Congress by Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, the island's non-voting representative. The Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act would allow the island's municipalities and public corporations to declare bankruptcy and restructure their debts under Chapter 9 -- something that the cities and towns of all 50 states already can do. But many members of Congress oppose the move as a bailout, even though it would not cost the federal government.Absent an act of Congress, the Federal Reserve is prohibited from lending Puerto Rico money. U.S. Treasury officials and the White House have publicly ruled out aid packages to save the island's government from default, instead advising Puerto Rican officials to just keep searching for ""credible"" financing plans.On Monday, the White House reiterated its anti-bailout position, although it did urge Congress to explore extending financial relief to the island by extending Chapter 9.Some of the biggest stakeholders in Puerto Rico's financial crisis can be found on the U.S. mainland. The island's municipal bonds have been widely traded in U.S. markets due to their triple tax-exempt status -- exempt from federal, state and local taxes, they've been an attractive bet for long-term investors. Despite the growing economic instability and the rumblings of a potential default, investment banks and hedge funds have continued to view Puerto Rico that way. Last year, the island sold some $3.5 billion in municipal bonds even though they were given junk status -- the largest junk-rated municipal offering in history, according to Bloomberg. And earlier this year, Goldman Sachs' asset management division boosted its stake in Puerto Rico's government-run power company, PREPA, from $351 million to $1.3 billion.Visiting Puerto Rico is widely viewed as a way to shore up support among the mainland's increasingly powerful Latino vote. While island residents can't vote for president, nearly 5 million Puerto Rican-born and -descended people live in one of the 50 states, and they enjoy the right to vote. An increasing number of Puerto Ricans are concentrated in the swing state of Florida. So it's no surprise that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) visited the island earlier this year on a fundraising trip, during which he openly endorsed giving Puerto Rico access to bankruptcy protections. While in South Carolina on Monday, Bush again spoke favorably about allowing Puerto Rican municipalities and public corporations to declare bankruptcy, though he also raised conditions. ""I think if Puerto Rico can make a compelling case that they’re prepared to alter the social contract with their extraordinarily large number of state workers and in return for allowing for a reduction, you know, dealing with the debt load that’s unsustainable, where they can start growing economically again -- they’d have to do all three of those things at once -- then giving them that flexibility would be important,"" Bush told reporters. ""That’s why I’ve suggested it about a month ago. I think Puerto Rico has a responsibility now to come up with a plan that makes it serious, a serious plan that people could look at.""Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton also has plans to visit the island this year, according to Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Día.While Puerto Rico's economic situation is more serious than that of the 50 U.S. states, its problems should sound familiar: contraction of the manufacturing sector, weaker job security, difficulty in reversing unemployment, loss of public services and middle class decline.And if certain mainland politicians have their way, Puerto Rico's plight might grow even more familiar. In the past, conservatives on the national stage have touted the island's push toward austerity as a model for making small government work.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the status of Puerto Rico's municipal bonds. They are triple tax-exempt in the U.S. -- that is, exempt from federal, state and local taxes. ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-financial-crisis_n_7689994,HuffPost,Liberal
155,Puerto Rico Governor: It's Time For Bondholders To Share Our Pain,Adriana Usero,6/29/15,"Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla on Monday called for sweeping economic restructuring as the government appears headed toward a default, in comments timed to coincide with the release of a report that showed the island’sdebt is larger than previously believed.Taking his cue from the report, written by a group of independent economists, García Padilla offered a roadmap of broad reforms aimed at partially privatizing some government functions and lowering the cost of doing business on the island, including reducing the level the social welfare benefits provided through the federal government and exploring public-private partnerships to replace some unspecified functions currently carried out by public corporations. The governor stopped short, however, of endorsing a reduction in the island’s minimum wage, as the report recommended. “The private sector, and not the government, should be the principal provider of social benefits,” García Padilla said. “We’re going to create a new entrepreneurial class.” The governor faced massive protests last month after proposing the most austere budget in recent history, including slashing one-fifth of the public university system’s funds. García Padilla backed off, reformulating a new budget plan that included new revenue streams through a proposed sales tax that he said would make it possible to keep servicing the debt. But citing Monday’s report, written by former World Bank Chief Economist Anne Krueger and economists Ranjit Teja and Andrew Wolfe, García Padilla instead concluded that the debt as it stands is “unpayable.” He said the debt would double in 2015 if the government continued to use high-interest bond sales to cover the costs of servicing the debt as currently structured.“The economy is in a vicious circle where unsustainable public finances are feeding into uncertainty and low growth, which in turn is raising the fiscal deficit and the debt ratio,” the report says. García Padilla -- who spoke more than one hour later than scheduled while the live feed organized by his office played assorted public announcements -- said bondholders should share the pain being suffered by the Puerto Rican public as it struggles to make payments on a crippling $78 billion debt. That figure amounts to 100 percent of the island’s gross national product. As a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Rico’s municipalities and public corporations are prohibited from declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 9 -- a benefit allowed within all 50 U.S. states. Legislation submitted by Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, the island’s non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress, would allow Puerto Rico to access Chapter 9. But reform won’t stop with renegotiating the island’s debts with creditors, García Padilla said. While taking pains to highlight that the debt had been assumed primarily by administrations that preceded his, he argued that Puerto Rico needed to make painful financial and structural adjustments in order to get its financial house in order. “It will be difficult,” García Padilla said. “It will take years. But the moment to start is now.” The televised comments came one day after García Padilla said in an interview with The New York Times that Puerto Rico has no way to pay its $72 billion in debts. Puerto Rico’s default would mark a historic economic collapse for the island, but may also help liberate it from what García Padilla called a “death spiral” of selling off high-interest, junk-rated bonds to raise money to cover government spending in a contracting economy with a shrinking population. The bleak report views Puerto Rico’s problems as stemming from a stagnant economy with no growth. The island’s economy has contracted for most of the last decade. Though official data are not yet available, the report’s authors estimate that the economy continued to shrink by at least 1 percent in the 2015 fiscal year, which ended in June. “[T]he drivers of economic decline have been years in the making: the problems are structural, not cyclical, and as such are not going away,” the report says. Among its recommendations, the report calls for labor reform aimed at lowering workers’ wages, stating that current higher wages make local enterprise uncompetitive. The report also recommends reforming the state energy company, PREPA, which the authors call “inefficient” and “overstaffed,” and calls for federal reform of the Jones Act to help reduce the island’s transportation costs. The Jones Act, or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires that shipping to and from Puerto Rico be conducted solely by U.S. ships, excluding international vessels from docking on island docks. Puerto Rico faces a pressing deadline on July 1, when payment on several public corporation municipal bonds and the island’s general obligation bond come due, according to Reuters. Garcia Padilla rallied locals to come together in the midst of the fiscal crisis. “In the past it was easy for government to sweep our problems under the rug. Now is the time to tackle our [financial] problems, and solve our issues once and for all.” ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-default_n_7691348,HuffPost,Liberal
156,Puerto Rico's Top Five Foodie Secrets,"Mark DeCarlo, Contributor",6/3/15,"You might think that Puerto Rico's foodie fame hasn't changed since the Pina Colada was born out of a publicity stunt at the Caribe Hilton's iconic Beachcomber Bar in San Juan in August of 1954 - or was it 1953 - when Roman ""Monchito"" Marrero - or Ramon Mingot - combined Coco Loco with local rum inside a coconut, and got the whole island buzzing - and buzzed. But you'd be wrong.Over the last decade, Puerto Rico has become the Culinary Capitol of the Caribbean. The key to Travel on your Tongue, is ""go where the tourists ain't,"" to find the authentic flavors that will make you drool long after you get back home. You won't find these places on your own. Luckily, I'm here to help. Feed your soul with a Fork on the Road's BEST FIVE FOODIE SECRETS for making your trip to this balmy, sun-soaked island muy delicioso.1)OLD SAN JUAN: Walk, don't drive, through this colonial fort/city. Wind your way along the blue-cobblestoned streets surrounding the majestic Castillo San Felipe del Morro fortress that caps the grassy summit of the city until your stomach starts to rumble. Then meet Caroline or Paulina for their Old San Juan Walk and Taste Tour you booked the night before. You'll meet as a gaggle of hungry strangers at the Totem Telurico in Quincentennial Plaza. After commemorating the 500th Anniversary of Columbus' visit to the island, you'll forage through the Old City, skirting the tourist traps to focus on local chefs and artisans you'd never find without your whimsical guide. Each family-owned café along their route provides it's signature delight; authentic Puerto Rican café con leche, fantastic yucca mofongo, fish tacos, and incredible tres leches, setting the stage for your final stop of the day; a savory lunch of mariscos and rum. Take the tour early in your stay so you can revisit your favorite spots for more comprehensive menu destructions before you leave.2)CONDADO: What does a chain hotel know about local cuisine? Usually nothing. But the comfy beachside Marriott Stellaris Casino and Resort's boss is a former chef who can't help but share his love of local flavor. Chief Hosting Officer - it's on his card - Hans Georg Rohrbein has posted around the world, both as a chef and a GM, and he makes sure that any foodies under his roof in the Condado, just a 5-minute taxi from Old San Juan, benefit from his extensive knowledge for good food, enthusiastically enjoyed. The hotel's pool and white sand beach can be both relaxing and exhilarating, especially if you like water slides. But after lounging awhile, you'll get hungry as the sun sets over the beach. Follow Hans' advice and head to La Placita de Santurce, a short walk south out the front door past a seemingly endless gallery of inventive and pristine street murals. This town square - a Caribbean Rue Bourbon - features live music, a ring of stellar bars and restaurants, and a throbbing crowd of nicely dressed, smiling locals mixing happily with visitors.By 6pm, put your cell number on the dinner list at Jose Enrique, then crowd surf across the packed square to Santaella for some rum cocktails. Guava & Rum is the perfect match for the weekend social scene playing out before you. Part backyard BBQ, part mixer, the crowd at La Placita ranges from sexy singles dancing salsa on the curbs, to couples, to delightfully grizzled Latin geezers, smirking on patios while watching the eternal chase before them.Eventually, your buzzer will light up as much as you do, and it'll be time for hometown chef Jose Enrique to dazzle you with his family recipes. Start with the Poppers, then move onto the succulent Carne Frita and Cangrejo, but make sure to save room for Jose's signature dessert: Tembleque. The ginger-lime, dulce de leche and guava ice creams cool like an ocean breeze on a hot, humid night. Sip your con leche, then head outside to find a dance partner for the live Latin music bouncing around the square. Best nightlife on the Island. Period. Thanks Hans!3)GUAVATE. Drive East and South out of Condado- it's time to road trip and see the countryside. Lush, tropical landscapes line the highways, which are filled with horrible drivers, unless you think driving 40 mph in the left lane is a good idea, in which case, you'll fit right in. The good news: you'll have plenty of time to see the sights. The better news: you're on the Pork Highway to Guavate.Guavate is only 45 minutes out of San Juan, but seems a world away. It's nothing but a string of smoky Lechonera stands. Until around 3pm. That's when the music and crowds roll in. Wander the entire strip, sampling whole hog, chicken, pork tamales, tostones, blood sausage, rice and beans and what ever else caresses your nose as you enjoy great live music...in the middle of the jungle! This pork is worth a 45 DAY drive; you'll never have better pig. Vegans should stay in the car. There's not much, if anything, for them to eat, and who needs all the judgy eyerolls? 4)FAJARDO. Squatting just outside the gate of the luxurious El Conquistador Resort is what was an abandoned gas station, until high profile New York Executive Chef Kevin Roth decided he needed a life on a different island. La Estacion is a casual, classy, extremely friendly bar and restaurant that makes the most of Puerto Rico's native delicacies. The patio is always packed with an eclectic array of tourists, townsfolk and local dignitaries dining on Kevin's inventive mix of Caribbean recipes. His menu is VERY local - exclusively using produce and proteins sourced from his own personally-managed farm - mixing a bit of Manhattan attitude with plenty of island flavor. Start out with the mofongo relleno with Mahi Mahi, shrimp, garlic, onions and peppers. If you're not in a meat coma from the pork highway, get the juicy skirt steak, but only if your date orders the whole fried fish. Fresh doesn't describe the delicate balance of flavors cooked into something that was still swimming while you were driving over. La Estacion has best nightlife on this sleepy side of the island, not counting the nearby Bio-Luminescent Bay, which is the perfect after-dinner excursion. The night-time kayak trip through low-hanging mango trees opens onto one of the few bio-active bays left on Earth. Do not miss this amazing experience for a romantic couple, or a rowdy group of adventurers. 5)EL CONQUISTADOR. After all your rowing, eating and driving, you're gonna need a comfy night's sleep. Proudly perched on top of a massive plot of serenely gorgeous land, sits the Waldorf Astoria's El Conquistador Resort and Golf Course. Priced well within the budget of anyone with enough scratch to buy the plane ticket down, the El Conquistador offers breathtaking views of the water, and it's own private Palamino Island, the perfect spot to snorkel, scuba, jet-ski or just digest every yummy thing you've been sliding down your pie hole. Executive Chef Jonattan Hernandez has won multiple awards for his ancestral Puerto Rican recipes, including leading the National Culinary Team of Puerto Rico to a Gold Medal for his mofongo recipe. It was so delicious, I asked Johnattan to show me exactly how to make it.Puerto Rico is now more than just a pretty face. The island is a World Class Culinary destination... that doesn't act like one. BONUS TIP: Do not come home without a bottle of Ron del Barrilito. They're so local, there's no website. Get the three star and sip it like bourbon. You're welcome.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-ricos-top-five-foo_b_7499370,HuffPost,Liberal
157,Why Every American Should Care About Puerto Rico's Austerity Crisis,Roque Planas and Adriana Usero,5/20/15,"Throngs of students hit the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico, last week to protest Gov. Alejandro García Padilla's proposal to cut some$166 million from the budget for the island's public university system -- roughly one-fifth of the system's total funds. The cuts to the University of Puerto Rico system were some of the most controversial of a series ofdeep cuts envisioned in one of the most austere budget proposals the country has seen in recent years.Despite the large size of the protests and the role they played in prodding the García Padilla administration to rethink the budget cuts, the U.S. mainland media largely ignored the rallies and the austerity debate that prompted them. Here are five reasons every American should care about what's going on right now in Puerto Rico.You might not guess from the amount of media attention the island gets on the mainland, or from how often the U.S. media incorrectly refers to Puerto Ricans living in the states as ""immigrants,"" but everyone born on the island is an American citizen and holds a U.S. passport. However, the 3.7 million currently living on the island aren't eligible to vote for president -- just those who move to one of the 50 U.S. states.  Puerto Ricans living on the island may not be able to vote for president, but how the presidential hopefuls approach the island's situation could play a role in the 2016 election. In one of the first moves of his still-unannounced presidential bid, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush visited the island last month on a fundraising trip. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton also has plans to visit this year, according to Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Día. Though island residents can't vote for president, visiting the island is widely viewed as a way to shore up support from the increasingly powerful Latino vote. Additionally, nearly 5 million Puerto Rican-born and -descended people live in one of the 50 U.S. states, and they enjoy the right to vote. An increasing number of them are concentrated in the swing state of Florida.  Part of the reason behind the García Padilla administration's proposed budget cuts is that the island's government has been borrowing for years to make up for deficits in a shrinking economy. The island's economy contracted for eight consecutive years, from 2006 to 2013, according to World Bank data. Last year, Puerto Rico sold some $3.5 billion in municipal bonds so risky they've been given junk status -- the largest such offering in history, according to Bloomberg. Puerto Rico now faces the looming possibility of default. Those bonds are widely traded in U.S. markets, and a large number of the investors who hold them live on the U.S. mainland.  While Puerto Rico faces more serious economic problems than the 50 U.S. states, some of the trends would seem similar to many Americans: contraction of the manufacturing industry, weaker job security, difficulty reversing unemployment, fewer public services and middle class decline. Nevertheless, some conservatives on the national stage have touted the island's push towards austerity as a model for making small government work.  The Obama administration has tried to keep Puerto Rico's economic crisis at arm's length. U.S. Treasury officials and the White House have publicly ruled out aid packages to keep the island's government from defaulting on its debt. Meanwhile, proposed legislation that would allow Puerto Rican public corporations and municipal governments to declare bankruptcy -- a right enjoyed by the cities and towns of all 50 states -- has yet to gain traction. ""From a bankruptcy policy perspective, I do not believe that the current exclusion ever made sense; it certainly doesn't make any sense now,"" former Puerto Rican Gov. Luis Fortuño wrote in an article last month for The Hill. ""Puerto Rican bonds are heavily traded in the U.S. municipal bond market, so the legal rules should be the same in Puerto Rico as they are in the 50 states.""",[],HuffPost,Liberal
221,"In Puerto Rico, Jeb Bush pushes for statehood",Ashley Killough and Terence Burlij,4/29/15," Jeb Bush reiterated his support for Puerto Rico statehood on Tuesday, telling a crowd that he's long been a backer of the movement to make the U.S. territory the 51st state. The former Florida governor and likely presidential candidate made the comments during a string of public events on the commonwealth, where he spent months campaigning for his father, George H.W. Bush, during his failed 1980 presidential campaign. ""Puerto Rican citizens, U.S. citizens, ought to have the right to determine whether they want to be a state. I think statehood is the best path, personally,"" he said at Universidad Metropolitana de Cupey in San Juan. ""I have believed that for a long, long while. I'm not new to this."" With its primary awarding delegates, Puerto Rico is a popular stomping ground for presidential contenders. Mitt Romney picked up 20 delegates in the commonwealth  during his primary battle  with Rick Santorum in 2012. Bush, who is fluent in Spanish and whose wife is from Mexico,  spearheaded his father's campaign in Puerto Rico  back in 1980, helping him win the primary. The push for statehood remains the biggest political flashpoint regarding the commonwealth. Proponents say statehood will help grant Puerto Rican citizens more rights and benefits as the 51st state, while opponents say it will increase their tax bill and dependence on the U.S. government. Most Puerto Ricans are exempt from paying federal personal income taxes.  In November 2012, nearly 54% of voters in Puerto Rico voted in a nonbinding referendum to change the commonwealth's relationship with the United States. Asked in a second question what kind of political status Puerto Rico should have, 61% chose statehood, while 33% chose the semi-autonomous ""sovereign free association"" and 6% for outright independence. But final approval for a move toward statehood must come through Congress.  Bush said the next president should ""use their influence"" to make sure Congress takes an up or down vote on statehood. ""This should be a question of self-determination,"" he said. ""That's just a question of principle and morality, I think. It's not a question of politics."" The Obama White House says the political status of Puerto Rico should be self-determined and proposed in its 2014 budget that $2.5 million go toward helping the commonwealth hold another referendum on the matter. Bush has indicated he'll make his ties to Latino communities a main staple in his potential campaign. On Sunday, he had lunch in Miami with Zeus Rodriguez, the president of Hispanics for School Choice in Wisconsin, who was selected in a contest to eat with the governor. Following his trip to Puerto Rico, Bush heads to Houston to address the National Christian Hispanic Leadership Conference.  Speaking in both English and Spanish, Bush grew nostalgic about his days stumping for his father in Puerto Rico and suggested he would make a big play for the commonwealth.  ""I learned how to organize intensely, here. I learned the passion. I learned how to drink a lot of Puerto Rican rum,"" he told reporters. ""I had a blast. It was great.""",https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/28/politics/jeb-bush-puerto-rico-statehood/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiE66Dv2sj6AhU1RDABHbkPDHk4UBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw25RMhHRxFt-OF3AhkKO70s,CNN,Liberal

Thankfully, due to Snowmageddon this year, I finally cottoned on to our cousin in the Caribbean. Now that I've drunk the Kool-Aid, I'm bound and determined to get everyone there -- if only so that when people ask me, ""Where should I go for a quick, easy, cheap getaway?"" (this happens all the time) I can point them to this article.Here are five reasons you really should go now. - WATCH the video - it fully illustrates everything!1. It's cheap and easy.Most major airlines fly there, including JetBlue, and the price of a ticket can be up to $200 cheaper than a flight to Miami. Bonus: If you live on the East Coast, it's quick. From JFK airport, for example, it's only three and a half hours to San Juan, which is just slightly longer than a flight to Miami. Related: How to Go Full Local in Puerto Rico2. You can vacation like J.Lo at half the price.The hotels in San Juan are some of the chicest I've ever seen. Jennifer Lopez stayed at Hotel El Convento -- the Chateau Marmont of the Caribbean, located in the heart of the Old City -- which has weekend rates starting at less than $500 a night. If you want to bump up the price a bit, check out the Condado Vanderbilt. The recently refurbished hotel was built in 1912 by Frederick William Vanderbilt in a Spanish revival style, and has been the height of luxury ever since. Rates start at around $300 a night -- expensive, but still a fraction of the cost of a luxury hotel in Miami.3. History, history, history!While the beach is nice, it's even nicer that if you need a break, there's actually something else to do.

The food and drink on the island is to die for -- seriously.You have to work pretty hard to find bad food and drink in Puerto Rico, especially out in the smaller cities, where fresh fish and a cerveza will set you back just $8. In San Juan, my favorite lunch spot is Café Tresbé, a converted shipping container-turned-eatery, which serves the best fish tacos I've ever had. For dinner, check out Jose Enrique, a James Beard-nominated restaurant whose homemade sausage, seafood, and desserts will have you salivating for months afterward. For drinks, stop by craft cocktail bar La Factoria and ask for Mario, who can make you a perfect El Presidente or cocktail made with Sriracha (my favorite). On the wagon?

Yet more than 100,000 people are calling for the removal of Puerto Rico's governor anyway, and one interpretation of the U.S. Constitution could mean they have the law on their side.A White House petition demanding the federal government depose of Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García-Padilla has accumulated 104,000 signatures since its Feb. 18 inception. The primary complaint about García-Padilla, who took office in 2013, is his promotion of the passage of value-added taxes on products between the time that a good arrives in the island and the time that it is sold to consumers. Compounding García-Padilla's unpopularity is his decision earlier this month not to defend Puerto Rico's same-sex marriage ban in court, a move harshly opposed by much of the deeply religious, Catholic island.The Puerto Rico petition recently reached the threshold number of signatures necessary to trigger a response from the White House. The administration has not formally replied yet, though there is likely a slim-to-none chance that President Barack Obama would actually go forward with García-Padilla's removal. On the surface, the petition may seem unserious, along the lines of the viral petition requesting the U.S. government construct a ""Death Star.""Still, it's possible the government could carry this request out if it wanted to, according to an interpretation of Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution. The relevant portion reads: ""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.""The word territory is key here. Clearly the government cannot remove a duly elected state governor, but Puerto Rico could be a different story, at least in theory. In fact, there is some precedent. Between the U.S. annexation of the island in 1898 and the 1947 congressional passage of the Elective Governors Act, the president appointed and removed local governors in Puerto Rico. And the president has removed the governor on a whim on at least one occasion, when Franklin D. Roosevelt removed Blanton Winship in 1939 over concerns about widespread crime and corruption.""Unless Congress revokes the 1947 and 1952 laws [Puerto Rico's Constitution], the president (acting on behalf of Congress) does not have the power to remove the governor,"" said Charles R. Venator, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut's Institute of Puerto Rican and Latino Studies. ""However, because Congress has not changed the territorial status of Puerto Rico since 1900, it is possible to make a theoretical argument that Congress has a plenary power to intervene in local Puerto Rican affairs and remove the governor.""This also brings up the thorny question of whether the island is officially a territory at all. The land was never formally incorporated following its annexation. A 2008 Puerto Rico court decision ruled that it had ""evolved"" into an incorporated territory over the past century, despite any affirmative language from the federal government specifically declaring it. However, the ruling has yet to be upheld or confirmed by Congress or the Supreme Court.The petition's creator -- a Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, resident listed under the pseudonym G.G. -- wrote on the petition's description that ""His [García-Padilla's] administration is a threat to the economy and the people of Puerto Rico -- even to democracy. Puerto Rico doesn’t need an electoral process, it [needs] an impeachment process. The time is ripe for an investigation and action, over what has been done with the people’s money over the last two years.""The Puerto Rico governor's office did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-governor_n_6951090,HuffPost,Liberal
160,Puerto Rico Will No Longer Defend Gay Marriage Ban,Reuters,3/20/15,"SAN JUAN, March 20 (Reuters) - The Puerto Rican government will no longer defend a law that bans same-sex couples from marrying and does not recognize the validity of such marriages performed in other jurisdictions, the U.S. commonwealth's attorney general announced on Friday.The announcement coincided with the filing of a government brief before the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, where the Puerto Rico law is being challenged.The Caribbean island, which is a U.S. territory, said it would no longer defend Article 68 of its Civil Code which contains the same sex marriage rules.""The decision recognizes that all human beings are equal before the law,"" Justice Secretary César Miranda said. ""We believe in an equal society in which everyone enjoys the same rights.""The move paves the wave for the recognition of gay marriages in Puerto Rico, and was welcomed by gay singing star Ricky Martin, who is beloved in his native Puerto Rico.""Today is a great day for my island,"" Martin said in a Twitter message. ""My heart is beating out of my chest. How proud I am to live in a country of equality.""Gay marriage bans have been toppled in a growing number of states following a Supreme Court ruling two years ago that invalidated a federal law that restricted benefits to heterosexual couples.Oral arguments are scheduled before the U.S. Supreme Court next month on the constitutionality of gay marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, a Democrat who is a practicing Catholic, said in a statement that the spread of laws in several U.S. states had pointed to an ""undeniable consensus that does not allow discriminatory distinctions as that contained in our Civil Code with respect to the rights of same sex couples.""""Everyone knows my religious beliefs but political leaders should not impose their beliefs,"" said Garcia Padilla, who has defended the traditional definition of marriage in the past.The decision by Puerto Rico came on the last day that it had to answer arguments presented by five same sex couples and the group Puerto Rico Para Tod@s, who were appealing a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Juan Perez Gimenez last October that dismissed their lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.

161,Puerto Rico: Paradise Lost,"Richard Finger, Contributor",3/2/15,"Puerto Rico labors under a debt load so burdensome it is little more than a patient on life support. The official public debt burden stands at $73.5 billion but there are an additional $38 billion of unfunded pension and public healthcare liabilities*. ""El Nuevo Dia,"" the islands leading daily, recently advertised total indebtedness to be $167.43 billion. This includes adding the interest on the debt. Although this calculation is open to debate the debt problem is plenty bad. The debt addiction has left the island beleaguered and enervated with little political will to reform a society where half the population is on welfare and real GNP has contracted every year but one since 2006. No wonder Puerto Rico has for years been suffering steady emigration (think population declines) to the mainland, further contracting its potential tax base. Unemployment remains over 14 percent (actually down from 15 and 16 percent) and the poverty rate (41 percent) is twice that of America's poorest state, Mississippi. The per capita indebtedness is over 10 times the average of individual mainland states.There is some palaver suggesting Puerto Rico's issues are not insurmountable. Government payrolls have been reduced by 35,000, and Governor Padilla has made numerous spending cuts with hope that the 2015 budget will be in balance or close to it for the first time in years. This is but a gesture and doesn't begin to address the necessary change in the ethos of the people of Puerto Rico. Fewer than one million of the 3.5 million people have regular jobs and one quarter of the overall workforce is employed by the government. Mr. Justin Velez-Hagan, Executive Director of the National Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce, estimates up to 40 percent of the island economy is underground or informal. Mr. Velez-Hagan comments, ""Unfortunately, it has become culturally accepted to receive welfare. People want to work but it can be very difficult to weave through the labyrinth of bureaucracy to open any new small business... so this is what has evolved. In 2010 I investigated opening an assisted living facility for senior citizens. Between the new business licensing and registration process, the multiple bureaucratic layers among competing jurisdictions (state, municipality, city), which can take months or years to issue necessary construction permits , it would have taken me over 5 years for to open my business."" Mr. Velez Hagan continues, ""Entrepreneurship has dramatically slowed, and the incentive to open a business that depends on the local economy is weak. The government definition of reform is to enact laws that give tax breaks for big multinationals to locate here while providing few incentives for the local population.""What Mr. Velez-Hagan suggests is largely true. Until its recent expiration, Section 936 of the internal revenue code exempted U.S. corporations from paying federal income tax on profits generated by a qualified Puerto Rican subsidiary depriving the U.S. Treasury of billions in lost revenues. Multinational drug companies Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and Merck all have a Puerto Rican presence albeit smaller since the lapse of the 936 tax break. In the past couple of years the legislature has passed Tax Act 20, Tax Act 22, and Tax Act 273. These are all aimed at attracting wealthy individuals or export businesses to relocate to Puerto Rico. Act 22 exempts individuals 100 percent from payment of any taxes on any passive income, including dividends and any interest received. The other laws allow qualified corporations a 4 percent income tax rate while local corporations are trapped paying rates as high as 30 percent. So while Puerto Rico has had success attracting drug companies and certain high tech industries, the whole thing is held together with bubble gum. Though the economy remains around 45 percent manufacturing based, thousands of these high paying jobs have deserted the island as tax breaks have expired. Currently many more Puerto Ricans reside on mainland USA than on the island. From April 2010 through July 2014 Puerto Rico's population declined by over 177 thousand people and by the end of 2015 is expected to reach 3.45 million, the lowest in a century. If this exodus continues to follow recent trends, the U.S. Census Bureau projects only 2.3 million souls residing on the island by 2050... a demographic nightmare. If this disaster scenario occurs, the tax base would be so eroded that it becomes a mathematical impossibility for the island debt to be repaid.The last time Puerto Rico tapped the debt markets was in March 2014 at which time $3.5 billion was raised with an 8.72 percent coupon rate. It was about one month after much of the islands debt was relegated to junk status by the Standard & Poor's rating agency. Fast forward and island finances are in a far more parlous state today. And just last week both S&P and Moody's downgraded, even further into junk territory, $48 billion of Puerto Rico's General Obligation Bonds, warning of possible default in the next two years. Cash balances are precariously low, a $2.2 billion Highway Authority debt must be repaid, and now Puerto Rico is forced yet again to genuflect before capital markets and ask for $2.9 billion to be collateralized (repaid) from yet another in the ad nauseam litany of new taxes; this one just approved in January raises, by 68 percent, an existing levy on barrels of crude oil. After this most recent debt downgrade, what rate will be necessary to entice the municipal bond funds to own this paper? Ten percent... 11 percent... who knows? For decades mutual funds and other financial institutions have been lured to finance politicians profligacy due to the islands so called triple exemption from local, state, and federal taxes.  The current official 2015 budget for the island is approximately $9.5 billion. Imagine having to refinance $40 or $50 billion of outstanding bonds and replacing interest rates of 2 and 3 percent with rates of 10 percent or more. Then suddenly over half the overall budget goes to paying debt service. Unless and until Puerto Rico can adopt policies that encourage local growth unimpeded by mounds of stifling regulations the vicious cycle will continue: Lack of job opportunity results in emigration (or operating in the shadow economy), which reduces the tax base, making it harder and harder for the island to repay its obligations. With a stagnating economy and scarce employment opportunity, politicians enacted a $1.36 billion potpourri of new taxes in 2013. And now, on the back of the new crude oil tax, Governor Padilla remarkably has the gumption to propose a 16 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) claiming it can raise an additional $1.6 billion. The local citizenry is basically forced to form an underground economy to survive what amounts to little more than a confiscatory regime.Like the rat trapped in the corner, Puerto Rico is going to backdoor measures to abjure portions of their obligations. A recently passed ""Recovery Act"" attempted to allow some of the government agencies, (think, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)), to be ""eligible for court supervised restructuring."" This is longhand for bankruptcy. Rightly or wrongly, Puerto Rico is not allowed, like mainland states and municipalities, to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy which would allow a restructuring of debts. So a Federal judge quickly rejected the ""Recovery Act"" on grounds that it violated the constitution, reasoning state governments cannot modify municipal debts. Legal challenges will certainly follow, so this issue is far from settled. PREPA is currently rated Caa3, which translates to a high likelihood to default on over $9 billion coming due. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority and the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority also sport debt ratings deep in ""junk"" territory, implying significant risk default. So the situation is dire, and there is no place else to kick the can. As often happens in our no responsibility world, Congress is stepping into the void and over the next few days will debate the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act of 2014, which as the name implies would vouchsafe to Puerto Rico the right, (privilege) to declare bankruptcy.Assuming this bill becomes law, in a matter of nanoseconds Puerto Rico will avail itself and be under a court supervised Chapter 9 proceeding. If we use the Detroit bankruptcy debacle as a guide, here is what may happen to current bondholders. Interestingly, tax supported General Obligation (GO) bonds took big hits, some issues getting less than 50 cents on the dollar. Investors lost billions. Also, when a majority of investors voted for settlement the minority suffered a ""cram down"" and was forced to accept. Detroit's dedicated revenue bonds, like the$2.9 billion issue proposed to be backed by the new crude oil tax continue to be paid in full. The troubling thing to me is that, allowing a Chapter 9 for Puerto Rico, changes the rules in the middle of the game. Investors placed their bets with one set of laws and now they might (unfairly in my opinion) be subject to new rules. In a society with true rule of law, bond covenants should remain sacrosanct.At the end of the day, no amount of debt forgiveness solves the structural problems facing Puerto Rico. Until the state bureaucracy is dismantled Puerto Ricans will continue to flee to the mainland. Meanwhile, stay away from any investment in Puerto Rican bonds. They are hazardous to the pocketbook.* From the Puerto Rico Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-pardise-lost_b_6769950,HuffPost,Liberal
162,7 Reasons to Visit Puerto Rico with Kids,"MiniTime, Contributor",1/15/15,"Located in the Caribbean between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, Puerto Rico is a tropical family vacation destination with year-round sunshine, picturesque beaches and an array of family-friendly activities. The capital of San Juan is a bustling port city steeped in history that goes back to Christopher Columbus' arrival during his second voyage in 1493. Although Puerto Rico is a fairly small island -- about 100 miles long and 35 miles wide -- it consists of several different eco-systems, such as rainforests, mangrove forests and coral reefs. Getting around in the popular tourist areas of San Juan, Condado, Miramar and Isla Verde is a snap with public transportation. To reach the island's interior, easily book a tour.Additionally, hotels are ample and affordable. Just five miles from the airport, the laid-back luxurious San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino (1309 Ashford Avenue, San Juan; 787-722-7000) is located on pristine Condado Beach in a residential neighborhood. Walk to stores, restaurants and a nearby park where you'll hear a chorus of coqui frogs. Beach amenities include complimentary chairs and umbrellas. Ride boogie boards and splash in the gentle surf. The hotel's two-level pool has an area for kids. There's a water slide, fountains and shallow area. Families can rent bikes for free for two hours ($7.50 per hour thereafter). From the Marriott to San Juan is about a 15-ride drive. There's a bus stop around the corner (75 cents one way per person). Taxis are about $15 one way. Here are 7 reasons why Puerto Rico is an excellent choice for a family vacation: No passports necessary! Since Puerto Rico has been a US territory since 1898, American citizens don't need a passport to travel to this exotic getaway. Spanish and English are the official languages and the US dollar is the currency. Caribbean beaches -- does it get much better? Silky white sand and comfortable ocean temps make for perfect family days at the beach. Pristine Condada Beach is great for families. Need sand and water toys. CVS and Walgreens are right around the corner. Huge fortresses. Kids will go wild scampering through the tunnels, dungeons, barracks and outposts of the 16th-century El Morro and 18th-century Castillo de San Cristobal forts built to protect Puerto Rico from invading countries. To see both in one day, start with El Morro and either walk or take a free town shuttle to Castillo de San Cristobal.Explore Old San Juan. Wear comfortable shoes for walking on blue cobblestone streets and exploring plazas, shops and museums.Hike in a rainforest. The El Yunque Forest is less than an hour from San Juan and is lush with plants and waterfalls. Hike in the National Caribbean Forest among 1,000-year-old trees and bamboo groves where you'll hear tiny coqui tree frogs sing (but they're almost impossible to see!). If you're lucky, you might spot the endangered Amazona Uttata parrot. Catch the view from Yokahu Lookout Tower, walk to La Mina Falls and take a dip in the natural pool below (chilly but refreshing!). It's an outdoor playground. Zip lining and bike riding are fun family activities. Soar over treetops, valleys and streams. Or rent bikes for a guided tour and history lesson of Old San Juan. Visit Bioluminescent Bay in Fajardo. On an evening kayaking excursion you'll see tiny star-like bioluminescent plankton glowing in the water. (MORE: Find affordable kid-friendly resorts to stay in Puerto Rico.) Treat your palate to tasty cuisine. Yummy Puerto Rican dishes include mofongo (plantain-based dishes), empanadillas plus bacalaitos (fried codfish fritters), tostones (fried plantain slices), fresh fish tacos and stuffed avocado.

163,The Global Search for Education:  What do Finland and Puerto Rico Have in Common?,"C. M. Rubin, Contributor",11/14/14,"""Prompted by the Global Search for Education series, a survey was designed and responses were obtained from 53 female and 78 male students at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez campus, with the aim of exploring gender perceptions."" -- Hector Rosario and Dan McGeeWhen gender perceptions and negative stereotypes towards women in mathematics and science are non-existent, the gender gap in performance seems to disappear. That's the lesson to be learned from not just Finland, but also Puerto Rico where females are performing as well as males and better than males in some math and science subjects. What we in the mainland US could do to improve girls' image of themselves and boys' image of girls would seem to be the next important question. I invited Dr. Hector Rosario and Daniel McGee to share their fascinating research and perspectives on this topic in The Global Search for Education. Hector Rosario is a professor of mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico (Mayagüez) and holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University. He is a co-editor of Mathematics and Its Teaching in the Southern Americas, an anthology of the history of mathematics education in 17 nations in the Americas. Daniel McGee worked 18 years at the UPR-Mayaguez where he directed numerous projects involving developmental mathematics, high school mathematics, pre-service teacher training and materials for Pre-Calculus and Calculus classes. He is currently director of the Kentucky Center for Mathematics.""There is clearly no evidence with this population to indicate that fathers are considered more intelligent or more talented in math and science than mothers."" -- Hector Rosario and Dan McGeeWhat is the status of the gender gap in Puerto Rico regarding Math and Science achievement and how does this compare to the U.S.?The following quote appears in the chapter on Puerto Rico of the recently released anthology Mathematics and Its Teaching in the Southern Americas.U.S. Information ""The universality of hard-working moms seems to have changed cultural perceptions among college-bound children - particularly among male students who, interestingly enough, seemed to take negative gender perceptions very personally.""-- Hector Rosario and Dan McGeeWhat do you believe are the primary factors driving this improved gender equality?There is evidence supporting gender perceptions and negative stereotypes as major contributors to the gender gap in mathematics and science in the United States. As a similarly large gender gap is not found in Puerto Rico, a good first step is to look at Puerto Rican perceptions of women in science and mathematics. Prompted by the Global Search for Education series, a survey was designed and responses were obtained from 53 female and 78 male students at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez campus, with the aim of exploring gender perceptions.When remembering their childhood, boys tended to remember thinking that boys were more intelligent, harder working, and better at math and science than girls, while girls remembered thinking that girls were more intelligent, harder working, and better at math and science than boys. Perhaps the most telling indicator of student gender perceptions related to how they perceive their parents.There is clearly no evidence with this population to indicate that fathers are considered more intelligent or more talented in math and science than mothers.However, there is an overwhelming perception that mothers are harder working - a sentiment especially strong in boys.So there appear to be neither discouraging gender perceptions nor negative stereotypes among college-bound boys and girls in Puerto Rico. This would certainly support previous research indicating that these are major factors behind the gender gap in the United States. U.S. Information""It would seem that the US could have a large return if it invests in improving girls' image of themselves and boys' image of girls as mathematically and scientifically capable of climbing equally great heights."" -- Hector Rosario and Dan McGeeWhat, if any, specific strategies were used to improve girls' performance in mathematics? Are there any plans to build on this success?While a difficult strategy to replicate, the universality of hard-working moms seems to have changed cultural perceptions among college-bound children - particularly among male students who, interestingly enough, seemed to take negative gender perceptions very personally. In an open comment section of the survey, boys were very prone to speak almost movingly of women scientists and mathematicians that influenced their lives. Girls, on the other hand, appear to be influenced by strong women in their family that have told them of past injustice and instilled the determination to study the career they wish to follow. What can the rest of the United States learn from the Puerto Rican example?When neither men nor women buy into gender perceptions and negative stereotypes towards women in mathematics and science, the gender gap seems to naturally diminish. Hence, it would seem that the US could have a large return if it invests in improving girls' image of themselves and boys' image of girls as mathematically and scientifically capable of climbing equally great heights.For more informationDan McGee, C.

Frankie currently lives in Dallas, Texas, but was born in Puerto Rico and frequently visits today. When he's away, he enjoys teaching first-time visitors about the country's beauty, people and culture, while making recommendations on the best places to stay, see and eat, even if it's just for the weekend. I was born in the small town of Ceiba in the northeastern corner of the island, but I consider all of Puerto Rico my home. When reminiscing about Puerto Rico, it's not just the beautiful beaches, the cool ocean breeze and the mystical El Yunque rainforest that keep tight reigns on my heart. It's also the history, the culture and the people that make up the island that is so aptly nicknamed ""The Star of the Caribbean."" Even though I live full-time in Texas today, I always look forward to my future visits back home and frequently reminisce about my childhood summer trips.My family is spread across San Juan, Cataño and Bayamon. When I was a boy, we would start the weekends at Luquillo Beach, one of the largest beaches on the island. We'd enjoy relaxing with great food before taking a dip in the warm ocean water. You never forget a great beach day in Puerto Rico - even though they are not hard to come by. Aside from playing in the sand, I often used the weekends to explore small towns. In particular, Old San Juan, which is deeply rooted in the island's history, comes to mind. For nearly 400 years it has expressed itself through gorgeous Spanish architecture on ornate cobblestone roads. It is there that you will pass the famous El Morro Fort, a 16th-century Spanish citadel stronghold that kept pirates and invading naval ships at bay. Beyond Old San Juan, on summer weekends I remember venturing to the small town of Guavate. Local restaurants across both sides of the mountain roads were set preparing traditional roast pork that filled the air with sights and smells beyond words. In combination with the famous pork, rice and beans, chicken, sweet plantains and sweet potatoes were always ready for those looking to savor authentic Puerto Rican cuisine. After dinner, the dance halls were filled with music as the young and old hit the floor with rhythmic sounds of Salsa, Merengue and Bachata music that fueled them through the night. No matter where you go in Puerto Rico, there is always a gathering of locals and travelers from abroad getting together to share their love of good times and good food. It's the island's diversity and sense of community that allows this. A mix of Spanish, African and Taino, a native island descent, culture inspires visitors to share in the island's rich identity. My first child will be born soon, and I cannot wait for him to experience Puerto Rico and introduce him to his family back home and let him live his heritage. I'd like to start by taking him to Old San Juan to explore its colonial history, to listen to beautiful music and to see the colorful art and architecture of our people. Beyond that, I want the island to take him away, setting him forth to create his own memories that he can pass to his children. I hope he grows to love Puerto Rico and keeps it close to his heart, because I certainly do and always will.Puerto Rico, I love you.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
222,Congressional investigator seeks answers on Puerto Rico tax deal,Chris Frates,7/11/14,"As Puerto Rico struggles with a massive debt crisis, a top congressional investigator has questions about the island government's decision to nullify an agreement that would have returned about $230 million in overpaid taxes to a major bank. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa sent a letter last month to Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla asking for a briefing on his administration's decision to unilaterally nullify the agreement between the Puerto Rico Treasury Department, known as Hacienda, and Doral Financial Corporation, the second largest mortgage provider on the island. Doral has said the Padilla administration's decision to pull out of the agreement could hurt its financial condition.  Because Doral Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Issa wrote that the Puerto Rican Treasury's ""actions place federal dollars ... at risk.""  ""To enable the committee to better understand the nature of this risk, and the consequences of Hacienda's actions, I respectfully request that appropriate Puerto Rico administration officials provide a briefing to committee staff,"" Issa wrote.  Read Issa's letter (PDF) Issa's letter comes as Doral battles Puerto Rico for a $230 million tax refund it says it's owed. After Puerto Rico decided not to refund the money, the FDIC essentially told the bank it could no longer count the $230 million toward its capital requirements.  Deadline imposed The regulator gave the bank 120 days to find other ways to meet its capital requirements or face possible sale, merger or liquidation. An Oversight Committee aide said that one of the questions the California Republican wants answered is whether the FDIC would have to expend federal taxpayer money in the event the bank liquidates and isn't able to make all its depositors whole. The FDIC declined to comment.  For its part, the Democratic governor's office argues that the agreement, signed under a previous administration, is null because Doral's supporting paperwork did not prove that the bank had overpaid its taxes.  Just last week , debt rater Moody's downgraded the U.S. territory's credit rating further into junk status -- a theme Doral hit in a statement to CNN. ""The government's decision to nullify its agreement with Doral was unexpected,"" the bank said, and ""comes at the very time that the island teeters on financial insolvency. Nevertheless, the government's financial situation should have no bearing on its willingness to fulfill its obligation to honor a legally binding agreement with Doral or any other business."" In the statement, Doral spokeswoman Miriam Warren said while bank officials had not seen Issa's letter, ""We believe that an inquiry from the chairman and his committee represents a significant step in making the government of Puerto Rico accountable for its troubling behavior in this case."" Barbara Morgan, a spokeswoman for the governor's administration, said in a statement that the Treasury Department determined there had been no overpayment and Doral's allegations ""are without merit.""  ""Doral's financial situation was not caused by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and its regulatory issues began many years before the Treasury's determination to nullify the 2012 closing agreement,"" she said, adding that administration officials are working with Issa's staff to provide the information he requested.",https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/11/politics/issa-puerto-rico-tax-deal/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjTsfud2cj6AhUBRjABHYd6Ajo4PBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw0zq8fzzrLwZr94zz-vpkYy,CNN,Liberal
165,20 Things You Didn't Know About Puerto Rico,Carly Ledbetter,6/12/14,"For those of you looking to spend your summer vacation somewhere in the U.S., we have a spot for you: Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is known for beautiful beaches, but it also has some perks you might not know about. So, here are a few reasons a visit to our friends in the Caribbean will totally be worth it. 1. You can leave your passport at home.Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory which means you can ditch the passport, but definitely bring a valid ID. 2. The drinking age is 18. Your college-aged son or daughter would love it if the next family vacation was in PR. 3. The currency is the U.S. Dollar. Which only makes it easier to purchase sunscreen and fun touristy trinkets for the family and friends you left stateside. 4. It's basically 70-80 degrees all year round.Which means it's always the perfect time to visit and explore. 5. There are five Miss Universe winners from Puerto Rico. Tan AND beautiful? Totally unfair. All we can say is, we hope we don't see any of them at the beach. 6. There's a lot of island to explore. Puerto Rico is actually an archipelago, which just means there are more islands to ooh and ahh at during your adventures. 7. And it has a ""lost coast."" While most of Puerto Rico is inhabited by locals and occasionally overrun with tourists, it has a ""wild west coast"" that supposedly has some of the best surfing and diving in the Caribbean. 8. It has the world's largest telescope. Called the Arecibo Observatory, this baby is large, in charge, and ready to predict the next asteroid bound for Earth!9. There are 270 miles of beaches to frolick along. Whether you're headed to Playa Shacks for snorkling, Ballenas Bay to spot some sea turtles or Punta Las Marías in San Juan, there's more than enough sand and surf for everyone 10. There is never any shortage of rum.There's no shortage of distilleries or bottles at the bar, so you'll never have to ask yourself that terrible little question... 11. And speaking of rum...If you're not satisfied just sipping your Don Q, try a chichaíto. Best part? You can get it served as a shot for only $1. 12. But driving could get kind of confusing...You still drive on the right side of the road in PR, but the signs are in Spanish and gas is in liters. 13. Eating well won't break the bank. If you're on a budget, you can get a pretty great meal for as low $3 while high-end restaurants will cost you somwhere around $30 and up. Not too shabby!14. Buried treasure awaits you. Embrace you inner Blackbeard and venture to called Playa Puerto Hermina, where pirate Roberto Cofresi supposedly used to live. 15. It's a ""spelunker's playground."" For those interested in skipping the beach (or maybe taking a tanning break), there are over 200 caves to explore in Rio Camuy Cave Park. 16. The streets are paved with gold. No they aren't, they are actually paved with blue cobblestones that give a charming vibe and plenty of photo ops. 17. It has some of the best coffee in the world. Try as many cups of Yaucono, Alto Grande, El Lareño, Cafe Rico, or Cafe Crema as you possibly can! 18. The beach volleyball is unreal. Volleyball can be a way of life for some in PR, so grab a few friends and give it your best Misty May. One piece of advice? Don't even TRY to kick the locals off a court! 19. ""Diving the wall"" is encouraged. A coral reef cliff better know as La Pared or ""the wall"" lets divers make friends with manatees as they explore some pretty beautiful crystal clear water. 20. There's a 120-foot waterfall with crystal clear water. rosaida93Enjoy some stunning scenery on your drive to Salta de Doña Juana, where waterfall pics are encouraged, but diving is definitely cautioned!

166,What Makes Puerto Rico the Most Special Place in the U.S.A.,"Manuel R. De Juan, Contributor",6/9/14,"I'd like to share my viewpoint on why Puerto Rico truly deserves to have been chosen by USA Today readers as ""The Best U.S. Island""; explained with the top ten reasons of what I think makes Puerto Rico the most special place in the U.S.A. Puerto Rico should be on any bucket list, and any must-repeat list as well.TOP TEN REASONS WHY PUERTO RICO IS THE MOST SPECIAL PLACE IN THE U.S.A.#10: Gastronomy. Puerto Rican cuisine is the most vivid manifestation of our unique culture, which melds Taino indian, African, Spanish and U.S. influences and traditions.#9: Music. Salsa, danza and myriad other forms of music can be heard everywhere, almost at any time. This includes the nocturnal sounds of our tiny singing tree frogs called ""coquís.""#8: History. Since being discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, various cities and towns in Puerto Rico are the longest inhabited areas with people of non-native descent in the U.S.A.#7. Rum. Only the finest rums come from Puerto Rico. The world's largest rum distillery is here. You can visit it and taste free samples.#6. Beaches. Miles of sandy beaches on the main Island, and more in other islands of the Puerto Rico archipelago, including Vieques and Culebra.#5. Nature. Tropical lushness. Underground rivers. El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the U.S. National Forest system. An enviably wonderful year-round climate.#4. Sport. World-class golfing and surfing. Exceptional fishing and scuba diving sites. In Puerto Rico, we are passionate about baseball, basketball, boxing, and increasingly soccer. #3. Quirky. Despite the fact that anyone born in Puerto Rico is a U.S. citizen, no U.S. citizen residing in Puerto Rico has the right to vote for the U.S. President, or to have voting representation in the U.S. Congress.#2. Modernity. First-time visitors to Puerto Rico are universally surprised by the range and quality of infrastructure and facilities in Puerto Rico. We have exceptionally convenient airplane access to the U.S. mainland; and the finest convention center, performing arts centers, symphonic hall, art museums, medical facilities, and general infrastructure south of the U.S. mainland shoreline. Think Miami, yet with far, far more beaches, cultural and nature-related experiences, and ""Latin flavor.""#1. People. The friendliest and most joyful people of the Caribbean. Puerto Ricans have distinguished themselves in all fields of human endeavor. To list a just a very few: artists Rita Moreno, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and Marc Anthony; baseball legend Roberto Clemente; and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Puerto Rico is the Most Special Place in the U.S.A.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-puerto-rico-is-the-mo_b_5461819,HuffPost,Liberal
167,Puerto Rico: The Real Fountain of Youth?,"Richard Bangs, Contributor",5/27/14,"When Christopher Columbus made landfall in Puerto Rico during his second trans-Atlantic voyage, in 1493, a young Spanish nobleman, Ponce de León, some scholars believe, was on board.Rumors of hefty quantities of gold brought Ponce de Leon back, in 1508, where he found an islet with an excellent harbor he named Puerto Rico, or Rich Port. This would become the name of the island, while the town was renamed San Juan. He didn't find gold, but was named first governor of the new territory, and when he heard stories from Taino Indians about a magical fountain whose waters would rejuvenate those who drank from it, he decided he would seek immortality. Can we fault him?Today, locals claim the mineral-rich waters at Coamo, about 10 miles east of Ponce in the south of Puerto Rico, are in fact the Fountain of Youth Ponce de Leon sought, though perhaps he didn't soak long enough, as an arrow squelched his eternity in 1521. But that the belief of the fountain's powers still exist is evident in its current pricing. Anyone over 65 is free, the theory being, I suppose, that if the wayback waters work, the free-soaking seniors will soon be back as paying customers. There is something persistently youthful about Puerto Rico. It's not just that 30 percent of the population is under 25, but rather its potion of nutrient-rich volcanic soil, crisp, clean water, its perpetual June, its healthy outdoor activities, its food, art, and its spirit of dance and celebration that make almost everyone who comes here feel happy and young. Recovering from a surgery a few weeks back, I find myself feeling a bit broken by time's wheel, a little superannuated in a sharp winter, when I speak with my friend John Jessey, who offers up an antidote. ""Go to Puerto Rico. You'll feel ten years younger.""Rather than slouching toward oblivion, or doing a deal with the devil, John's recommendation seems the enchanting choice, so I book a ticket from Los Angeles for a week-long soak, with my family, including 6-year-old Jasper, and our friends Didrik Johnck and Lisa Niver. We leave passports behind, because Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States, a sort of grey-area status where it is not officially a State, but Puerto Ricans enjoy all the benefits of citizenship, save one: Puerto Ricans who live in Puerto Rico cannot vote for the U.S. President in the general elections. And, the currency is the U.S. dollar, which saves all those calculations, and exchange fees that usually end up on post-trip credit card statements. And you can drink the water.I'm a sucker for touching history, and sought to book the Caribe Hilton Hotel, for its storied past, but it was full, so instead we make way to its sister, the Condado Plaza Hilton, just seven miles from the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. I take a room overlooking the aquamarine Atlantic, and with a view of the Caribe Hilton Hotel. It was Hilton's first hotel outside the continental United States and made Hilton the first international hotel company. It was the first in Puerto Rico to offer radios in every room and individually controlled air conditioners, and claims to be the birthplace of the Piña Colada. In 1954, bartender Ramón ""Monchito"" Marrero spent three months creating a medley of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice, which launched a Noah's flood of tropical refreshment, and at least one catchy song. To celebrate, I order one up in the lobby bar. Maybe two. Or four. To be honest, I can't remember, except that they were yummy.The next day, in the first blush of pink light, we translate to the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort, to the east, to play a little golf. Golf here dates to 1958, when Laurance Rockefeller, a pioneer in barefoot elegance, built a resort in Dorado and hired Robert Trent Jones to design its fabled East Course. Now Puerto Rico has 23 courses designed by legendary golf pros, and Rio Mar has two, the Ocean Course, by Tom and George Fazio, and the River course, by Greg Norman, both 18 holes. It's on the 16th hole of the Ocean Course I meet Jesus Rodriguez, younger brother to Chi-Chi, who is the groundskeeper and resident merry prankster. He shows us how to putt a coconut, and mimics the famous victory dance of his legendary brother. And he offers to arrange a meeting with his brother, over at the St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort & Golf Club, with its 18 holes by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., set along two miles of private beach, a former coconut plantation.I meet Chi Chi on the lushly manicured lawn beyond the lobby, and he looks dashing in a fierce blue jacket, yellow tie and signature Panama hat. His eyes are quiet as a pond; his grin electric. He's 78 years old, but has the spark and energy of someone half his age, yet another testament to the youthful stylings of Puerto Rico.Chi Chi says he was born into a dirt poor family, one of six siblings. They struggled to put food on the table. When he was seven, he worked as a water carrier on a sugar plantation. One day he wandered onto a golf course. When he learned the caddies were earning more money than he, he decided to switch careers.Chi Chi would take a branch from a guava tree and turn it into a golf club. Using a metal can as a ""golf ball"" he would practice what he had seen ""real"" golfers do. By the time he was 12 he scored a 67. He went on to trophy scores of tournaments, including 22 wins on Senior PGA Tours, and became the first Puerto Rican inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.After mahi mahi tacos with Chi Chi at Seagrapes it's time to undo time, so we head back to the Wyndham, where we take a jungle walk on the grounds, and end up at the estuary of the Mameyes River, where paddle boards and kayaks await. We scull about, among the mangroves for a sweet hour or so, and then walk the beach back to the pools for a mojito (this island is, after all, the largest producer of rum in the world) before thinking about dinner.The sky lightens slowly the next morning, and time pours like treacle as we linger through breakfast. Afterwards, we travel just a short ways to the earthy embrace of El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the US National Forest System. The air seems to be made of a different and more fragrant substance than at home. Everything is pungent and moist. This is where the wrinkles wash away, with over 200 inches of rain a year. We set off on a short hike through a tangle of trees that look as though they awoke in the middle of the night and didn't have time to fix their hair. We pass orchids, giant tree ferns, oversized snails, gushing waterfalls, all the while cupping ears to the two-note chanting of coquí tree frogs, and the squawks of unseen parrots.We next head over to the small town of Fajardo and the mega resort El Conquistador (a Waldorf Astoria property), which mostly sprawls atop a 300-foot-high cliff overlooking the Atlantic. It takes a tall pile of words to convey this 500-acre retreat. A tram trundles down to a marina and the 2.4-acre Coqui Water Park, a font of wading pools, slides and water rides, a jungle-type rope bridge, and a lazy river where Jasper and I grab a tube and float and splash and cachinnate for an hour. If ever a kid's paradise, this seems it, for children from two to a hundred and two. As the evening tips over into darkness we leave Jasper, exhausted and sound asleep in the Wyndham, and head into the city, which puffs up like a sail with its nightlife. We hit a few bars, boîtes and clubs, where the reggaetón and salsa swirl around us in a fluid ribbon. The outfits on parade are meant to make eyeballs explode, tropical tornados of cadmium and cobalt, magenta and marigold...the full rainbow of humanity struts here.Puerto Rico is a kind of crossroads of the Caribbean. Its forts, castles, walls and batteries were originally designed to protect the island from invaders, but when the residents felt secure, it became a way station for seafarers bringing new ideas, art, lifestyles and food. It was a place to share experiences, and embrace diversity. And tolerance was the mortar that held it together. Today it is an island of hospitality, safety and open-mindedness. And one vivid indicator of this is the vibrant LGBT scene.We meet Mr. Gay World Puerto Rico, Juan Ortiz, visiting from New York, who shares how Puerto Rico has such open arms and opportunities for all lifestyles. We meet a few lesbians who agree, and even a gay couple from New York on the eve of nuptials, which have been elaborately designed by one of the top wedding planners in one of the best hotels.In the bath of morning sunlight, before pointing the needle of curiosity to the west, I step through the heavy wooden door of one the many specialty coffee shops, and order up a cup of arabigo Pomarrosa. What a brew! All other coffees drip with envy. I ask its origin, and am told it is from a small farm in the middle mountains of Puerto Rico, in the shadow of the island's highest peak, Cerro de Punta, some 4,357 feet above sea level. I vow to find this place.But first we set out for the far coast, the surfing, kite-boarding and watersports capital of the island. It's a stunning drive through the folded complexities of the island, through tropical parklands and by wild seascapes, through towns humming with optimism, past the dance of life that is Puerto Rico. Come late afternoon we pull into the Royal Isabela, a sprawling resort and golf course at the edge of a 300'-high bluff overseeing the crashing Atlantic, looking more like a link course at the edge of Ireland than a tropical fairway.Here we meet Charlito Pasarell, co-founder of the resort along with brother Stanley, who bounds over to meets us by the clay tennis courts. Charlito was the No. 1 ranked men's singles tennis player in the United States in 1967, and was last year inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He practically gleams with a ruddy vitality and mental crackle that belies his 70 years. Charlito gives us a grand tour on a golf cart, rolling by native grasses, sod-faced bunkers, and wind-twisted trees. He says he discovered this stretch of rugged coastline while overpassing on a helicopter in 1989, and envisioned creating ""the Pebble Beach of the Caribbean."" He set about buying the land, piece by parcel, until he patched together some 1,800 acres. Every aspect of Royal Isabela's design has evolved out of the land itself, and he has gone to great lengths to protect the existing contours, natural features and native flora and fauna along the way. Conventional rules of golf architecture did not apply. Even the 20 freestanding luxury casitas, terraced into a hillside, blend in. They are around here somewhere, he assures.Charlito takes us to an overlook at the 12th hole, and points out a prominent rock that juts from the steep cliff below. It's the profile of a Taino Indian warrior, he says, though its well-defined angularity is softened by the afternoon light. As Charlito traces the features with his hand, the aspects come into focus, unbroken and ageless, as though forever dipped in the fountain of youth. Below is the hurtling seam where water bashes stone, and to the side a long stretch of native dunes, and beyond the white lined surf where Humpback whales are fleeting by.He also shares that he and his brother own a river plantation just across the road with organic farms that produce food for the restaurant and staff. It also has facilities for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding, with a network of paths and converted rail trails, plus stand-up paddle boarding and other water sports on the Guajataca River, all conspiring to keep guests fit and young.We dine that night with Charlito at an outside table at The Restaurant at La Casa, on a patio that wafts with the fragrance of the nearby higuerillo trees. Over fine wine and something called ""airline"" chicken (not because it comes from United or American, but because the breast comes with a drumette attached and protruding, which could be described as looking similar to the tail of a plane). Charlito seasons the plate with tales of his great grandfather, Dr. Manuel Zeno Gandía, who published the first novel by a Puerto Rican author in 1894, and was an early champion for Puerto Rico independence. So, Charlito's blood mixes literature, politics, sports and recreation, a concoction that seems to be a drink well-served in Puerto Rico.It's dark when we finally bid goodbye...one of the consequences of the locavore and slow food movements is a deep-into-the-night dinner...and we hit the road to our next stop, the town of Guánica on the south side of Puerto Rico. It's midnight when we pull into the Copamarina Beach Resort, and with a welcoming chorus of coquí frogs we make our way down salty paths to our rooms and collapse.A honeyed light gushes in when I open the shutters next morning, and for a second I have to shield my eyes. Just beyond a powdery beach the deep blue Caribbean laps, a graceful swooshing sound mixed with the sounds of children skylarking. Ponce de Leon first landed near here, and it's easy to see why he stayed. This is a place that slows down the thoughts, and perhaps the aging process. It's a popular place for destination weddings (as are most of the resorts in Puerto Rico), and we bump into a handsome couple from Ohio, where it is nine degrees and snowing, who just tied the knot here, and are over the moon about the experience, and the grouper mofongo at the café. Lisa, who has dived all over the world, but never Puerto Rico, decides to head out and plumb The Wall, a cliff of coral some 22-miles-long dropping down to a depth of over 1 500 feet, with a local firm, Aqua Adventure. I decide to go and hike the nearby Guánica Dry Forest, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and State Forest, and considered to be the best example of subtropical dry forest in the Caribbean. How could this island harbor so much diversity? A couple of enormous days ago we were wading through the theatrical vegetation of El Yunque, and now we're in a desert festooned with Spanish dildo cacti, natural Bonsais, and tangles of scrub and vines glowing in the long tapers of sunlight. It's not that dissimilar, though, to how the Sierras split California, with fertile valleys on the western side, and desert in the eastern rain shadow. Here the Cordillera Central is the Sierra Madre.We gather again for dinner, and compare notes over plates of mofongo stuffed with grouper in garlic and lemon sauce. Lisa, the jaded diver, is all sparkle and grins, describing the reefs, the brain coral, the caves, the green moray eel, the angel fish, the porcupine fish, the lobster, the reef sharks, and the sea turtle named Lola, and all else that brushed past her in the 100' dive. ""I've dived in six continents. This was the best dive ever,"" she blurts. We decide to divide for the next day as well....Lisa will check out the Fountain of Youth (not that she needs it...she has more energy than a nuclear power plant), and split the wind at the highest and second-longest zip-line on earth at Toro Verde Nature Adventure; the family and I will visit Puerto Rico's second-largest city, Ponce. Founded in the late 17th century, the city experienced a commercial boom in the 19th century, then declined so quickly no one had time to tear anything down. The center of town is crowded with wedding-cake colonial mansions, strutting with balconies, balustrades, and bas-relief. Then there is the whimsical Arabesque confection, the Parque de Bombas, a bright, red-and-black striped wooden firehouse, amidst the neoclassical and Spanish-style buildings. It is the most attention-grabbing site in Ponce, and maybe all of Puerto Rico, and where, on the Plaza las Delicias, we decide to picnic and gawk.After Ponce we wind into the mountains to the recondite Hacienda Pomarrosa, where the unspeakably good coffee I had in San Juan is produced.Stepping from the car the air is so fresh it makes me dizzy for a moment. We meet up with proprietors Kurt Legner and his son Sebastian in the tiny tasting room, where Kurt gives a rattling good history of coffee, from Ethiopia to Arabia to 18th century Puerto Rico, when its coffee was the favorite of European courts. And then Sebastian takes us on a walk through the farm, showing off the healthy plants and the shiny little beans, and the various steps he takes to harvest, clean, and roast the coffee. All of the coffee is processed in small batches. Once the picked beans arrive at the little processing plant, they are peeled by environmentally friendly machinery. After the coffee is peeled, it rests for about eight hours in a water bath. From there it goes to the hot-air drier (no sun drying here...too much rain). After about 24 hours, the coffee beans are stored in a humidity controlled warehouse for safekeeping. The final stop: back at the tasting room, where a cup of joe for the road fills my head to the brim, like a honeybear, with some sort of transcendence. ""Life is beautiful. Coffee makes it even better,"" outpours Sebastian.We all rendezvous at the Best Western Condado Palm, a value hotel (with the largest bedrooms we've seen yet) just steps from the beach and walking distance to the trendy shops and restaurants of Condado. At the bar Lisa shows up looking younger and more effervescent than ever, as though years had drained away in a few hours, like water from a punctured container. It is all the result, she offers, of combining zip-lining with her soak at Coamo, a thrilling and effective concoction.For the final day we make our way to Old San Juan, the 500-year-old Spanish outpost designed to fend off pirates, buccaneers and privateers. They were all looking to pilfer the gold, silver, gems, spices, and furs from Mexico, Central and South America, stashed here for the final trip to Spain. Stepping through the San Juan Gate today is like stepping into a magic glass. It is hard to preoccupy with the concerns of the world once through this gate, for concerns are always about what will happen in the future, and in Old San Juan the future will never come, and the past will never disappear. This seems a world where everything fits together. I thread through narrow streets cobblestoned with the ballast from early ships. On one side there are thick, outward-sloping walls, dotted with cannon embrasures; and on the other, neat pastel blue, yellow, and pink façades. Street cats curl and uncurl around the doorways. It's hot in here...the sun seems to reach through my skin to my bones... so we stop at Caleta de las Monjas 9 and have a few limbers¸ frozen fruit cups, that are instant refreshment. Jasper is inspired, and standing at an overlook to the sea, he recites a poem he composed about his experiences in Puerto Rico:Birds chirp, lizards runCoconuts roll, fish splashCrabs skitter, frogs hopSometimes, all of them make a bandIt's getting late, and we have to head to the airport, but first I insist we stop at a little shop called Olé, where they sell hand-crafted Panama hats woven from fine-textured paja grass. There are hundreds on display, and I try a score before one seems supreme. Feelings of contentment are woven from fine and unexpected filaments, and there is a joy when I gaze into the mirror. The saleswoman blocks the hat to fit the shape of my head. Then she fastens a customized band around the rim, and snugs the finished product in place. Finally, she steps back, and with a broad grin says, ""It makes you look ten years younger.""",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-the-real-foun_b_5339273,HuffPost,Liberal

170,GAO Confirms Statehood Too Costly for Puerto Rico and the U.S.,"Adrian Brito, Contributor",4/2/14,"Granting statehood to Puerto Rico would set back the island's economy, cost American companies billions of dollars and decrease sources of federal revenues.According to a new report published by the U.S General Accountability Office (GAO), out of the estimated $5.2 billion in new federal spending Puerto Rico would receive, only a range of $2-4 billion would come back in new revenues for the federal government. However, statehood would mean that every day Puerto Ricans would be saddled with $2.3 billion in new federal taxes that they do not pay today.The GAO report addressed the adverse impact of statehood on the Island's finances, stating:... [a]s a result of statehood, changes to Puerto Rico government spending and revenue could ultimately affect the government's efforts to maintain a balanced budged... statehood could [therefore] result in reduced Puerto Rico tax revenue. If Puerto Rico's government wished to maintain pre-statehood tax burdens for individual and corporations, it would need to lower its tax rates, which could reduce tax revenues.Given Puerto Rico's recent financial struggles and the government of the Commonwealth's tough economic reform efforts, cutting almost half of the Island's budget would be disastrous. GAO also notes that Puerto Rico's current triple tax-exempt bonds would no longer be exempt from federal taxes, which would make it much harder for the Island to reduce its fiscal woes. U.S. manufacturers in Puerto Rico, in particular pharmaceutical companies, would also face a higher tax-burden under statehood and the U.S GAO report confirms that many of them would leave. This would put in risk more than 80,000 jobs, plus tens of thousands more government jobs that would be at stake if the local government loses billions in tax revenues under statehood.The U.S GAO report states:According to tax policy experts at the Department of the Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation, changes in federal income tax requirements under statehood would likely motivate some corporations with substantial amounts of income derived from intangible assets to relocate from Puerto Rico to lower tax locations. The extent to which such corporations might relocate from Puerto Rico is unknown... [however] an alternative set of revenue estimates to account for some businesses with activities in Puerto Rico potentially relocating under statehood [ranges] between - $0.1 billion to $3.4 billon.So not only will statehood negatively impact the Puerto Rican economy by imposing a larger-than-life fiscal burden on its people and its government, but it will also encourage capital migration, which will in turn reduce the sources of federal tax revenue from Puerto Rico -- and more importantly leave potentially more than 100,000 Puerto Ricans unemployed. Beyond economics, however, it is important to note that Puerto Ricans have rejected becoming the 51st state on each of the four occasions we have voted on the matter since 1967. On November 2012, 1.9 million Puerto Ricans voted on the island's political status, with only 834,191 (44.4 percent) voting for statehood.After all, it seems that at its current economic and fiscal juncture, neither Puerto Rico nor the U.S government is in position to consider statehood as a viable option for the island's political future. It is high time for the U.S. government to help Puerto Rico with economic development and let us decide our own future in a true process of self-determination that includes all sides -- not only statehood.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gao-confirms-statehood-to_b_5070172,HuffPost,Liberal
223,Why more Puerto Ricans are living in mainland U.S. than in Puerto Rico,Cindy Y. Rodriguez,3/24/14,"If it were up to Surey Miranda, she would have never left her family in Puerto Rico.  Miranda, a college graduate, says she had little choice. ""It was a challenge to find a job in Puerto Rico,"" said Miranda, 24, who graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a political science degree in 2012. ""Unfortunately, finding work in government can be challenging, especially since it's the island's main source of employment."" Miranda did everything she was supposed to do: She got her degree, worked as an intern in various places and even landed a part-time position with the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Now, Miranda is one of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have left the U.S. territory in recent years in search of a better life in the U.S. mainland. Opinion:  Citizenship is a birthright in U.S. territories In 2011 and 2012, about 55,000 residents migrated from the island to the mainland each year, according to the Census Bureau's Community Survey.  The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics is still collecting data for those who left in 2013, but it estimates the numbers are about the same.  While Puerto Ricans have migrated to the United States for several generations, the number of departures from 2000-2010 marks the largest migration wave,  at 300,000, since the 1950s, when  close to a half-million migrated to the mainland  during the entire decade. So many residents have left the island over the years that  there are a million more Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States  (4.9 million as of 2011) than in Puerto Rico (3.7 million). Why such a massive population shift in recent years? Mario Marazzi, executive director of the  Puerto Rican Institute of Statistics , says it's mainly because of the 2006 recession that is still punishing the island's economy.   Puerto Rico's unemployment rate is above 15%, more than double  the 7.3% in the mainland , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Last month,  Standard & Poor's announced it had cut Puerto Rico's credit rating to junk status  as the U.S. commonwealth faces $70 billion in debt, including the debt from its utility companies.  Last week, in an attempt to avoid financial ruin, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla signed a bill authorizing the sale of $3.5 million in tax-free general obligation bonds. Even if the auction is successful, the  bonds are considered pretty risky .  In other words, if you thought Detroit was in trouble, Puerto Rico is much worse mainly for this reason: Unlike Detroit, the island cannot file for bankruptcy court protection.  That option is only for municipalities and Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory. In 2012,  a majority rejected the current status and favored statehood as an alternative , hoping that might help alleviate the territory's economic woes.  But the vote was nonbinding and  never went anywhere in Washington . Puerto Ricans favor statehood for first time For Miranda, getting a job wasn't the only factor in her decision to leave Puerto Rico. The rising cost of utilities, rent, gas and tolls were also something she needed to consider. ""Back home, I was sharing an apartment with six other students and still my expenses were taking up 70% of my salary. It was simply impossible,""  Miranda said.   While the cost of living in New York City is  more than double the national average , the cost of living in Puerto Rico is not the best-case scenario for a recent college graduate. For example,  basic monthly utilities  including electricity, heating and water cost about $246 in Puerto Rico as opposed to New York's $161.  ""The cost of living all depends on where you live in Puerto Rico, because while a middle class does exist, very few fall into that category,"" said Marazzi, ""The middle class has to spend a lot more money for quality of life."" For example, two years ago many Puerto Ricans had to invest in water tanks after serious droughts sapped the water supply.  The cost of purchasing and maintaining a water tank isn't something people in the United States have to worry about, Marazzi added.  Also, the electric supply isn't as reliable in Puerto Rico as it is in the United States, so Puerto Ricans have to pay more to protect their televisions and computers.   ""The power goes off for a microsecond every day in Puerto Rico and electronic items don't take well to that. So, anyone with an electronic item worth having has to invest in a universal power supply, which costs about $100 here,"" Marazzi said.  Puerto Ricans aren't just moving to New York, where many have typically migrated in the past.  They are also moving to Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia -- wherever there are jobs. ""Since the early 20th century, Puerto Ricans have been contributing to create what some scholars are calling 'El Nuevo South,'"" said Edwin Melendez, director of Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York.  ""With an influx of Hispanics, the south is becoming more diverse.""  The latest influx of Puerto Ricans includes people primarily between ages 20 and 40, he said. ""Families and young children are migrating as well -- basically entire households are moving,"" Melendez said. While many Puerto Ricans migrating to the United States are young, educated professionals like Miranda, they also  include people from across the socioeconomic spectrum , according to the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, which examines the  migration phenomenon. Opinion:  Treat U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico fairly ""In Puerto Rico, there's a generalized perspective that there's a 'brain drain' because so many young professionals have left,"" said Melendez,  ""but they aren't the only ones leaving. ""It's also labor workers and families. We didn't find any over-representation of a certain kind of people."" Puerto Rico's education system spends close to  $8,000 annually per student , according to the Department of Education.  And while that's not as high as the United States,  which spends an average of $10,000 per student , it's still a significant loss for Puerto Rico, particularly as it faces a major economic crisis.  Each college-educated Puerto Rican who establishes a career elsewhere is a big loss for the commonwealth, explained Puerto Rican political analyst Jay Fonseca in an interview with CNN en Español. ""Why invest so much time and money for a student in Puerto Rico only to have them leave to the U.S. and contribute to society elsewhere?"" Fonseca said. There's even an active recruiting process by U.S.-based organizations, like police departments, nurse associations and hospitals, who come to Puerto Rico to search for future employees, Marazzi said.  ""They not only recruit the best bilingual candidates but they help diversify the workforce in the United States, of course to their benefit,"" said Marazzi. It's a seamless process considering all Puerto Ricans, whether born on the island territory or on the mainland, are American citizens. Marazzi added that it's not just the money that's attracting residents to leave the island.  ""It's also an opportunity to work in a world class field that cares about your profession. But it is unfortunate that Puerto Rico cannot do much for the talent it produces,"" he said.  Miranda said her decision to leave the island wasn't just to alleviate her current situation: She knew she would have more long-term career opportunities in New York than if she stayed in Puerto Rico. According to Melendez, the likelihood that Miranda will return to Puerto Rico is slim, because so many Puerto Ricans who migrate to the mainland settle down and stay. Yet Miranda said she hasn't given up on her goal to improve things back home.  ""Seeing the way New York City operates makes you notice what Puerto Rico lacks and makes me want to go back and do things a different way,"" Miranda said.   ""But it does not depend on us, it depends whether Puerto Rico's government will allow us to contribute in the reconstruction of our country.""",https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/22/us/puerto-rico-migration-economy/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi844e27sj6AhXlRDABHaErAIw4mAIQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw3qZuG4FVjYoYWAYJs8-D0f,CNN,Liberal
171,Puerto Rico Statehood Resolution Introduced In Senate,Roque Planas,2/12/14,"Puerto Rico just took a small step in the direction of becoming the 51st U.S. state.U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) submitted legislation Wednesday that would mandate a referendum asking Puerto Rican residents if the island should become a U.S. state in an up-or-down vote. The Senate resolution, called the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act, is an identical companion version to legislation already filed in the House by the island’s non-voting representative, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi. “In 2012, 54 percent of Puerto Ricans rejected their current relationship with the United States,” Heinrich said in a press release. “We have a responsibility to act on that referendum, and this step is critical in that effort. My home state of New Mexico spent 66 years as a territory before gaining statehood in 1912 -- the longest of any state. Puerto Rico has spent nearly 116 years as an American territory. That’s long enough.” Pierluisi, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, has been pushing hard for statehood since a non-binding plebiscite in 2012 showed that most Puerto Ricans were dissatisfied with their position as a U.S. commonwealth. The two-part referendum went on to ask whether voters wanted to become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a freely associated state -- a type of voluntarily limited sovereignty. Remaining a commonwealth was not an option. Statehood won the largest number of votes, but because commonwealth supporters cast blank ballots on the second question in protest, statehood failed to win a majority of the votes cast. While some statehood supporters tried to argue that the blank ballots should be discarded from the final tally, their case failed to convince Congress or the White House that the referendum amounted to a statehood mandate. Whether or not the statehood resolution passes, Puerto Rico’s status will remain a major issue for the near future. The Obama administration included $2.5 million in the Omnibus Spending Bill to conduct a plebiscite aimed at resolving the status conflict.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-statehood-resolution_n_4777128,HuffPost,Liberal
172,Marijuana Decriminalization In Puerto Rico Will Have To Wait,Roque Planas,11/18/13,"Puerto Rico won’t be decriminalizing weed this year.The island’s lower house let the legislative session expire without taking up a bill passed by the Puerto Rican Senate that would have decriminalized the possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Día reports. The bill’s author has vowed to reintroduce the measure next year. The proposal is one of two major bills that questioned the issue of marijuana prohibition during this year’s legislative session. The other bill would have legalized marijuana for medical use. But efforts to ease marijuana regulation hit a speed bump this month when a survey by Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Día found overwhelming opposition to them. A whopping 70 percent of respondents opposed decriminalization and 60 percent opposed legalizing medical marijuana. The lack of public support reflected in the poll prompted the author of the medical marijuana bill, Rep. José Báez, to hold off on his initiative for now. The author of the decriminalization bill, Sen. Miguel Pereira of the ruling Popular Democratic Party, says the bill will go to committee in the lower house in January, when the new legislative session begins. Marijuana would remain illegal in Puerto Rico under Pereira’s bill, but possession of less than one ounce would no longer carry jail time. Instead, offenders would pay fines of between $100 and $500. Under Puerto Rico’s current law, marijuana possession carries penalties of up to three years in jail and up to $5,000 in fines.

173,Puerto Rico's Population Drops Due To Shaky Economy,Reuters,9/10/13,"* Caribbean island's population dropped 1.5 percent in a year* Exodus stings housing, schools and businesses* Jobs scarcity, crime motivate many moves to mainlandBy Michael ConnorSept 10 (Reuters) - For generations, Puerto Ricans have been migrating to the mainland United States in search of a better life. But the Caribbean island's long recession has turned a steady flow into a torrent, stripping the territory of its young and educated population and pushing its economy into a deeper rut.The effects are evident in the capital city of San Juan, where vacant offices dot its Golden Mile banking strip and blocks of empty condominiums have become eyesores marring its tropical beach front.As U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans are free to move to the mainland without legal restrictions, an option that tens of thousands of people - many of them young and well-educated - are now choosing.In 2011 alone, the island lost a net 54,000 people, or nearly 1.5 percent of its population, as the economy weathered a sixth year of a recession that only ended in 2012.""This is a worrisome picture for Puerto Rico,"" said Deepak Lamba-Nieves, research director at San Juan's Center for the New Economy think tank, who added that Puerto Rico's economy has shrunk by nearly 14 percent since 2006, and its labor force participation is among the lowest in the world.Some economists estimate the outward flow has reduced the island's gross domestic product, now at $101 billion a year, by some $3 billion in the last decade, in part because of an increase in skilled Puerto Ricans leaving the island.Its unemployment rate is worse than any U.S. state at 13.5 percent, U.S. Department of Labor data shows, and it's been stuck at 10 percent or higher for at least a decade.""And you have all these other problems like crime,"" Lamba-Nieves said, ""you are bound to see people looking for opportunities elsewhere."" GRAYING OF SOCIETYMaria Luisa Monserrate can't put her finger on a single reason for her decision to leave the island for a new life on the mainland with her teenage son and toddler daughter.""Long term, I know the job market is pretty hard,"" said the 35-year-old single mother, who is preparing to leave her job as an organizational development trainer and join a brother and sister settled in Minneapolis.""The public safety issue is a big factor. I always have to look over my shoulder,"" she said. ""There are better educational opportunities than I can afford here.""The island's murder rate runs six times that of the mainland, according to Michigan State University. Much of the violence is tied to illegal drug-trafficking, and Police Superintendent Hector Pesquera has said that the level of violence in Puerto Rico would spark an emergency declaration if it occurred elsewhere in the United States.Statistics suggest young professionals are leaving the island in droves. The number of doctors and teachers getting on planes quadrupled in 2011, according a study entitled ""Profile of the Migrant"" by Puerto Rico's Institute of Statistics. At the same time, the median age of returnees is steadily rising.""The graying of society occurs at an alarming rate in Puerto Rico,"" said Vincente Feliciano, an economist at Advantage Business Consulting. ""The migration is up and down the socioeconomic scales, from neurosurgeons to house maids. The constant is that the migrants tend to be younger.""Puerto Rico's 1,500 public schools expect 415,000 to 420,000 children to enroll this school year, down from 441,000 students last year and more than 500,000 a decade ago, in part because birth rates are declining.Puerto Rico's brain drain and its shrinking population have become fodder for headlines on the island.Recent news that the family of a child actor featured in an economic development ad had moved to Florida brought an ironic twist to the worrisome trend.The family later said the move is not permanent because the father, an engineer, has a temporary employment contract in Florida and keeps his home on the island. SHRINKING CONSUMPTIONThe migratory wave shows few signs of letting up, with the U.S. Census Bureau projecting the population will drop to 2.3 million in 2050, compared with 3.7 million at present.The 4.9 million Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States as of 2011 outnumbered those on the island by more than 1 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.The effects are showing up in a wide range of statistics, including construction, housing, school enrollments and retail sales, according to economists and government data.Government officials last month reported that sales-and-use taxes, generated largely by consumers, shrank to $553 million in fiscal 2013, down from $797 million five years earlier.Sales of gasoline, electricity and cement dropped in July from a year earlier, according to government data released Aug. 30. Non-farm payroll employment that month dropped 3.7 percent to 889,400 from a year earlier, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said.To be sure, funds sent home by more emigrants might help support the Puerto Rico's wobbly economy. But data on remittances by Puerto Ricans is not made available by the World Bank, which provides numbers for other countries. Local studies, however, have shown Puerto Ricans tend to send relatively low remittances back home, compared with emigrants from other countries in the region.Regardless, depopulation has made it more difficult for the territory to reverse its economic decline and pay off debts of about $70 billion, which are far higher on a per capita basis than any mainland state government.It is a situation that echoes the economic troubles that caused the financial crises of Detroit and Stockton, California, though, unlike those jurisdictions, Puerto Rico is ineligible for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy protection because any debt overhaul would have to be treated as a foreign obligation, analysts say.Still, the outflow has stirred fears in the U.S. municipal bond market that a smaller, more impoverished population will have to repay Puerto Rico's massive debt. Reflecting the perceived risk, the island pays interest rates far higher than any state government. Yields of some Puerto Rico bonds spiked above 10 percent on Monday.""We are seeing occur what occurred in Detroit. But it is not as severe a case as Detroit,"" said Dan Heckman, fixed income strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

174,Puerto Rico's Status Debate Continues As Island Marks 61 Years As A Commonwealth (GRAPHS) (VIDEO),VOXXI,7/25/13,"On July 25, 1952, in front of a crowd waving American and Puerto Rican flags, Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Muñoz Marin officially raised the Puerto Rican flag for the first time. That day, the constitution — and with it, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico — was put in place. But will this now-highly-debated status endure the test of time?The commonwealth, officially known in Spanish as the Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, still stands — proudly to some, shamefully to others.Muñoz Marin was the first governor elected by Puerto Ricans, and he is credited with the creation of this arrangement which has made Puerto Rico part of the United States of America — though not a state.The establishment of the Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto RicoShortly after he received 61 percent of votes and took office, Muñoz Marin tackled the status dilemma. The governor preferred a solution between statehood and independence that would give Puerto Rico sovereignty.In Washington, D.C., the island’s representative in Congress — Resident Commissioner Antonio Fernos Isern — introduced a bill in March 1950 to the House of Representatives, asking the U.S. for authorization for Puerto Ricans to redact their constitution. Four months later, that bill became U.S. Public Law 81-600, which the people of Puerto Rico voted to approve in a referendum in June 1951.The constitution was redacted, approved by a constitutional assembly one year later, in February 1952. Then Puerto Ricans voted to approve that constitution in March 1952. It went to Congress for approval, and finally, President Harry S. Truman ratified it on July 3. It went into effect three weeks“I will raise [the flag] upon the foundation of the free state in voluntary association of citizenship and affection with the United States of America,” Muñoz Marin said on July 25, 1952. “The people will see in it the symbol of its spirit before its own destiny.”To the sound of the national anthem — “La Borinqueña” — the flag was raised to stand alongside the U.S.’ flag. But the creation of the Estado Libre Asociado hardly solved the debate surrounding the island’s political status.This Thursday, the Island of Enchantment’s government will celebrate this milestone amid questions of whether the island is closer than ever to become the 51st state to join the union, leaving behind the Estado Libre Asociado.The hunger for statehoodThe debate about the political status of Puerto Rico started decades before the commonwealth came to be. There is much unhappiness with the relationship between the island and the U.S. Many have highlighted the fact that Puerto Ricans can be sent to war at the president’s disposal, but they can’t vote in presidential elections. In addition, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress can introduce legislation, but he can’t vote on anything.These, and other factors, have led the statehood movement to grow over the years.Today, the three main political parties on the island — instead of being divided in terms of liberals and conservatives — are divided by three different visions for Puerto Rico.The Popular Democratic Party, commonly referred to as PPD by Puerto Ricans due to its acronym in Spanish, is the party in power, with current Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla at the helm. Founded by Muñoz Marin 75 years ago, it defends the commonwealth. When it comes to U.S. politics, it has aligned with the Democratic Party.The New Progressive Party, commonly known as PNP, is the party for statehood. Their highest-ranking official is Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat who has been diligently working on pushing the congressional debate on statehood for Puerto Rico. In terms of U.S. politics, the PNP has a mix of Republican and Democrat members. The most recent high-profile Republican to lead the party was former Gov. Luis Fortuño, ousted by Garcia Padilla.The Puerto Rican Independence Party — or PIP — has, for decades, demanded independence. They call for the liberation of Puerto Rico, but they have never gotten close to beating the PPD or PNP in elections.As time goes by, the debate between these parties has intensified. The last administration to lead the country — Fortuño’s — ran on a platform to resolve the status question once and for all. Last year, it arranged a plebiscite to ask the people what status they would prefer. However, this wasn’t the first plebiscite to propose this question, and it will most likely not be the last.A history of plebiscitesSince 1952, four plebiscites have taken place to ask the people of Puerto Rico their opinion on the island’s political status — in 1967, 1993, 1998 and 2012.Graphs By VOXXIThe 1967 plebiscite stands alone in that it has been the only plebiscite approved by Congress. It had three straightforward options: Stay with the commonwealth, become a state or choose independence. This has also been the only plebiscite to take place under a PPD administration.Graphs By VOXXIThe 1993 plebiscite was the first of two that took place under Gov. Pedro Rossello’s (PNP) administration. Rossello lost no time in conducting this plebiscite — he had taken office 10 months before Puerto Ricans were consulted. The Estado Libre Asociado prevailed again.Graphs By VOXXIThe plebiscite that took place in 1998 — Rossello’s second — was the most controversial one yet.The reason for controversy was that the definitions provided for the option to keep the commonwealth and the option for sovereignty. The PPD was not pleased with the way the PNP had laid out the options, and took offense at the way the Estado Libre Asociado was described.There were five columns (options):The first column described the commonwealth as a “limited government” that Congress could treat in a way different from the states.The second column offered a sovereign state associated with the United States. Puerto Ricans would no longer be born U.S. citizens, though the ones that already held American citizenship could pass that citizenship down to their descendants. The U.S. would renounce all powers in relation to Puerto Rico. A new treaty would be drafted to agree upon Puerto Rico’s role in the international stage, among other things.The third column asked the U.S. to welcome Puerto Rico into the union as a state. The governor passionately campaigned for this option.The fourth column offered independence.The fifth and final column was the “none of the above” option. It was added after the PPD argued the Estado Libre Asociado was not properly represented, and there were no options they could support. The party campaigned for this option — La Quinta Columna — and prevailed.The most recent plebiscite took place last November, on election day.Fortuño and the resident commissioner, Pedro Pierluisi, ran in 2008 on the promise that they would get statehood for the island. Three years after they took office, in time for their re-election campaign, plans for the new plebiscite were drafted. Of course, their PPD opponents disagreed with the layout.This plebiscite asked two questions:Graphs By VOXXIThose supporters of the commonwealth were outraged that the three options from the second question didn’t include the option to vote for the Estado Libre Asociado.So while Fortuño and Pierluisi campaigned for re-election and statehood, their main opponents at the PPD campaigned for people to leave the second question blank, a strategy that the resident commissioner told VOXXI was “cynical and unwise.” In the end, almost half a million voters left the second question blank. Of the three options, statehood got the most votes.The first question, asking whether Puerto Ricans are happy with the current status, received a resounding, “No,” thanks to statehooders, those who support sovereignty, independence supporters and others who are tired of the commonwealth.The futurePierluisi had two victories on election night: the victory of statehood and his re-election. The challenge was dealing with Garcia Padilla, who — of course — opposes statehood and said nothing would be done to take the plebiscite results to Congress. Pierluisi went ahead and appealed to Congress, regardless.Backed by a provision in the latest Obama budget, the resident commissioner saw an opening. The president’s budget allows for a U.S.-sanctioned plebiscite to ask people to vote on status once again. Pierluisi has introduced legislation into the House to coordinate for a plebiscite which — this time around — would be a simple matter of voting “yes” or “no” to statehood.Although Pierluisi’s bill currently has 99 cosponsors — one of them Puerto Rican Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.) — the other two Puerto Ricans serving in Congress have raised their voices to ask their colleagues to reject the resident commissioner’s bill.Reps. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) wrote a letter to House members this week, saying that more than 55 percent of voters rejected statehood — if the ballots left blank in protest, votes for independence and votes for a free sovereign state were added.“Given the intentionally flawed nature of last year’s referendum, a true process of self-determination should take place in which all the available options are presented to the voters in Puerto Rico,” Gutierrez and Velazquez wrote.It remains to be seen what will happen to Pierluisi’s bill, since it remains in committee and there has yet to be a hearing on it.However, with all these developments, this 25th of July, the 61-year-old Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico could be closer than ever to a change.Originally published on VOXXI as The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico at 61: Closer to statehood?",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-status-debate_n_3651755,HuffPost,Liberal
224,Agreement announced to reform Puerto Rico's police force,Carol Cratty,7/17/13,"The Justice Department and Puerto Rico signed a major civil rights agreement Wednesday to reform the commonwealth's very troubled police force. The pact faces final approval by a federal judge, who will oversee its enforcement. An earlier Justice Department investigation found numerous problems in the Puerto Rico Police Department, the nation's second-largest, including: -- Excessive use of force to suppress free speech. -- Unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests. -- A failure to investigate sexual assault and domestic violence allegations. ""Although I recognize that complete and lasting reform will not take hold overnight, I'm confident that this agreement lays out a clear path for responding to concerns, correcting troubling practices, safeguarding the rights of Puerto Rican citizens, restoring public trust, and ensuring public safety,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in remarks prepared for a news conference. According to the Justice Department, the agreement with Puerto Rico is among the most extensive agreements involving the police misconduct provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the agreement on an issue it highlighted more than a year ago. ""At long last, the government of Puerto Rico will work together with the Justice Department to end the rampant police abuse that has plagued the island for so many years,""  Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement. ""We trust that this historic settlement means that Puerto Ricans will no longer have to live in fear of their own police force. A court-enforceable agreement like this ensures that the PRPD will be held accountable if it fails to overhaul its policies and practices."" An ACLU report in June 2012  disclosed evidence of widespread abuses and violations of civil rights by the 17,000-strong police department, saying the force ""has run amok for years."" The abuse was ""pervasive and systemic, island-wide and ongoing,"" the report said. The Justice Department announced in December that it reached a preliminary agreement with Puerto Rico. It delayed implementation to allow then-incoming Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla the time to review it and suggest possible changes.

175,"Puerto Rico Statehood Fight Headed To United Nations, If White House Doesn't Act: Pierluisi (VIDEO)",Roque Planas,6/18/13,"Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress said Monday he’d take his fight forstatehood to the United Nations if the Barack Obama administration refuses to act.Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi made the comments during a testimony before the U.N. Special Committee on Decolonization, which passed a resolution presented by Cuba affirming the island’s right to self-determination and calling on the U.S. government to free the independence fighters Oscar López Rivera and Norberto González Claudio. “Let me be clear, Mr. Chairman,” Pierluisi said. “In the absence of concrete and timely action from the U.S. government, I will not hesitate to raise this case before the United Nations or any other appropriate international forum.” (Watch Pedro Pierluisi's speech before the U.N. Commitee on Decolonization in the video below). The statement marks the latest development in a campaign by Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi and the pro-statehood New Progressive Party to change the island’s status after a non-binding referendum held in November found that 54 percent of Puerto Rican voters oppose the island’s current relationship with the United States. “The current status has lost its democratic legitimacy,” Pierluisi said. “The only path forward is statehood or nationhood.”Puerto Rico held a two-part referendum on Nov. 6 that breathed new life into the statehood movement, but has yet to make an impact on U.S. policy. The question asked whether voters were satisfied with their current relationship with the United States. Dissatisfaction ruled the day. But the second question did more to muddle the debate than establish a mandate. It asked whether voters favored becoming a U.S. state, an independent country or becoming a freely associated sovereign state. Statehood won a clear majority of the votes cast, with 61 percent. But, urged by Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, more than 480,000 voters cast blank ballots because remaining a commonwealth was not included, dropping the share of statehood votes to 46 percent of the total. The U.N. Committee on Decolonization has voted 12 times in recent years to support Puerto Rican self-determination, but the vote hasn’t made it before the General Assembly, according to Terra.

176,Oscar Lopez Rivera's 32-Year Imprisonment Protested In Puerto Rico,,5/29/13,"Several prominent Puerto Ricans locked themselves in a jail cell Wednesday toprotest the 32-year imprisonment of independence fighter Oscar López Rivera, El Nuevo Día reports.Among those who have spent 15 minutes locked up symbolically is Carlos Delgado, an ex-baseball player who wrote “I can only imagine how much mental strength and courage you have” on the jail cell’s wall. Former Puerto Rican Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vilá also spent 15 minutes in the cell and wrote: “Thank you for not giving up.”The protesters hope to bring President Barack Obama's attention to the issue.López Rivera, 70, was charged with “seditious conspiracy” in 1981 and sentenced to 55 years in jail. Former President Bill Clinton offered 12 Puerto Rican political prisoners clemency in 1999, including López Rivera, but he declined the offer, according to ProLibertad Web.López Rivera headed the Chicago wing of the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN, in Spanish), a Puerto Rican separatist group known in the 1970s and 1980s for various bombings across the United States.López Rivera is now the Puerto Rican political prisoner who has been imprisoned for the longest time in the history of the nation's independence movement. He is currently serving the remainder of his sentence in a U.S. federal prison in Indiana. Puerto Rican governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla joined the campaign to pardon López Rivera giving a written statement saying:“The release of Puerto Rican, Oscar López Rivera, after 32 years in prison, is an issue that is directly related to the principles of social justice, humanity and compassion. Because of this I have asked the President of the United States of America, honorable Barack Obama, to execute his constitutional power and grant [López Rivera] a presidential pardon so he can be freed and reintegrated into our society. Justice demands his release.”The campaign, which started at midnight on Wednesday, prompted strong reactions on Twitter with many voicing contrasting opinions over whether López Rivera should receive a pardon.",[],HuffPost,Liberal

It is not the first time Ricky Martin gets involved in Puerto Rico’s social and political movements. The new “The Voice Australia” judge, has been very vocal in the past supporting the cancellation of polemic TV show “SuperXclusivo” and La Comay, as well as asking for a new and “serious statehood plebiscite.” He has also turned to social media repeatedly to express his concern regarding Puerto Rico’s decision to deny gay couples the right to adopt children. “How sad,"" the star wrote in Twitter back on February.

178,"Puerto Rico Statehood Legislation Heading To Congress, PNP Says",Roque Planas,4/29/13,"The leadership of Puerto Rico’s New Progressive Party voted unanimously on Monday to submit legislation to the U.S. Congress aimed at making the island the 51st state, local press report.It remained unclear from reports, however, whether the legislation would require another plebiscite. The party's resolution puts Puerto Rican Resident Comissioner Pedro Pierluisi and ex-Governor Carlos Romero Barceló in charge of outlining a statehood legislation strategy, according to Primera Hora. A press statement posted to Pierluisi’s Facebook page said the bill would “establish the process to achieve the admission of Puerto Rico as a state in the American Union.” There are those in the pro-statehood PNP who say they’ve had enough of plebiscites and would like to simply push the question to a vote in Congress. Puerto Rico has remained a U.S. commonwealth despite holding four referendums on the island’s status since 1967. But the Obama administration did not appear convinced that the last plebiscite amounted to a clear mandate for statehood. Puerto Rico held a two-part, non-binding referendum on Nov. 6 that energized the island’s statehood movement, but didn’t show majority support for the idea. The first question asked whether voters were satisfied with their current relationship with the United States. Some 52.4 percent said they were dissatisfied. The second question asked whether voters wanted the island to become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a freely associated sovereign state -- a type of independence in close alliance with the United States. Remaining a commonwealth wasn’t an option on the second question. Statehood won the largest share of votes, but more than 480,000 voters cast blank ballots on the second question, leaving statehood with just 44.9 percent of the total. An item in the White House budget submitted to Congress this month marks $2.5 million for another plebiscite on Puerto Rico’s status.

179,Puerto Rico Status Vote Proposed By White House,Roque Planas,4/10/13,"Puerto Rico may be getting another status vote.The White House budget submitted to Congress Wednesday includes a $2.5 million appropriation for Puerto Rico to hold another plebiscite on its relationship to the United States. Calling for another vote indicates the Obama administration has rejected the argument that Puerto Ricans voted to become the 51st state in a two-part referendum held in November. But the proposal also recognizes that a majority of Puerto Ricans aren’t happy with their current commonwealth status. Puerto Rico’s lone, non-voting Congressman, Representative Pedro Pierluisi, a statehood supporter, applauded the proposal:Today is an historic day for all of us who have been fighting for equality and justice for Puerto Rico. The White House has recognized that, on November 6, 2012, a majority of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico withdrew their consent to the current territory status, which deprives them of the most fundamental democratic rights.A two-part referendum on Puerto Rico’s status in November left many wondering whether the island had voted to become a U.S. state. The first question asked whether voters wanted to keep the island’s current U.S. commonwealth status. A majority of voters -- 52 percent -- said they were dissatisfied with the current relationship. Then the referendum asked if voters wanted to become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a freely associated state -- a type of independence in close alliance with the United States. About 61 percent of those who answered the second question chose statehood. But that 61 percent wasn’t a majority. More than 470,000 voters intentionally left the second question blank, leaving statehood with only about 45 percent of the total votes cast. The White House had previously sent contradictory messages about the referendum. Luis Miranda, the White House’s Hispanic Affairs spokesman told Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Día in December that the referendum amounted to a mandate for statehood, just hours after White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the vote result was unclear. Here’s the full statement on the proposed Puerto Rico status vote from the White House budget, via Pierluisi:$2,500,000 for objective, nonpartisan voter education about, and a plebiscite on, options that would resolve Puerto Rico's future political status, which shall be provided to the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico: Provided, That funds provided for the plebiscite under the previous proviso shall not be obligated until 45 days after the Attorney General notifies the Committees on Appropriations that he approves of an expenditure plan from the Commission for voter education and plebiscite administration, including approval of the plebiscite ballot; Provided further, That the notification shall include a finding that the voter education materials, plebiscite ballot, and related materials are not incompatible with the Constitution and laws and policies of the United States.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-status-vote_n_3056579,HuffPost,Liberal

She is not my daughter."" Yet, despite Velez's 25-year-long relationship,Puerto Rican courts refuse to allow her partner to legally adopt their child. Her partner is a woman.Velez is a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, where the institution's health insurance covers the partners of LGBTQ employees and where she can safely display pictures of her nontraditional family on her desk. And, beyond of the university's progressive campus, the island has anti-discrimination laws that provide her and other gay Puerto Ricans recourse against harassment and hate crimes. Velez is at the heart of the island's cultural clash over gay rights. As the territory's government increasingly—however slowly—institutes measures to help the gay community, the general population hasn't quite caught up. In January, former conservative governor Pedro Rosello voiced support of same sex marriage. Less than a month later in February, religious groups organized a march against gay rights attended by 200,000 ""pro-family"" demonstrators.Alicia Menendez led a HuffPost Live conversation on Puerto Rico’s cultural clash featuring Dr. Velez, along with Pedro Julio Serrano, a prominent Puerto Rican activist, Angel Toledo-López, a professor at the Sistema Universitario Ana G.

""There is of course a very active religious population in Puerto Rico and their first step is going to be to let [legislators] know that they're going to be very active in their churches, letting the members of their churches know that they should vote against these senators or representatives."" But some legislators in favor of equality for gay Puerto Ricans say they are willing to accept any political blowback that might come their way, “If there is any political consequence, it will be my cross to bear,” said Senator Nieves, who submitted a bill in January making it a crime to discriminate against people based on their gender or sexual orientation. “I’m very confident because I was the candidate for the senate in San Juan, our nation's capital, and we had very big support from the LGBT community.”“We cannot live in fear,” says Pedro Julio Serrano, a spokesperson for the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force. “As a person who twice has had to deal with attempts against [my] life, I'm going back to Puerto Rico next year to live in my country,” says Serrano who travels back and forth between San Juan and New York City. “We need to rescue our Puerto Rico and say that this is our country too.” ",[],HuffPost,Liberal
182,Zombie Island: Puerto Rico Drug Addiction Turning Resident Users Into Zombies (VIDEO),,1/4/13,"On an island where theeconomy is manipulated by drugs, andhundreds of thousands of residents have consumed or are currently consuming addictive substances, it might not come as a surprise that Puerto Rico has been described as“the new front door of the war on drugs”, or “the backdoor to America.”The island's strategic localization, its multiple rich ports, in addition to its commonwealth political status and relationship to the United States, serve drug cartels from South America and the Caribbean, as the perfect trampoline to the mainland. But the drug doesn’t just travel out of the island; it also stays inside affecting residents every year. Thousands of people wake up everyday to the reality of having to maintain an addiction, to some of the most dangerous substances. One of the island’s most common drugs, mainly for being cheaper than others and producing a strong high effect, is Xylazine, better known as horse tranquilizer. This new medication, introduced in the early 2000 is primarily produced to be used by veterinarians as an anaesthetic for dental work or castration in horses.In humans, the powerful substance causes the mind to fade in and out of conscience and the body to bend to the ground even while standing on its feet. The effects last for a little less than six hours, leaving the addict with the need to roam the streets in a search for the next fix, many resorting to theft and panhandling in and effort to stay awake, and alive. On a recent episode of National Geographic Channel's ""Drugs Inc."" these Xylazine drug addicts were labeled as sleep walking zombies, living on a zombie island.

183,Boycott Against 'La Comay': Puerto Rico's Social Media Movement Scores Important Victory,Voxxi,12/7/12,"Puerto Rico’s social media population scored a big win this week. Following the shocking gruesomemurder of Jose Enrique Gomez, Puerto Ricans began mobilizing to create awareness against the rampant violence. By Wednesday, Puerto Ricans across Facebook and Twitter began posting signs saying “I am Jose Enrique” in signs of solidarity. EvenRicky Martin joined the movement and posted his own version of the line. However, it was not until Puerto Rico’spuppeteer La Comay joined the discussion on Tuesday that social media exploded.On Tuesday, La Comay conveyed rumors, as she always does, that the victim’s death was related to a sexually promiscuous lifestyle based on allegations that Jose Enrique’s death preceded a visit to an area in the city of Caguas known for its male and female prostitution. The allegations stem from the alleged confession of one of the perpetrators, who claim that the victim stopped to pick up two female prostitutes, and following a dispute over monies owed, the two accused men boarded the car. La Comay, using her trademark opening line “supuesta y alegadamente” (allegedly and supposedly) tied the victim’s death (burned alive and beaten to death) to his rumored ”sexually deviant” lifestyle. In summation, it wasn’t the criminal’s fault for killing him, it was his own for being there in the first place.While this is not the first time that the famed Puppeteer has engaged in homophobic or hateful comments, it may prove to be the one that hurts his bottom line the most. On Tuesday night, a Facebook group was formed called “Boicot La Comay” (Boycott La Comay). That night, the numbers of followers quickly reached 500 followers. By the next day, the number had reached over 30,000, with 40,000 by Thursday morning. Supporters petitioned for the companies that advertise on the show to pull their ads and support. Throughout Wednesday, company after company started announcing that they would pull other ads from the gossip show. Dish Network, Triple-S Insurance, Banco Popular ATH, Lanco Puerto Rico, Borden Dairy, Palo Viejo Rum and Claro all announced that they would pull their advertising and it would stand in solidarity with the victim, his family and supporters. On Thursday, supporters placed their aim on Walmart, who advertises on the show, to pull its ads.Some have dismissed “Facebook activism” as something that merely stays on a status feed and timeline. Although this tale is far from finished, moving onward, Puerto Ricans have been able to effectively take out big time advertisers of this popular, yet corrosive, gossip show. The shows network, WAPA, issued a statement stating that while it did not identify some of the comments in the show, it stood by the independence of its program, adding that the response for a boycott is an emotional one.Puerto Ricans have not accepted the TV channel’s excusePuerto Ricans have not accepted this excuse and have continued the mobilization to stand up to the show by targeting it’s advertisers. The targeted companies have surprised many on the Island, who previously considered La Comay to be untouchable. This victory, cannot be understated. The gossip show is the highest rating show in the entire island, despite the daily criticisms it may generate. Politicians, such as Rafael Bernabe (P.R. Workers Party) refused to go on the show, even though it would have been politically favorable for publicity to do so.Despite previous attempts at protesting La Comay, this time is different. The horrendous crime that Puerto Ricans have witnessed during this weekend has superseded the “acceptable” levels of barbarism of which we have lived for the past three years. While Jose Enrique is not the first victim of this crime wave, La Comay’s portrayal of his death has pushed public opposition to its boiling pint. The victim was taken to a field (after he was allegedly forced to withdraw $500 from an ATM machine), doused with gasoline and beaten to death with sticks. Puerto Ricans have not only rejected this vile crime, but they have further rejected the “blame the victim” rhetoric touted by La Comay.Make no mistake, the gossip show is a cancer to Puerto Rican society. While some may praise its success and breaking news, all it propagates is a culture of gossip, backstabbing and reputation destruction. For too long, the show’s homophobic slant has gone effectively unchallenged. With the boycott group supporters climbing exponentially, and advertisers pulling their ads with equal speed, La Comay may finally feel the fire under its dress.Originally published by Voxxi as La Comay: Puerto Rico’s social media scores an important victory ",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/boycott-la-comay-puerto-rico_n_2257952,HuffPost,Liberal

The name has grabbed attention over the last couple of days, including from Latino celebrities likesinger and actor Ricky Martin, and salsa singer Victor Manuelle.The movement, #TodosSomosJoséEnrique (We Are All José Enrique), comes as an initiative from people in Puerto Rico to address the violent crime wave facing the island.According to local newspaper El Vocero, the most recent victim was publicist José Enrique Gómez, 32, who was burned alive, beaten to death and left to be consumed by the flames in the town of Cayey last Friday. The circumstances surrounding the case aren't entirely clear. The perpetrators -- two males and two females -- wanted to rob him, according to legal documents reported by El Vocero. Another Puerto Rican daily, El Nuevo Día, reported the suspects are in custody and allege that Gómez picked up the women in his car looking for sex services. The campaign, which gained strength on social platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, shows people carrying a sign with Gómez’ name on it. They aim to raise consciousness inside and outside of Puerto Rico and to draw attention to the island's growing problem with violence.Other recent murders, like last month's shooting of boxer Hector 'Macho' Camacho and his friend Adrián Alberto Mojica, have shaken the island, raising international concern about the violence afflicting the country.Puerto Rico reported a record-breaking 1,136 murders in 2011, in a territory that is home to less than four million people. The island boasts more than double the number of police officers per resident, compared to the 50 U.S. states, and it still suffers a homicide rate of 26.2 per 100,000 people.Initiatives in and out of Puerto Rico against violence in the countryOn Dec. 15, Puerto Ricans will take part in the ""March for Peace,"" an effort to honor the deceased publicist and to demand a halt to violence during the holiday season.Meanwhile, in the mainland United States, Puerto Rican groups in exile have begun to organize meetings this upcoming Saturday evening in order to discuss problems the island is encountering and show solidarity for the difficult times their compatriots are living. Puerto Rican authorities are also looking to social media to reduce violence. According to the Associated Press, the government of Puerto Rico has started using Twitter in an effort to help reduce violent crime through the ""Follow To Unfollow"" (@ follow2unfollow) initative. The Department of Corrections will allow three male prison inmates to discuss their experiences in jail on the social platform, in an effort to show young people the reality of life behind bars.Correction: A previous version of this article stated that José Enrique Gómez was ""beaten to death and burned alive"".

185,Puerto Rico Status: White House Gives Mixed Signals On Statehood,Roque Planas,12/4/12,"The White House is sending mixed messages about whether it thinks Puerto Rico’s status vote should pave the way for Congress to consider making the island a U.S. state.After three weeks of silence, representatives of the White House have weighed in three times over the last week on Puerto Rico’s status, giving different statements each time about whether a November vote on the island's status amounted to a mandate for statehood.Luis Miranda, the White House’s Hispanic Affairs spokesman, told Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo Día on Monday that the Obama administration thinks a majority of Puerto Ricans voted for statehood. “The results were clear,” Miranda said, according to El Nuevo Día. “The people of Puerto Rico want the status issue resolved and a majority favored statehood in the second question.” Miranda’s comments came just hours after White House press secretary Jay Carney said the vote result was unclear.“The people of Puerto Rico have made it clear that they want a resolution to the issue of the island’s political status,” Carney told reporters, according to Politico. “Congress should now study the results closely and provide the people of Puerto Rico with a clear path forward that lays out the means by which Puerto Ricans themselves can determine their own status.”That’s the same situation Puerto Rico’s been in for over half a century, after four referendums since 1950 that have yet to show a majority of voters favor a change in the island’s status. Both comments diverged from the more diplomatic statement issued by the White House’s inter-agency group on Puerto Rico’s status, first reported Saturday by El Nuevo Día. The group’s co-presidents David Agnew and Tony West said they recognized Puerto Ricans are dissatisfied with commonwealth status and would work with Congress on the issue, without taking a position on whether the November non-binding referendum tilted toward statehood. In a two-part referendum, Puerto Ricans were first asked whether they wanted to maintain their current relationship with the United States. Some 52 percent of voters said they did not. The second question asked whether Puerto Ricans wanted the island to become a state, an independent country or a freely associated state -- but not whether they wanted to remain a commonwealth. Only 45 percent of voters supported statehood, but over 480,000 voters refused to answer the question. Of those who chose to answer the question, 62 percent favored statehood. Supporters of statehood, like outgoing Gov. Luis Fortuño, have latched on to the 62 percent figure, hoping to push their case before Congress. But the more modest 45 percent figure is consistent with the results of three other referendums since 1950 and months of polling leading up to the vote.

186,Advice for Puerto Rico's New Governor,"Gloria Bonilla-Santiago, Contributor",11/22/12,"Even after his election win, many of us in the United States still know very little about Alejandro Javier García Padilla, the new governor-elect of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a self-governing territory of the U.S. Here is what is known: He is a Puerto Rican senator-at-large and the president of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD). We also know he was the successful gubernatorial candidate for the 2012 election, defeating incumbent Luis Fortuño by a margin of mere percentage points.Perhaps I can offer some insight. I met Gov.-elect Padilla when he visited the LEAP Academy University charter school in Camden, N.J., this past summer. During my time with him, I was impressed with his commitment to making education a priority in working to overcome the state of poverty on the island. Having education as a key part of his platform was welcome news in our U.S. city, where many of the children who attend LEAP live in impoverished conditions like many children in the island. In fact, as many of 50 percent of the LEAP students are of Puerto Rican descent.Gov.-elect Padilla has his work cut out for him. According to the most recent U.S. Census, Puerto Rico has become an incredibly poor place. A quarter of the population lives in poverty, and the level of education is 22 percent, which suggests that the poverty rate has increased as a direct result of an underperforming education system. For example, 80 percent of teachers in the public school system do not speak English, while 63 percent of university students do not graduate. Sixty percent of public school students do not master basic skills in Spanish. Consider that only one in five Puerto Ricans has mastered English skills, thus reducing the bilingual labor market. Furthermore, the dropout rate in Puerto Rico is jaw-dropping. Twenty percent of Puerto Rico's population has less than a ninth-grade education. Only 25 percent have completed four years of high school. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate is almost double the U.S. mainland's rate. The labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico is one of the lowest in the world, with about four out of 10 people employed or seeking employment. This is an indication that a high percentage of Puerto Ricans find it better to depend on government benefits than to work. Even the businesses that thrive are doing very little to help the people who live in Puerto Rico. For example, U.S.-based businesses reap tax benefits as foreign investors, but their profits haven't been invested locally to fuel the infrastructure, growth and job development that were envisioned.Gov.-elect Padilla has many challenges and barriers to overcome if he is to be successful as leader of Puerto Rico, an island that remains split on the issue of statehood. Getting past these barriers will require a well-liked, trusted, strong leader with the courage to make the tough decisions to clean government and begin to reconstruction process.As an educator and native of Puerto Rico, I find Governor-elect Padilla's focus on transforming schools refreshing. My advice to him is this:Stand firm on your agenda to transform the island's educational system, and don't compromise.Identify a few trusted advisors who will tell you what you need to hear not what you want to hear.Remember, first impressions matter. Establish credibility and develop a reputation for getting things done.Know your job and take time to understand the mission, roles and work of the people who surround you.Gov.-elect Padilla, helping Puerto Rico's economy in the long term means keeping your eye focused on lifting the education system from its current state of disappointing underperformance.

187,Did Puerto Rico Really Vote for Statehood?,"Bennett L. Gershman, Contributor",11/14/12,"Headlines last week reported that a majority of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood for the first time in the country's history. The referendum had two parts. The first part asked whether the voter agreed with Puerto Rico's current status as a U.S. commonwealth, which was described on the ballot as Puerto Rico's ""current territorial condition."" By a 54 percent to 46 percent margin, the voters rejected Puerto Rico's current territorial condition, stating in effect that they would like to change their current status. The second part was entitled ""Non-Territorial Options,"" and listed three options: (1) Statehood, (2) Sovereign Free Associated State, and (3) Independence. According to news reports, 61 percent of voters supported statehood, 33 percent supported the sovereign commonwealth arrangement, and 6 percent voted for independence. However, a fair reading of the referendum results shows clearly that the headlines proclaiming that a majority of Puerto Ricans support statehood are misleading and erroneous, and certainly promote considerable cynicism regarding Puerto Rico's political process. Indeed, the votes of nearly half a million voters who did not support statehood were not counted. These voters deliberately left blank the second part of the ballot, in effect stating that they preferred a fourth option to the three options listed on the ballot. These voters likely would have supported a fourth option, choosing some form of commonwealth status similar to the current arrangement, but since this option did not appear on the ballot, would have checked a box marked ""other"" if such a ballot option was available, which it was not. The absence of this fourth option, and the reason for its omission, explain why the official results of this referendum are spurious, and certainly do not support the dramatic headlines proclaiming Puerto Rico's approval of statehood. As background, several points need to be emphasized. The ballot was prepared and counted by an election board appointed by the pro-statehood governing party (New Progressive Party). In calculating the results, the election board chose to exclude the blank ballots. Had the voters who cast blank ballots been counted in the total number of actual voters, then the total number of voters who supported options other than statehood -- i.e., sovereign free associated state, independence, and the ""other"" option of a commonwealth arrangement supported by voters who left this part blank -- would have been 55 percent, and the number of voters supporting statehood 45 percent.Moreover, the way the first question was presented -- ""Do you agree with Puerto Rico's current territorial condition?"" -- appears to have been deliberately framed by the pro-statehood party to make a ""Yes"" vote less likely, and to pave the way for a vote for statehood. Indeed, the term ""territorial"" in Puerto Rican discourse for most citizens is an incendiary word that is an affront to their national identity. Describing Puerto Rico as a territory of the United States is tantamount to insinuating that Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a U.S. colony. By the same token, a vote of ""No"" also presents problems for those voters who do not agree that Puerto Rico is a mere territory. These voters likely would support some other type of commonwealth arrangement, but do not support statehood or independence.It is not difficult to speculate why the pro-statehood election board did not provide a fourth option for those voters who rejected the three listed options -- statehood, independence, and the new and highly confusing option entitled ""sovereign free associated state."" Clearly, these voters would have supported some version of the existing commonwealth arrangement, but this was not an option. Excluding from the ballot a fourth option entitled ""other"" has been controversial, and has been litigated in the Puerto Rican courts. In a previous statehood referendum in 1993, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled that referendums must give voters the option to cast a vote for ""other,"" or ""none of the previous options"" if the voter is not satisfied with the way the options on the ballot are listed or defined. When the 2012 ballot options were announced by the pro-statehood government, the ""other"" option was deliberately omitted from the ballot. This omission was the result of a lawsuit which had been brought by the pro-commonwealth party, but now, the Supreme Court was comprised for the first time of a majority of pro-statehood judges, and the court overruled the 1993 decision and held that an option listing ""other"" is not required. It is ironic that the 1993 referendum was actually won by those who voted ""other"" who were dissatisfied with the way the ballot described the new commonwealth arrangement, the same reason that motivated those voters in 2012 to leave the ballot blank, since there was no place to vote ""other.""There is further evidence that pro-statehood supporters lacked a mandate from the voters. The pro-statehood governing party which proposed the referendum was voted out of office, the pro-statehood governor was defeated, the pro-statehood majority in the Senate was voted out of office, and the pro-statehood mayoralties in the cities also lost. Regardless of the ambiguous vote for statehood, there is little chance that Puerto Rico will become the 51st state, at least in the near future. Article IV of the U.S. Constitution authorizes both houses of Congress to admit new states by a simple majority vote, and the president's signature. But Puerto Ricans in the U.S. historically have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats, so it is unlikely that the Republican-controlled House would support Puerto Rican statehood, which would mean at least one new voting member in the House, and two U.S. senators. The only clear message from last week's referendum, if there is one, is that Puerto Ricans want to change their current status. The Puerto Rican economy is very weak, and the population is shrinking. A new political status is seen as imperative. Puerto Rico is a valuable asset to the U.S. Although Puerto Ricans pay no federal income taxes, they do pay at least billions of dollars in import and export taxes. A new status for Puerto Rico, even statehood, may be inevitable. However, it does not appear as yet that statehood commands a majority of voters, despite the big headlines.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-statehood_b_2118727,HuffPost,Liberal
188,"Puerto Rico Divided on Statehood, Majority Demands Decolonization","Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",11/13/12,"The opening line of President Obama's victory speech -- ""Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward"" -- felt ironic in Puerto Rico. On Election Day, the U.S. territory held its fourth non-binding referendum since 1967 on the question of status. To call Puerto Rico a U.S. Commonwealth, a term used in distinct juridical ways by other countries and states, euphemistically softens the power relations between the two countries, which began with a U.S. invasion during the Spanish-Cuban-American War, and became a Free Associated State in 1952. Advocates of Statehood for Puerto Rico declared a plebiscite victory, making headlines worldwide -- as far as Taiwan -- though the unusual mechanics of the ballot were largely ignored. Now the 61 percent vote for statehood is being more widely questioned.This discrepancy inheres to the ballot design, which the U.S. Congress had stipulated must contain the current status as a choice. The first part consisted of a Yes/No question, which contained the current status of U.S. territory: Do you agree to maintain the current political territorial status? Here ""No"" won by nearly 54 percent. For the first time since the first of four plebiscites were held in 1967, a clear, simple majority voted against the current status and for some form of decolonization.""Mas claro no puede cantar el gallo,"" opined Rogelio Torres Piña in a Facebook status update, with a popular expression featuring a rooster that sings clear as a bell.For those that voted No, three options followed in the second part ofthe ballot: statehood, independence, or sovereign free associatedstate. The official results were 61 percent, 5.5 percent, and 33.3percent, respectively. At least 26 percent left the second questionblank. The option of continuing current free associated status,without augmented sovereignty, was not among the choices for those whovoted Yes on the first question. Being a non-binding vote, theultimate authority for granting statehood remains with the Congress.The most common response heard about the plebiscite was a dismissive ""eso no va por ningún la'o"" or ""it's not going anywhere,"" reflecting cynicism that the U.S. would admit a Hispanic, Spanish-speaking state to the union (bilingualism is reportedly 19 percent). Some noted that Governor Luis Fortuño, who vigorously promoted statehood, lost the election, casting more doubt on the ballyhooed results of the two-tiered question.The statehood ""win"" of 61 percent did not include the more than 470,000 ballots left blank. Had ""none of the above"" been an option as in the last plebiscite in 1998, then the statehood vote would have been 45 percent, well shy of the simple majority of 51 percent required to petition the U.S. Congress for statehood. Although legally the votes left blank do not compute into the official percentage, the 61 percent reported does not accurately represent the preference for statehood. The 61 percent statehood vote trumpeted since has already been questioned because the second part of the ballot did not include the current Free Associated State status (known in Spanish as ELA or Estado Libre Asociado) as it was established in 1952, under the tutelage of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) and Puerto Rico's first elected governor Luis Muñoz Marín. Many ELA supporters voted Yes to continue the current status on the first question, and favor permanent union with the U.S., without full integration of statehood. Those who favored changes that would add sovereignty to the existing juridical status, and are called soberanistas, voted for the third option. Under the existing ELA, Puerto Rico competes internationally with its own Olympic Team and Miss Universe beauty contestants. With a more sovereign ELA, Puerto Rico perhaps could also conduct its own international trade and relations. More traditional and conservative ELA supporters left the second question blank, as urged by leaders within the Popular Democratic Party, as a protest to delegitimize the process, despite the risk that a blank ballot could be fraudulently filled. In addition, more than 17,700 ballots were purposefully submitted defaced or destroyed, and also did not count. ""Es una mogolla,"" said two sources, which in local parlance means it's a real mess. As there was no certain way to officially award the blank votes to ELA supporters.Those who voted No against the current status in the first question,in the second question split between statehood and independence, withindependence posting just over 4 percent. Both political movementsrefer disparagingly to the current status as colonial, thoughstatehood or annexation is perceived as surrendering Puerto Rico'slong struggle for independence, often repressed and persecutedthroughout the 20th century.Yet the pro-Independence plebiscite results do not fully capture the movement. As is their custom, the militant Nationalist Party boycotted the elections and plebiscite, and consider it an illegitimate colonial process, an opinion shared by small socialist groups, such as Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores (Socialist Workers Movement). Former political prisoner Rafael Cancel Miranda, the last of four surviving Nationalists who opened fire on the U.S. Congress in 1954, deemed the plebiscite ""a farce.""More moderate and influential independence groups such as the Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano (MINH), with some 3,000 members, urged a boycott of just the plebiscite, and endorsed candidates crossing party lines from the Puerto Rican Independence Party (Partido Independentista Puetorriqueño or PIP). Three new alternative parties from the left appeared, a sign of the deepening economic crisis and dissatisfaction with the political system. Julio Muriente, one of three co-presidents of the MINH, which is not a party, questioned the PIP strategy to focus on voting No with statehood in the first question. ""I think as independentistas we have to ask, which is more important to defeat, ELA or statehood?"" The scheduling of the plebiscite with gubernatorial elections was widely interpreted as a ploy to help the current pro-statehood governor, Luis Fortuño, also a U.S. Republican. Despite the advantage of a historically fragmented polity, Fortuño lost Tuesday's election by a slim margin to his chief opponent, Alejandro Garcia Padilla of the pro-status quo PPD party. Padilla's victory owes largely to pro-independence voters who were vehemently anti-Fortuño and crossed parties, called melones for the green and red colors of each party. Fortuño had fired nearly 30,000 public employees, expanded and stacked the Supreme Court, targeted the premier public university with crippling cuts, and instituted repressive policies that pitched the country into a civil rights crisis. While Fortuño's loss may belie the 61 percent statehood results, a vote for a party candidate may not translate into a status preference, as many may vote according to family custom, or to safeguard their jobs, as the government is the country's largest employer, and political discrimination a long-standing problem.Interpretations vary on what would be the U.S. reaction to the official ""pro-Statehood"" result. PIP faithful who rallied behind a No in the first question maintain that a statehood petition to the U.S. Congress would be rejected, thereby creating a juridical crisis that would end up in independence. ""It would go down like the Titanic,"" said Rafael Ruiz Ayala, an attorney and PIP supporter. Statehooder Carlos Colón de Armas, a University of Puerto Rico professor of business administration, disagreed and added that he's never believed in Congressional rejection, and less so now. Indeed the panorama has perhaps shifted in the U.S., now the second largest Spanish speaking country in the world, with Puerto Ricans as the second largest Latino group at 4.6 million, and with President Obama winning 71 percent of the Latino vote. Two of the three senior Puerto Rican representatives in the U.S. Congress, all Democrats, New York's Nydia Velázquez and Chicago's Luis Gutiérrez, criticized the plebiscite results as distorted. New York's José Serrano promised dialogue. A relatively new Republican Puerto Rican representative, Raúl Labrador of Idaho, was elected in 2010. Even hailing from a sparsely populated state, Labrador has more power than Puerto Rico's pro-statehood Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, who can advocate but not vote in the U.S. Congress on behalf of the 3.6 million U.S. citizens who live on the island. Because Puerto Rico is more populated than at least 20 other states, and despite a current migratory exodus, statehood would translate into five to seven representatives and two senators, plus presidential electoral college votes. Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917, in time to draft them into WWI, and have served in every U.S. conflict since.Fortuño has tried to sell Republicans on statehood by claiming Puerto Rican voters would support the GOP, and respond conservatively to such hot button issues as abortion or gay marriage. At home, Fortuño sells statehood with promises of increased federal aid. Such double discourse is ""a tough sell,"" said political scientist José Javier Colón Morera of University of Puerto Rico.The poverty rate in Puerto Rico is 45 percent, more than double Mississippi's, and experts claim socioeconomic factors would trump so-called Christian conservatism, translating into support for Democrats.Roughly 36 percent currently receive federal aid such as food stamps, up from 27 percent four years ago, according to UPR's Linda Colón, who has authored two books on poverty in Puerto Rico. She notes that statehood support cuts across all social classes, extending from welfare recipients to professionals and millionaires with ties to multinational corporations. Sectors profiting under the current scenario impede change, said Argeo Quiñones, an economist at University of Puerto Rico. Shifting from an economy that favors multinationals to one that cultivates entrepreneurship, local business, and community initiatives ""would require a radical transformation in social relations,"" he added, ""which a change in status would not automatically grant."" ""We are at a crossroads, and temporary measures no longer hold up,"" he concluded.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-divided-statehood_b_2118365,HuffPost,Liberal
190,Puerto Rico Statehood: Latinos Share Their 51st State Flag Mock-Ups After Island Status Vote,,11/8/12,"On Tuesday,Puerto Ricans voted on their preferred relationship with the United States. The largest share of voters elected to become a U.S. state.In a two-part referendum that caused some confusion, some 54 percent of voters said they were dissatisfied with the relationship. The second question asked whether voters preferred becoming a U.S. state, an independent country, or a freely associated state (a type of independence in close alliance with the United States). Some 61 percent of those who answered voted for statehood on the second question, though more than 460,000 people intentionally voted blank. Nevertheless, the recent ballot results have sparked real excitement in the community and it's been reflected best in the 51-state American flags we've been seeing floating around on social media.

189,Puerto Rico Statehood: 5 Reasons Why The Island Won't Become The 51st State,Roque Planas,11/8/12,"This week’s vote on Puerto Rico’s status, in which the largest share of votes supported statehood, got a lot of people wondering whether the island territorymay become the 51st state.But don’t hold your breath -- it isn’t likely to happen.The United States first colonized Puerto Rico in 1898. Since then, Puerto Ricans have voted several times on whether to become a state or not, but the idea has never become popular enough to sway a majority of voters. When statehood received the largest share of votes on Tuesday’s two-part status referendum, it led several U.S. outlets to report that a majority of Puerto Ricans had finally opted for statehood. It’s a misleading impression. The referendum consisted of two questions. First, it asked voters if they wanted to keep their current U.S. commonwealth status. Dissatisfaction emerged victorious with 52 percent of the vote. The referendum then asked if voters wanted to become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a freely associated state -- a type of independence in close alliance with the United States. Some 61 percent of those who answered the second question chose statehood. That 61 percent wasn’t the majority, however. Over 470,000 voters intentionally left the second question blank, meaning that only 45 percent of those casting ballots supported statehood. “The media in the United States have really taken it the other way, that statehood won, and that’s not true,” historian Angel Collado-Schwartz told the Huffington Post. Even without a majority, Puerto Rico is forwarding the results to Congress and the White House, which will decide whether to launch the process of turning Puerto Rico into to the 51st state in the union. Check out our five reasons why this probably won’t happen in the gallery above.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-state-reasons-will-not-become-51st-state_n_2095366,HuffPost,Liberal
225,Study: Puerto Rico's children mired in poverty that dwarfs rest of U.S.,Dania Alexandrino,8/1/12,"More than 80% of children in Puerto Rico live in high-poverty areas, according to a recent report. That's a sharp difference from national figures measured by the same study, which indicates that 11% of minors across the United States live in high-poverty areas. ""What this implies is that the children of Puerto Rico are facing really great difficulties in order to have the appropriate resources to develop. Whether it is because in their homes there are not enough resources or because in the community where they live there are not enough resources,"" said Nayda Rivera-Hernandez, senior research analyst at the National Council of La Raza. The study, released last week by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the National Council of La Raza using data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey, showed that the percentage of Puerto Rico's teenagers who are not in school or working is higher than in any U.S. state; at 18%, the rate is twice as high as the national U.S. figure, according to the National Council of La Raza. The report says 56% of Puerto Rican children live in poverty, compared with 22% for the entire United States. For the leaders of the communities along the Martin Pena Canal in San Juan, these statistics give a glimpse what their children live every day.  Of the communities' 26,000 residents, 23% are minors. Many of them go to school without supplies. And according to their directors, sometimes the schools themselves don't have the necessary materials for basic studies. But this isn't the greatest problem. One of the most worrying issues here is public health, community leaders say, because the community does not have a sewage system. On rainy days, water flows into the canal, forcing wastewater back into pipes and causing floods that sometimes reach inside homes. ""What keeps impacting us is the problem of polluted water. ... Our children have to put their feet in polluted water. The kids sometimes see little turtles that come out of the canal and they want to pick them up,"" said Lucy Cruz, a community leader. The canal community has more than 80 leaders who say they are actively working to improve the lives of residents -- and their children -- with or without the help of the island's government. According to the American Community Survey, Puerto Rico's poverty rate is about 45% -- three times the national U.S. figure. Puerto Rican government statistics indicate 640,000 families on the island receive food stamps. Rivera-Hernandez, of the National Council of La Raza civil rights group, said officials should devote more resources to helping families on the island. ""When a large majority of our children live in high-poverty areas, in single-parent families, and with parents who lack secure employment, we cannot ignore the threats to their well-being,"" she said. ""If we focus on helping families, then our children will do better. We must target our limited resources to strengthen our children's prospects and help prepare them for the future.""",https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/01/us/puerto-rico-child-poverty/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi0xcCa38j6AhWbQzABHRKyDRI4ggEQFnoECAIQAg&usg=AOvVaw1BpjCydWRVfxMmdjEghbyo,CNN,Liberal
226,Romney handily wins Puerto Rico's GOP primary,the CNN Political Unit,3/19/12,"Mitt Romney heads in to Illinois's presidential primary this week with a handy win in Puerto Rico, pocketing the territory's 20 GOP delegates in a bruising race that has become a numbers game for the Republican nomination.  With about 83% of total ballots accounted for early Monday in Puerto Rico, Romney had garnered more than 98,000 votes -- or 83% of the total -- based on unofficial results obtained from local party and election officials.  Rick Santorum was a distant second, at 8% with slightly more than 9,500 votes.  The other two candidates, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, were barely registered in the race with 2,431 votes, or 2% of the vote, and 1,452 votes, or 1%, respectively. Even as the vote was being counted in Puerto Rico, Romney, Santorum and the other candidates were already on the mainland vying for delegates in Illinois and Louisiana.  Illinois holds its primary on Tuesday and Louisiana on Saturday.  CNN's latest delegate estimates show Romney with 518 delegates to Santorum's 239. Gingrich has 139 delegates, and Paul, the libertarian champion, has 69 delegates. To secure the nomination, 1,144 delegates are needed. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, was in Louisiana late Sunday, where he is expected to win the primary. Romney was in Illinois where polls indicate he holds a small lead over Santorum, with Gingrich and Paul well behind. Romney framed his win in Puerto Rico as the territory's desire for a candidate that ""most represents their feelings"" -- and especially their desire to nominate some who can bring about a stronger economy and a smaller government.  He also said his party can appeal to Latinos, and win the presidency, with a low-tax, pro-business message. ""Those people who don't think that Latinos will vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico,"" said the former Massachusetts governor, noting that the territory's governor and its legislative leaders are conservative.  ""Hispanic voters are going to vote for Republicans if we stand for something -- conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values. That's how we're going to win, and we're going to get Latino voters to help us out."" Romney had entered the contest in Puerto Rico as the favorite. He was largely backed by the island government's political establishment, including Gov. Luis Fortuno, who campaigned with Romney last week. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, created a small political firestorm on the island in the days leading up to the primary when he said English should be the principal language in Puerto Rico before it could gain statehood. Puerto Rico will vote on a statehood referendum in November. After arriving in Puerto Rico on Friday, Romney said he would have ""no preconditions"" on language for Puerto Rico to gain statehood, though during a CNN debate in January he said English should be the nation's official language.  Santorum immediately hit back, accusing Romney of flip-flopping.  Romney fired back that English has been the official language of the government in Puerto Rico for more than 100 years.  The heated, see-saw allegations between the two candidates have marked much of the race for the GOP nomination, which Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called ""the nastiest I've ever seen"" during an appearance Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" Puerto Rico's primary came two days before the showdown in Illinois, where 54 delegates will be awarded proportionally and polls show a tight race between Romney and Santorum. Asked over the weekend while campaigning in Missouri about whether a win in Illinois would mean he'd win the nomination, Santorum said: ""We feel very, very good about it. Let's put it that way. Really good about it."" Santorum also challenged Romney's assertion that his business experience is one of his strongest credentials, telling CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that, ""If Gov. Romney thinks that he is the CEO of America and can run and manage the economy, he doesn't understand what conservatives believe in."" Romney's campaign released an ad in Illinois on Friday, attacking Santorum for having ""never run a business or a state."" Santorum on Sunday said he had experience in the private sector as a lawyer, but argued that executive experience at a company is not necessary to be commander-in-chief. ""Running a business is not the same as being president of the United States,"" he said. Santorum also gave no indication that he has plans to drop out of the race should his campaign reach a point where the delegate math doesn't add up in his favor. ""What I'm hearing is that we want a conservative nominee, that the establishment is trying to push a moderate like they did in 1976 against Ronald Reagan, like they did in 1996 with Bob Dole and what they did with John McCain,"" Santorum said. ""I think conservatives would like an opportunity to nominate a conservative, and that's an opportunity."" Both Santorum and Romney also focused their rhetoric at President Barack Obama, particularly with regard to rising gas prices.  Romney said Obama needed to fire Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar for their role in driving up gas prices. ""Given the fact that (Obama has) changed his policies, wants lower gas prices, he needs to fire them and return to the energy policies we need,"" Romney said during a town hall meeting in Collinsville, Illinois. Santorum told a crowd in Effingham, Illinois, to remember Obama at the gas pumps. ""When you see that zero come up, when it gets to the $100 range, when you see the zero, think of 'O' for Obama because that's why you are paying that extra amount of money,"" Santorum said.",https://www.cnn.com/2012/03/18/politics/pr-primary/index.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiYm8mq3cj6AhUURjABHWr9BOQ4bhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0PLqrFw9G6oPpYxgF6gKsE,CNN,Liberal
191,Rick Santorum To Puerto Rico: Speak English If You Want Statehood,Reuters,3/14/12,"* Puerto Rican Republican primary set for Sunday* Territory's November referendum will address statehood questionSAN JUAN, March 14 (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum told Puerto Ricans on Wednesday they would have to make English their primary language if they want to pursue U.S. statehood, a statement at odds with the U.S. Constitution.Santorum traveled to the U.S. territory to campaign ahead of the island's Republican primary election scheduled for Sunday, where he, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are vying for 20 delegates.Puerto Ricans, who recognize both English and Spanish as their official languages, are scheduled to vote in November on a referendum to decide whether they want to pursue statehood or remain a self-governing U.S. commonwealth.In an interview with El Vocero newspaper, Santorum said he supported Puerto Ricans' right to self-determination regarding the island's political status.""We need to work together and determine what type of relationship we want to develop,"" he told the newspaper.But Santorum said he did not support a state in which English was not the primary language.""Like any other state, there has to be compliance with this and any other federal law,"" Santorum said. ""And that is that English has to be the principal language. There are other states with more than one language such as Hawaii but to be a state of the United States, English has to be the principal language.""However, the U.S. Constitution does not designate an official language, nor is there a requirement that a territory adopt English as its primary language in order to become a state.Congress would have to give approval if Puerto Rico is to become the 51st state. Although Congress has considered numerous proposals to make English the official U.S. language, none has ever passed.However, some states have passed their own laws declaring English the official language, including heavily Hispanic Florida.Puerto Rico has about 4 million people and its population can vote in partisan primaries but not presidential elections. Puerto Ricans on the mainland have the same voting rights as other U.S. citizens.Santorum's statement may fall flat with Puerto Rican Republicans, who have always argued that issues of language and culture should be controlled by state governments and not the federal government.It also could alienate the 4.2 million Puerto Ricans who live on the U.S. mainland, including nearly 1 million in presidential swing-state Florida.Romney and Gingrich have both said Puerto Ricans must decide their future for themselves. Romney has said that if they choose to pursue statehood, he would help them achieve it.Romney, who is scheduled to travel to Puerto Rico on Friday and stay through the weekend, won the endorsement of Governor Luis Fortuno, who is also the head of Puerto Rico's pro-statehood New Progressive Party.Santorum was to meet with Fortuno on Wednesday before a town hall meeting with residents.He said he and Fortuno are friends because they went to the same church in Washington when Fortuno served as Puerto Rico's non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress from 2004-2008.Santorum also said that he does not support ""at this time"" allowing residents in territories like Puerto Rico to vote for president, although he said he was open to analyzing alternatives, such as allowing their votes to count in the popular vote but not in the Electoral College.Gingrich will send his daughter, Kathy Gingrich Lubbers, to campaign on his behalf in Puerto Rico on Thursday and Friday. She is fluent in Spanish and was expected to hold a town-hall style meeting.

192,A Different Kind Of Christmas In Puerto Rico (PHOTOS),"Christian Kallen, Contributor",12/22/11,"The sky is a deep tropical blue, rimmed with thunderheads and pierced by wind-surfing pelicans. Foliage is dense, deep green, bursting with unrepressed fecundity. It's a relief to come in out of the heat, stepping into the vast air-conditioned lobby with its tile and marble and views through broad windows to the Caribbean necklaced with surf. The smell of gingerbread fills the air.Gingerbread? Opposite the registration desk at the Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa in Puerto Rico is a full-size gingerbread house. A life-size Santa's eyes twinkle behind his toy-maker's spectacles, and wooden soldiers stand guard as a fire blazes inside the cozy, and edible, cabin. Okay, so the fire is a videotape, or perhaps a DVD, playing on a 32-inch screen nestled in the gingerbread fireplace. But the gingerbread walls are mortared with icing and crowned by gingerbread shingles. The cake cabin seems to invite children, perhaps Hansel and Gretel themselves, to explore the tempting hut.The gingerbread house is not quite large enough to rent out, except perhaps in Manhattan. The big beachside hotel on Puerto Rico's north shore has 600 rooms and 72 suites, so perhaps they don't need to find a roomer for this studio, but it is certainly large enough to sleep in on Christmas Eve, with visions of sugarplums (and, doubtless, gingerbread) dancing in our heads. For the past week we've been touring Puerto Rico, from the capital San Juan to Vieques Island offshore, on mid-December getaway. Much to our surprise every hotel lobby sports a spry Christmas tree, so densely festooned with ornamentation that any pine or spruce needles (real or otherwise) are obscured. It's as if being so far from the North Pole amplifies the need to celebrate the season, the yuletide spirit rising in inverse proportion to latitude.Jump to my photos of Christmas in Puerto RicoChristmas in Puerto Rico is a big deal, bigger than in most places and bigger than you might imagine. A blogger for Forbes.com recently listed it among the world's top Christmas vacations; another for CNN did the same. It takes its place with Amsterdam's streets, Finnish theme parks and the tree at Rockefeller Center as must-sees on a Christmas tourist's list. If what's missing is snow, reindeer and the building anticipation of a gift-giving glut, what's found is a party that lasts from the day after Thanksgiving to January 14, at least six full weeks of holiday spirit.""Christmas is a huge celebration in Puerto Rico,"" said Fernando Rosado of the Rio Mar resort staff. ""People just can't wait to get started once Thanksgiving is over.""But six weeks or more of celebration?""We don't want the party to end!""Perhaps it shouldn't be a complete surprise. After all, Christmas is a religious holiday, and Puerto Rico is heavily Catholic even now, 500 years after Pope Julius II authorized the first diocese in the Americas here. As much as 85% of today's population are Catholic, and another 8% are Protestant, who celebrate the holiday as well.But this isn't simply a matter of cards, trees and presents. A Puerto Rican Christmas is acknowledged as the central holiday of the year, with a mind-boggling series of festivals, traditions and musical celebrations that power the island's social life at the very time of year that tourism to the Caribbean island begins to take off, the winter months.This Christmas spirit prevailed throughout our journey not only with grandiose trees in lobbies and on patios but in street decorations, lights and adornments on houses and the sound of the distinctive aguinaldos, the lilting seasonal music most familiar to us through one of the standards of the season, ""Feliz Navidad,"" by Puerto Rican guitarist Jose Feliciano. Another holiday musical tradition unique to the island is the parranda, caroling in a Puerto Rican style. We experienced this in Old San Juan, when our walking tour of the Conquistador-era capital was interrupted by the accidental encounter with a group of a dozen or so hand-clapping, singing teens, guitars, horns and percussion instruments (maracas, tamboras, guiros), with a merrily prancing girl swirling her colorful skirt to the music. The parranda is essentially the gift of music, given by someone to his friends or business associates, a moveable party that grows as the parade goes on. Its spontaneity and festivity is infectious -- and it should be, as one of the conditions of the parranda is that the recipient is often expected to return the favor.Also in San Juan, fireworks were set off nightly, their booming explosions echoing off the tall buildings nearby. And it was more than a little weird to see haloed angels in Christmas lights hovering over the cobbled streets of the old Spanish capital, as if a Frank Capra movie were being adopted by Almodovar.The momentum of the Christmas holiday builds, with specific traditional feasts and celebrations occurring from early December through Nochebuena (Christmas Eve), the second biggest party day of the season with drinking and dancing lasting till dawn. Día de Navidad, Christmas day itself, is almost anticlimactic, especially if you've been up till dawn downing coquitos, coconut-rum eggnogs. Things pick up a week later with Despedida de Año (New Year's Eve), when people clean houses and dress in new clothes to set a good example for the coming year. Friends gather, champagne is drunk and shortly before midnight 12 grapes are gathered, one to be eaten each second in the countdown to the new year. Supposedly if you can eat all 12, you'll have prosperity for the coming year. If you choke on them... presumably you'll need CPR. As in many Catholic countries in the Spanish sphere, children are given gifts on January 6, El Día de los Reyes (Epiphany), marking the arrival of the Wise Men in Bethlehem. But things don't end there: For the next eight days a tradition known as Octavas continues, during which parrandas are commonly repaid and the musical street celebration can be at its height. It's as if they don't want the party to end in Puerto Rico, as I heard more than once. At least until the next one begins. But back to that gingerbread house at Rio Mar. Although it was erected in the days immediately following Thanksgiving, preparation began at least a month earlier, when plans for the structure were drawn up and the wood frame for the house constructed. Pastry chef Anibal Rodriguez, who with his staff of nine built the gingerbread house over an intense three week period, then gives over a full week to decorating the gingerbread house itself.A big but gentle man -- as befits a chef who specializes in house-sized confections -- Rodriguez still seemed to be reeling from the effort of putting together the gingerbread house. He recited the statistics as if taking solace in the effort: The house was 9.5 feet wide by 11.5 feet long and over 12 feet tall. According to the staff records kept, this is the 12th year that the hotel has built a gingerbread house. The staff labored for 540 man hours, taking 16 hours a day for a week to decorate the structure. (Hard to believe, but it's not the biggest gingerbread house in the world. According to Guinness, that honor goes to the Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minn., where in 2006 a 67-foot high cookie dough condo was built in 2006.)I noticed some broken shingles, some missing confections. It seems the house needs to be periodically repaired. Kids, and perhaps adults, like to sneak tastes from the gingerbread siding.Intrigued, I send a message to Rosado, asking if perhaps he could find out how many pounds of dough were used in the house's construction. He did me one better by sending my message on to Veronica Taveira, public relations manager for the Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa. And it was she who came up with the ingredients, as below:Flour: 1,930 PoundsCorn Syrup: 5 casesButter: 388 PoundsEggs: 11 casesGranulated Sugar: 130 PoundsPowdered Sugar: 396 PoundsWhite Chocolate: 382 PoundsGround Ginger: 5 PoundsGround Cinnamon: 5 PoundsGround Cloves: 5 PoundsAs far as how to put those ingredients together, you can check out this recipe online and, using the servings calculator, multiply by 900.

193,Will Puerto Rico Move Forward with Plans to Strip LGBT Residents of Their Hate Crimes Protections?,"Michael K. Lavers, Contributor",12/13/11,"A Puerto Rico tourism ad featuring adventure-seekers zipping through a lush jungle canopy and pristine white sand beaches ran on a Washington, D.C. television station on a recent chilly afternoon. Millions of winter-weary tourists from around the world flock to the Caribbean island each year, but there is trouble in paradise.Nearly two dozen LGBT Puerto Ricans have been murdered since Jorge Steven López Mercado's decapitated, dismembered, and partially burned body was found dumped along a remote roadside in November 2009. Ashley Santiago, Alejandro Torres Torres, and Karlota Gómez Sánchez are also among those whose names have been added to this grim list since the gay teenager's gruesome death sent shockwaves around the world. It would appear obvious that Puerto Rican authorities have a responsibility to protect the island's LGBT residents who continue to live in fear. The reality on the ground, however, is far different.Instead of strengthening existing laws designed to protect LGBT Puerto Ricans and other vulnerable populations, the Puerto Rico Senate last month passed a proposed provision to the island's penal code that would eliminate sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, and ethnicity from the hate crimes law. Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz backs the measure, while Pastor Milton Picón, president of Morality in Media de Puerto Rico, suggested to a local newspaper on Dec. 8 that LGBT-inclusive hate crimes laws normalize homosexuality.Really?A damning, 116-page U.S. Department of Justice Report in September on the Puerto Rico Police Department cited an inadequate response to hate crimes as among the PRPD's endemic deficiencies. The Puerto Rico Department of Justice's own statistics indicate that prosecutors have not convicted anyone under the island's hate crimes law.In response to the proposed provision, Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez urged Attorney General Eric Holder to launch a federal task force to investigate and prosecute hate crimes in Puerto Rico. New York City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, who was born in San Juan, was far more blunt.""The Puerto Rican government is creating a dangerous environment for those who have been and potentially could be attacked or even killed solely on the basis of their identity without any additional penalties for the perpetrators,"" she said in a statement released along with those from New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez and other elected officials on Dec. 7. ""This strategy to de-classify hate violence directed against LGBT Puerto Ricans and ethnic groups as a separate crime cannot stand. As a Puerto Rican committed to human rights and equality for all under the law, I will not stand silent to this injustice.""Governor Luis Fortuño, who has faced scathing criticism over his continued silence around anti-LGBT violence in Puerto Rico from activists on the island and on the mainland, indicated to reporters on Dec. 9 that he supports the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression in the island's hate crimes law. Has the international outcry over the draconian measure had some effect?It remains unclear as to whether the proposed provision will remain in the revised penal code that the Puerto Rico House of Representatives is expected to consider sometime in January. Legislators certainly have an obligation to address the skyrocketing crime rates that continue to terrorize Puerto Ricans. These remedies, however, should never come at the expense of the island's most vulnerable residents.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
194,Puerto Rico Hate Crime Law Would Exclude LGBTs Despite High Number Of Gay Murders,Mariana van Zeller,12/10/11,"Two years ago, on a desolate street in central Puerto Rico, a gay 19-year-old named Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado wassavagely killed: decapitated, dismembered, and burned. As of last month, his murder had still not been investigated as a hate crime -- a fact LGBT activists say reflects the failure of Puerto Rico's justice system to protect its gay citizens.Just months after the U.S. Department of justice released a report which highlighted the under-documentation of hate crimes on the island, Puerto Rico's legislature introduced measures that would remove protections from their existing hate crimes law for people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. According to reporter Michael K. Lavers for EDGE News, the Puerto Rico Senate already approved a provision that would ""eliminate sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity and religious beliefs from the hate crimes statute."" The House of Representatives is expected to vote on it this week in a legislative session convened by Gov. Luis Fortuño.The U.S. Department of Justice estimated that at least 17 members of the gay community have been murdered since 2010. Many advocates estimate the numbers are much higher. Yet, none of those murders have been classified as anti-gay hate crimes, according to the report. The DOJ insists that such numbers indicate a need for systemic change in the Puerto Rican Police Department's investigation processes. Joe Mirabella, Organizing Manager of Change.Org, wrote in a blog for The Huffington Post that U.S. Representative Nydia M. Velázquez spoke out against the proposal to amend the island's hate-crime law to eliminate protection for LGBT individuals. Mirabella quoted Velázquez as saying that, ""The current effort to weaken hate crime protections is an unconscionable affront to our community, and Puerto Rico's legislature should defeat it.""Singer and gay rights activist, Ricky Martin, has also made clear his disdain for the proposed legislation, saying that politicians behind the change are ""promoting inequality and hate."" ""They ought to do their homework and review a little the Universal Declaration of Human Rights...which says that everyone - the citizens - are equal before the law and have, without distinction, the right to equal protection under the law,"" he said in a statement on his website.A petition urging Puerto Rican representatives to strike down the proposal to amend the hate crime laws has already collected nearly 15,000 signatures on Change.Org. Myriam Mercado, the mother of a 19-year-old brutally killed two years ago, recorded a YouTube message in honor of her son. Looking into the camera, she thanked those who have provided her with support, and says, ""Steven was a human being. He was my son. He didn't deserve this."" She concludes her video with a simple ""message"":""Love conquers hate, and together we have strength.""

195,"Obama, Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans","Ray Suarez, Contributor",6/28/11,"Few political columnists in the United States are Puerto Rican. Few political columnists in the United States follow the twists and turns in the debates over the island's status closely, if at all. Yet, as the President boarded Air Force One for a five-hour visit to La Isla del Encanto you saw and heard it again and again; in newspaper columns, in cable TV commentaries, on radio and the web...the President's visit wasn't really about the almost four million American citizens living in the Associated Free State but really about the five or so million Puerto Ricans living on the mainland, many eligible to vote in 2012's general elections. Hey, on second thought, it wasn't even about all those Boricuas, only a minority of them. The ones in New York, Chicago, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, I was told with great confidence, are loyal Democratic Party voters in heavily Democratic states, so the President didn't need to make the sale. No, in fact, the Mr. Obama dragged the First Lady down to the heat of a Puerto Rican June to strut his 2012 stuff in front of the voters of Central Florida...who now include hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans who may, just may, dilute the Republican voting strength of the Miami-Dade Cubans. The President, you see, must win Florida to remain president after January 2013 and that's why he was in San Juan.Really?Please excuse my skepticism. At a time of heavy unemployment, home foreclosure, soaring public and private college tuition, painfully high gas prices, a 10-year war in Afghanistan, not to mention severe economic distress in Puerto Rico including a jobless rate almost twice that of the Mainland, Florida Puerto Ricans were going to make their choice based on an airport rally accompanied by Puerto Rico's Republican governor.When he was campaigning for president, and running in Puerto Rico's Democratic Presidential Primary, then-Senator Obama promised to visit the island as president, and to respect the stated wishes of islanders about their future status. If they chose the status quo of Commonwealth, statehood, or national independence, the candidate promised to take that seriously enough to urge the Congress to act. It was, in fact, an assurance little different from that made by American presidents for decades. Now President, Barack Obama repeated that assurance during his trip. For those of you who don't follow this issue, the status question is never as simple as it looks. Following a close second behind having the material necessities of daily life, the future status of Puerto Rico has shaped island politics since Uncle Sam first allowed the elections of a representative government and a native chief executive. The debate over status has distorted Puerto Rican politics in a fundamental way, by creating parties that take one side or another in the status debates rather than different political philosophies. The Populares, the party of the first Puerto Rican governor, Luis Munoz Marin, has defended Commonwealth since it helped invent it more than a half-century ago. The Progresistas are the party of statehood. The Independentistas want to end the 113-year old relationship that began with victory over Spain and annexation, and create a future for Puerto Rico as an independent nation.The current governor, Luis Fortuno, is a leader of the PNP, the New Progressives, and a member of the Republican Party. When he was Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner, a non-voting member of Congress, he caucused with the House Republicans. Every bit as much an estadista, and every bit as much a penepe, the current Resident Commissioner, Pedro Pierluisi, is a registered Democrat and caucuses with that party on Capitol Hill. We had a terrific conversation last week on Destination Casa Blanca covering the politics and policy of the President's visit, and giving a thorough airing to the debates over Puerto Rico's future. (You can watch excerpts at www.hitn.tv/dcb) If you are living on the Mainland, island-born, or Puerto Rican by heritage, what impact does the President's visit have on how you will choose in 2012? Does it have any impact at all? After his assurances that he'll respect Puerto Ricans' wishes after an upcoming vote, are you any more optimistic that the status question can be settled in some durable way?I wonder if the debate will ever be settled, or can ever be settled once and for all. After the last several plebiscites, and in repeated public opinion polls since, no preference gets much more than 50%. The pattern over the last 25 years has been sub-50% totals for both continued association with the United States and for statehood, with independence polling in single digits. The idea that a let's say, 54% vote for statehood would trigger a rush to put a 51st star on the US flag is a stretch. The idea that a pro-status quo margin of 51%-44%-5% would end the pro-statehood campaign because ""the people have spoken"" is also a little hard to believe. And while we're at it, are we all so sure that the Congress would rush to embrace a Spanish-speaking territory of 4 million people with a per capita income much smaller than the poorest of the 50 states? Would Puerto Ricans be ready to bargain on the primacy of Spanish in the daily life of their homeland? Before we get to those difficult questions, there's the matter of organizing a vote. The Puerto Ricans living elsewhere in the world do want to be heard on the future status of their ancestral home. But how? Should an architect in central Florida, a schoolteacher in the Bronx, and a bodega owner in Chicago get the same say on the future of Puerto Rico as a taxpayer and homeowner in Rio Piedras, Cabo Rojo or Humacao? When an American born and raised in Boston leaves for the warmer winters of California, can ties of culture, sentiment, loyalty, or passion convince the registrars of Massachusetts to let that Californian continue to vote in Boston? In the final analysis, is there something different about being Puerto Rican than being from Oklahoma or Texas? And can you make that argument at the same time as half of you are insisting that being from Puerto Rico is just like being from Oklahoma or Texas?Click here to watch more videos",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-puerto-rico-and-pue_b_885065,HuffPost,Liberal

197,Massive Turnout Against Police Occupation of University of Puerto Rico,"Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",2/14/11,"Student protests at University of Puerto Rico have mobilized a diversified public against the police occupation of the campus. On Saturday, some 15,000 marched along the main thoroughfares around the urban campus shouting in chorus ""¡Fuera Policía, Fuera!"" (Police, Get Out!). The turnout was largely in response to broadcast images of police brutality that began the Spring semester last week. As perhaps testament that protest is worthwile, today the majority of police were ordered out of the campus, a welcome change from last week's volatile start to the semester, if the decision sticks.The protest was triggered by a campus melee on Wednesday that led to 28 student arrests, including some who were merely en route to class. Serious injuries were reported. The day culminated with leaders of the professors organization APPU (Asociación Puertorriqueña de Profesores Universitarios) calling a 24-hour work stoppage, which was then supported by the staff union HEEND (Hermandad de Empleados Exentos No Docentes). A crowd of about 1,000 students formed and occupied the vestibule of the iconic clock tower housing Chancellor Ana R. Guadalupe's office. All the students arrested were later released without charges. Thursday afternoon, the Hermandad extended the walkout another 24 hours, leaving the campus desolate for a second consecutive day on Friday.The massive march on Saturday followed the resignation of University of Puerto Rico president José Ramón De La Torre, on Friday. In a letter dated Thursday, February 10, De la Torre requested that the Superintendent of Police, José Figueroa Sancha remove the police. Given the chronology of the request, it appears that De La Torre was the one removed. A widely shared belief is that top administrators are following a political agenda in which the ultimate goal is to dismantle and restructure the institution. In such conjecture, the strike is welcome as part of a government plan to justify closing the institution altogether. The origins of the strike lie in a student fee of $800 that could never be convincingly justified. ""The president's resignation shows a significant split over the purported need for the police occupation as well as the imposed fee,"" said Omar Ramírez, president of the General Student Council. In the letter to the police chief, De La Torre also reconsiders the role of distinct sectors in resolving the conflict, such as the professor and staff unions, and acknowledges the help of only one politician, Senate Speaker Thomas Rivera Schatz, seen as a future competitor to Gov. Luis Fortuño, though also from the right-wing flank of the Statehood Party. A more dire interpretation of De La Torre's letter is that the former UPR president wants to limit his liability in the event of more bloodshed or even deaths.Gov. Fortuño on Friday was in Washington, D.C., during this latest juncture in the UPR crisis, attending a Conservative Political Action Conference, which gathered such right-wing notables as The National Rifle Association, The John Birch Society and The Tea Party. He also finds himself defending his wife's lucrative business as a notary public for the banks of Puerto Rico, collecting a minimum of $250 per signature and reaping approximately a million dollars per year.  Also on Friday, came news that Gov. Fortuño had named a commission to assess the university for restructuring. Among the appointees is the former UPR president José M. Saldaña, who published demagogic Op-Ed pieces labeling the Colleges of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education as hotbeds of communist revolutionaries, despite their markedly heterogeneous political temperament. In contemporary U.S. terms, the rhetoric of Fortuño and his appointees sounds like a Latino Tea Party.""We appear to be in the first stage of a democratic dictatorship, a new absolutism,"" observed UPR Humanities professor Rubén Ríos Ávila.As institutional venues for redress become besieged, the courts and civic unrest are sites of active opposition. The summary suspension last Monday of student leader Giovanni Roberto was reversed on appeal and the ruling also deemed unconstitutional the chancellor's edict prohibiting all protest and assembly on campus. Hence Wednesday's campus protests occurred while the prohibition was annulled. By the end of the week, however, the university won an appeal, and the case will now be again appealed on his behalf.  ""Some of the most deeply rooted constitutional principles are at stake in this case after the administration of the University of Puerto Rico encroached on fundamental rights by establishing an absolute prohibition on free speech and the right to free assembly within the UPR campus,"" said attorney Frank Torres-Viada in a prepared statement.  Other reported abuses include police sexual harassment of female students. A complaint of excessive force against females being arrested was also filed in a governmental women's advocacy agency. These events seemed to touch a collective nerve, as intimated in this haunting video by student Luis R. Rosa, featuring a mother crying out as her only daughter is beaten by police. Potential violence from riot police was averted on last Monday's first day of classes when members of the Hermandad union and onlookers formed a human chain between student protesters giving speeches and riot police who had completely surrounded them and were moving in to make arrests. The riot police retreated after professors, staff and public alike spontaneously involved themselves in a show of collective moral force.  During Saturday's march, the number of protestors became so great as to be able to temporarily shut down and occupy a major highway in a massive sit-in civil disobedience. The march drew members from 72 civic and political organizations, and seen participating were professors from the College of Natural Sciences, notables from the arts, seniors, community groups from housing projects, clergy, Vieques activists and even members of the Fortuño administration.""I'm conservative and I work for this government,"" said one woman wearing a floppy hat to protect herself from identification and reprisals. ""But I grew up in a small town, and I owe my economic betterment to my UPR education, and my children were also educated here,"" pointing to the campus where heavily armed policemen were stationed. ""What the government is doing is just plain wrong.""",[],HuffPost,Liberal
198,"Puerto Rico Student Strike Intensifies, Public Education and Civil Rights at Stake","Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",12/15/10,"Coincident with massive, at times explosive, student protests in Rome and London, University of Puerto Rico has again become a flashpoint with a student strike beginning Tuesday that turned the main campus into a militarized zone of police, riot squads, and SWAT teams, complete with low-flying helicopters and snipers. What began as a conflict over a steep student fee hike is now seen as a larger struggle to preserve public education against privatization.Resistance to the imposed $800 student fee has triggered repressive state measures: police have occupied the main campus for the first time in 31 years and Monday the local Supreme Court, recently stacked by the pro-Statehood political party in power, outlawed student strikes and campus protests. More than 500 students defied the ruling by demonstrating on campus Tuesday, brandishing the slogan ""They fear us because we don't fear them"" (""Nos tienen miedo porque no tenemos miedo""). This current strike revisits accords to negotiate the $800 fee, which in June ended a two-month shut down of 10 of 11 UPR campuses, as UPR faces a $240 million budget shortfall precipitated by the state not honoring its own debt to the institution.Civil rights groups have declared a state of high alert in the wake of disturbances last week and statements by leading public officials seen as creating a hostile climate that inhibits free speech rights. In response, about 15,000 UPR supporters marched on Sunday from San Juan's Capitol building to La Fortaleza governor's mansion, under a balmy bright blue tropical sky in this U.S. Territory of about four million U.S citizens, though little known to most Americans beyond being a tourist destination.In the standoff leading up to this week, top university officials have repeatedly threatened that a strike may prompt them to shut down the main campus at Río Piedras, which serves 20,000 plus students, employs about 1,200 professors and 5,000 non-teaching staff, and hosts millions in scientific research funding (system-wide the UPR serves about 65,000 students). In addition, 10 of 11 University of Puerto Rico campuses remain on probation by its accrediting agency, The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, in the areas of long-term fiscal viability and effective administrative governance, of which the current student mobilization is a symptom, not a cause. Tensions mounted last week leading up to a two-day student walkout when Capitol Security, a private security firm contracted by the university for $1.5 million, demolished entrance gates to the campus. Hired guards were young with little or no training or evaluation, bore no identification badges and some were armed with sticks and pipes in a climate of intimidation perhaps not seen since dockworkers strikes of the 1940s. Many of the guards had been recruited from marginalized Afro-Puerto Rican communities, such as Villa Cañona in Loíza, which has been the site of documented police abuses, lending a disturbing dimension of institutionalized racism, according to community leaders there. Several violent incidents were reported, including a student who was seriously beaten and injured by guards. One video purportedly of students breaking security van windows was repeatedly aired in the local media as the justification for the police occupation of the campus, just as students had peacefully concluded the two-day walkout last Wednesday evening.""UPR has a long history of infiltrators and saboteurs involved to instigate such incidents,"" said William Ramírez, Executive Director of the Puerto Rico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. The purported incident capped off a series of provocations. Gov. Luis Fortuño in a televised appearance openly declared that leftists would no longer be tolerated on the campus. His Chief of Staff Marcos Rodríguez Ema publicly taunted that students and professors who dare protest will get their asses kicked out (""vamos a sacarlos a patadas""). The university administration has also designated areas limiting protests to outside the campus, and on Monday Chancellor Ana Guadalupe formally prohibited all protests or group activities of any type on the campus through January 15. The chancellor also issued an edict this week requiring all students to carry their student identification cards at all times.According to Ramírez, Fortuño's public statements targeting leftists, designated protest areas off campus and protest prohibitions are violations of constitutionally-protected First Amendment rights. The police presence and heavily-equipped riot squads also create a climate of intimidation that restricts expression, he added.""Rather than responding to violence, they have created a violent environment,"" Ramírez said, adding that under such conditions, in which a police occupation is deployed as a preemptive measure, ""it is almost guaranteed that violence will occur."" In response to the campus police presence, a majority in a meeting of about 300 professors Thursday voted to refuse to hold classes on campus while under siege, with senior professors recalling the trauma of deadly campus police violence during the last occupation in 1981. On Saturday, Police Chief José Figueroa Sancha announced plans for a permanent police precinct on the campus, using drug interdiction as the justification despite common knowledge that drug puntos or selling points operate a steady business a short distance from the university. Normally the campus operates with its own contingent of security guards.Some student leaders who are not pro-strike have also voiced complaints about the police takeover of campus. Omar Rodríguez, Student Council president for the College of Education and founder and editor of the 30,000+ member-strong Facebook page Estudiantes de la UPR Informan, reported that he was attacked without provocation by private security guards and that the police stood by and laughed when he pleaded for their intervention. ""The exaggerated police presence is unnecessary and intimidating,"" he said, adding that it was pedagogically absurd to expect students to concentrate properly on their studies in such an environment.Making the best of these tensions, student strike leader Giovanni Roberto reached out to dialogue with Capitol Security guards in working-class solidarity. ""They brought us the youth who are precisely the reason we are struggling, so that they could have access to the university,"" he said. It is estimated that the new $800 fee will force 10,000 UPR students to leave the university, though the state legislature and the Fortuño government have enacted last-ditch efforts to create funds for student jobs and scholarships. Numerous proposals from credible sources detailing fiscal alternatives to the fee seem to fall on deaf ears.The strike itself has yet to build broad support, however. Widespread concern that a strike will jeopardize the institution's survival has mobilized some against the strike, including students, despite majority opposition to the $800 fee. While students from other UPR campuses held walkouts or approved strikes, yet other campuses recently voted down such measures. And non-striking students at the Río Piedras campus, including previous strike leaders, signed a public proclamation to keep the campus open and classes running normally. Nevertheless, strike organizers are gambling that the blunders of the administration will win support for the striking students as well as mobilize other groups. The largest professors' organization, Asociación Puertorriqueña de Profesores Universitarios, and the non-teaching staff union, La Hermandad de Empleados No-Docentes, issued standard calls to members to respect pickets. And president of the UTIER electrical workers union, Ángel Figueroa Jaramillo, issued a public call for support from Tuesday's campus demonstration.Whether or not this current conflict has the potential to destabilize the Fortuño administration depends in part on a broader context of economic well being. Fortuño and a legislative majority from the extreme right came to power with a broad mandate to punish the previous party in power for the worst economic downturn in decades, with no mid-term or recall elections in Puerto Rico as a check on current policies.A self-described Reaganite, Fortuño has become a darling of the Republican Party for imposing highly unpopular austerity measures through legislation called Ley 7 (Law 7), laying off 20,000 public sector employees; targeting government agencies, including UPR, with crippling cuts aimed at perceived ideological enemies; and declaring null and void all public sector labor contracts for three years. Such a move, reminiscent of President Reagan's firing of striking air traffic controllers, should have stateside unions wary of Republican Party policy interest. In fact the fee as a mechanism to destroy the social mission of the affordable public university of excellence was instituted by then Gov. Reagan at University of California, which saw a 32% fee increase last November and an additional 10% more recently, despite protests and arrests there.It has also been reported that the Fortuño administration has already begun negotiations to sell off -- or long-term lease -- UPR campuses to private colleges, including those owned by major contributors to his campaign. And this just as a student loan default crisis associated with mediocre private colleges in the United States threatens to spiral into as costly a mess as the mortgage crisis.The events unfolding cohere with the popular thesis of Canadian author Naomi Klein, known as ""disaster capitalism."" However, students are mobilizing in Puerto Rico and worldwide around deep cuts to public higher education and subsequent privatization, in movements that may just be getting their first wind.""From San Diego to Rome, from San Juan to London and Amsterdam, 2010 will be remembered as the year of student protests internationally,"" commented Antonio Carmona Báez, Ph.D., a political science lecturer at the University of Amsterdam. ""Not since 1968 have university students stood up around the globe -- simultaneously -- against authority, this time to save public education.""Maritza Stanchich, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Puerto Rico.",[],HuffPost,Liberal

Wyndham Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa has Top-Notch Restaurants TooRio Grande's Wyndham Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa sits on 500 acres along a quiet beach. 600 rooms and suites in the creamy olive-colored building face the ocean or the El Yunque National Forest. Two pools sit near the shore. Greg Norman designed the challenging River Golf Course; the easier Ocean Course designed by Tom and George Fazio has great views; Golf Pro Rafael Prestamo gives smart tips that could improve even Charles Barkley's swing.

The Latino/Asian fusion cuisine at Shimas restaurant includes Oriental Mojitos (sake, lychees, lime and ginger ale), Pink Lady sushi (crunchy crab, shrimp, avocado and pink soy paper), tangerine BBQ Ribs, and orange ginger chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and raspberry infusion. The signature dessert at the Italian eatery Palio is the very decadent Fragole (tower of balsamic strawberries and vanilla ice cream with chocolate vipers). City and Sand in San JuanSan Juan, Puerto Rico's capital city, has a business district, cruise ship harbor and a brand new convention center (largest in the Caribbean). Most tourists seek lodging in the beachfront Condado neighborhood. Hotels, upscale stores (Cartier, Gucci, Salvatore Ferragamo) and restaurants (Ajili Mojili, De Parma Trattoria, Budatai) -- all within easy walking distance -- line Ashford Avenue which runs parallel to the shoreline and evokes Collins Avenue in Miami Beach or Avenue Alantica in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. At dawn and dusk, joggers chase the pavement (bring your Nikes). At night, pedestrians promenade up and down Ashford, as cars jam the avenue filled with mellow people headed to the bars, cafes and casinos. In and Around San JuanThe beach town experience meets urban environment when you travel on the newly completed rapid transit line, ATI (Alternativa de Transport Integrado), which runs 15 miles from San Juan to Bayamón, Puerto Rico's second largest city. The ATI ($1.50 per ride), a clean, quiet marvel of new technology, is the only subway/el system in the Caribbean and it shames New York City's dirty subways ($2.25 and rising). Tour the Bacardi Rum Factory (Highway 888, Catano), the world's largest rum distillery, and you'll learn the rum's history and how to make Mojitos, get free drinks and enter into the customary island debate: Bacardi vs. Don Q, which is the better Puerto Rican Rum? Check out Old San Juan: Visit the historic fortresses of Fort San Felipe del Morro (1539), El Palacio de Santa Catalina (La Fortaleza, 1540), and Fort San Crisobal (1783). Fill up on Nuevo Latino cuisine at The Parrot Club (try the Caesar salad topped with Chicarrones de Pollo). Snack on delectable mallorca, a donut-like flat bread topped with powered sugar, at the bistro-looking diner La Bombonera. Then decompress at the funky El Batey bar (101 Calle del Cristo), or live it up after midnight at the raggaetón nightclub, Club Lazer (251 Cruz Street).The Family Friendly San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris CasinoIf you're traveling with family and want a homey feel, the 513 guest rooms and 12 suites at the salmon-colored San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino beckon. The resort, in the heart of the Condado, has a 21-story tower and nine-story cabana section (cabana rooms are larger). Marble bathrooms and classic contemporary furniture give the hotel a warm ambiance. The extensive pool area features a waterslide. The beach scene is quite popular on weekends. At night, the Marriott lobby becomes a local watering hole; a band or DJ plays salsa music and people dance fervently, like they were at their daughter's wedding. The 12,700-square foot Vegas-style casino bustles, and its slot machines haven't forgotten how to give back a quarter. Puerto Rico offers a variety of experiences for those seeking a bit of jungle -- or pavement -- with their beach vacation.Visit travel writer Dwight Brown at www.DwightBrownInk.com.

200,University of Puerto Rico Student Strike Victory Unleashes Brutal Civil Rights Backlash,"Maritza Stanchich, Contributor",7/4/10,"As so many Americans gear up for Fourth of July fireworks this weekend, the U.S. Territory of Puerto Rico roils from a brutal civil rights showdown unleashed by a far-right wing government, now seemingly hell bent on destroying the recent unprecedented victory of a two-month long student strike against privatization of higher education at the University of Puerto Rico. The broader implications are crucial on numerous fronts, including the struggle to maintain broad access to public higher education and efforts to rein in runaway neoliberal economic policies that have wreaked havoc globally, resulting in draconian austerity measures worldwide. For the violence and repression seen in Greece and at the G20 in Toronto appears to now be visiting this Caribbean island nation of about four million U.S. citizens, the homeland of more than an additional four million Puerto Ricans in the United States, the second largest U.S. Latino group. While the economic crisis in Puerto Rico--the worst since the 1940s, if not the 1930s--has been deepening for years, and the current right wing government has aggressively implemented a hard-line, unpopular neoliberal economic agenda since its broad electoral victory last November, it appears as if the recent UPR student strike victory has touched off a firestorm, with a police attack on peaceful demonstrators at Puerto Rico's Capitol building on Wednesday injuring dozens, some seriously. The UPR strike concluded June 21 after a tense, two-month shut down of 10 campuses in a system serving nearly 65,000 students at the end of the academic year, with an accord that by all accounts was an unprecedented strike victory, in historic, hemispheric terms. A widely-supported student movement remarkable for its coalition building across traditionally distinct and even contentious social and political sectors coalesced against threatened erosion of broad public access to the widely-regarded state university, as well as its increasing privatization. With tensions high after police and riot squads had attacked and injured students, their parents and journalists on at least three occasions, an agreement finally reached through judicial mediation met with the students' basic demands, reinstating canceled tuition waivers, temporarily forestalling a tuition hike or imposition of student fees, and protecting strike leaders from summary suspension reprisals. The accord, signed by a majority of the Board of Trustees, though those refusing included the university and board presidents, was hailed as an achievement in civil conflict resolution, especially in light of the history of previous UPR strikes that had ended in deadly violent repressions. Immediately after however, the Puerto Rico state legislature, dominated by the extreme right of the local Pro-Statehood party, rapidly expanded the university Board of Trustees, with the governor approving four new appointees, and a new but divided board quickly imposed a $800 student fee starting in January, and made it permanent, reminiscent of the imposition of fees at University of California by then Gov. Ronald Reagan. The legislature also quickly dismantled a long-standing UPR tradition of student assemblies, replacing them with private electronic computer voting devoid of open debate. Other cuts were also implemented affecting professors and adjunct instructors, who now make up about 40 percent of the UPR faculty, following trends in the United States, where 60 percent of all professors occupy such increasingly precarious positions. In a far worse economic straits than the states of California or Michigan, Puerto Rico is confronting its worst fiscal crisis in decades, and UPR the biggest fiscal crisis of its 100-year existence. As in other countries facing related circumstances, virulent and organized opposition to drastic cuts principally directed at the working and deteriorating middle classes has mushroomed, especially since the current global crisis, in Alan Greenspan's own befuddled words, was caused by greed-induced corruption among the highest echelons of the world economy. While the neoliberal economic agenda of Puerto Rico's current political leaders look back to the very doctrines now being challenged in the United States and throughout Latin America, the UPR student movement embodies the vanguard of the contemporary 21st Century, as reflected by their symbols and tactics, including the democratizing internet; egalitarian rainbow flags; sustainable organic farming; an effervescence of alternative arts; and new coalition building among center, right and left; in tandem with occupation practices inspired by international student movements as far as California, Spain, France and Greece. Though a shocking collective trauma, the violent crackdown at the Capitol Wednesday was not entirely surprising given the current administration's assault on all fronts since coming into power, targeting progressive, cultural and social welfare institutions and agencies with crippling budget cuts, attempting to dissolve Puerto Rico's bar association, lifting environmental protections to whole swaths of protected lands, and passing a now notorious law, called Ley 7, that not only dismisses 20,000 public employees, but declares null and void all public sector union contracts for three years, with the only recourse to challenging the law being to petition the local Supreme Court, now stacked with new appointments in the administration's favor. The governor has also activated the National Guard for civilian purposes, amidst criticism from groups such the Puerto Rico chapters of the ACLU and Amnesty International. Common in Puerto Rico, however, though unusual at most U.S. state universities, is the way political parties assume control of UPR leadership by appointing a new president, also recently achieved. This is in part because the UPR is widely regarded as national patrimony, and is one of the few places left in the country where dissent may be cultivated. As opposition to these policies expands, as seen in a massive national strike in October that drew a quarter of a million workers into the streets, so has the government's seeming intolerance to any opposition, as Gov. Luis Fortuño, Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz and UPR president José Ramón de la Torre regularly resort to Cold War era red-baiting with media campaigns labeling protestors as Socialists, Communists, and professional rabble rousers out to destabilize the country. The clamp down has so far gone as far as banning journalists from Senate chambers for four days last week during the country's budget sessions, prompting media organizations to petition in court to regain access. ""I don't think there is any doubt that the intention of this government is to set back civil rights,"" said Judith Berkan, a long-time civil rights attorney and a law professor at University of Puerto Rico and InterAmerican University in San Juan, adding that the administration has enacted a staggering number of measures to neutralize and debilitate all those perceived as a threat to a local oligarchy acting in concert with U.S. interests. Attempts were made to reach Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress, and UPR President José Ramón de la Torre for comment, but they were not available at press time. The irony that the Pro-U.S. Statehood party of Gov. Fortuño is now curtailing the most basic press and civil liberties is not lost on UPR student strike leaders who witnessed and were injured at Wednesday's melee, including those who belong to the pro-Statehood party themselves, and voted for the sitting governor. ""It pains me as a statehooder that this government has not learned the lessons of U.S. civil rights struggles of decades ago,"" said Aníbal Núñez, a student at the UPR law school and a member of the student negotiating committee. Núñez acknowledged the participation of students affiliated with Socialist groups among strike leaders and the student negotiating committee, and said they overcame their differences via universal concerns for education as a social necessity, as they gained each others' respect while coalition building together, adding that if he could not overcome ideological differences enough to collaborate, he would still believe in their right to pluralistically exist. The notion that accessible, quality higher education contributes to economic recovery runs counter to the widening U.S. trend of students graduating with crippling debt, as public education has for years now faced diminishing state support. A common argument used by the administration during the UPR strike was its affordable tuition, at less than $2,000 per year for undergraduates before the recently imposed fees. But while tuition is cheaper than probably any other state university in the United States, average income in Puerto Rico is also far lower than any other U.S. state, with about 48 percent of the population living in poverty as defined by U.S. federal standards, and the cost of living in San Juan at least, far higher than at oft compared institutions in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, or Oxford, Mississippi. This tradition of maintaining broad public access to a quality state institution of higher learning is a hard earned point of pride at UPR, compared to institutions that have recently reneged their public mission with sudden and steep fee/tuition increases, such as at University of California, where students also opposed, occupied and met with police repression, but could not stave off a 32% fee hike imposed in November. As UPR administrators continue to grapple with what was a nearly $200 million budget shortfall for next year going into the strike, in search of additional or alternative fund-raising or saving sources, an emboldened student movement will also regroup and weigh all its options. Future conflicts may be averted by altering the very style of governance at UPR, a top-down and paternalistic holdover from the past, as this could go a long way toward making students, as well as professors and staff who also have large stakes at play, part of a give-and-take process. For come what may in the global fiscal crisis in the coming decade, these students are the future of new Americas of increasingly porous borders and dramatic, rapid demographic, political, cultural, informational and economic shifts, as the old order, the vestiges of the Cold War in Puerto Rico and in South Florida for example, fade into the proverbial sunset. ""We may not hold the power but we have the will power,"" stated law student Núñez, ""and given the choice, I prefer the latter."" UPR administrators and Statehood party leaders would do well to recognize and reach out to the productive potential of this new power, shift gears and learn to act on the principles they purportedly hold dear.

201,"Deportation Nightmare: Eduardo Caraballo, US Citizen Born In Puerto Rico, Detained As Illegal Immigrant",,5/25/10,"Eduardo Caraballo, a U.S. citizen born in the United States, was detained for over three days on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant.Despite presenting identifying documents and even his birth certificate, Caraballo was held by federal immigration authorities over the weekend and threatened with deportation, according to an NBC Chicago report. He was only released when his congressman, Luis Gutierrez -- a vocal supporter of immigration reform -- intervened on his behalf.(Scroll down for video of Caraballo and Rep. Gutierrez.)Caraballo was born in Puerto Rico, making him a natural-born citizen of the United States. He moved to the mainland as an infant, and now lives in Chicago.Last week, NBC reports that he was arrested in connection with a stolen car in Berwyn. Caraballo maintains his innocence. In any case, when his mother posted bail on Friday, he was not freed.""Instead of being released, he was told by authorities that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was detaining him because he was an illegal immigrant,"" NBC reports.Caraballo spent the weekend in the custody of federal immigration agents. When he presented them with ID and his birth certificate, he says officials were skeptical: ""Because of the way I look, I have Mexican features, they pretty much assumed that my papers were fake.""Only after his congressman interceded was Caraballo set free.Rep. Gutierrez, a Chicagoan who is himself of Puerto Rican descent, is a long-time advocate of immigration reform. He was one of the first and loudest voices on the Hill to speak out against the Arizona immigration law, and he was recently arrested at a protest demanding fairer treatment for immigrants and their families.""It gets worse,"" Gutierrez said in an interview. ""We know of instances in which young people in his same situation are actually taken to the border and deported from the United States.Not surprisingly, the nine-term Democratic congressman saw a disturbing connection to the situation in the Grand Canyon State.""In Arizona, they want everybody to be able to prove they're legally in the country. They want everybody to prove that they're an American citizen. Here we had an American citizen, that the federal government... could not determine, for more than three days, his status as an American citizen. It's very, very, very dangerous ground to tread.""According to NBC Chicago, Caraballo ""is considering legal action."" Meanwhile, he and his congressman hope the incident will open people's eyes to the dangers of profiling.Watch Eduardo Caraballo and Luis Gutierrez speak to NBC reporters:",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deportation-nightmare-edu_n_588788,HuffPost,Liberal
202,Puerto Rico -- the Next Red State?,"Steve Garcia, Contributor",8/27/09,"Last Wednesday, July 22, HR 2499, the Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2009 introduced by Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi (the Island's representative in the Congress) was voted on by the House Natural Resources Committee with a 30-8 win for Mr. Pierluisi (8 Republicans voted yea and 7 voted nay). It now goes to the full floor.This should not come as a surprise, since President Obama promised during the campaign that he would support Puerto Rico's attempt to determine their political future. What is most surprising is that, historically, Puerto Ricans lean more to the Republican side of the isle since that side has expressed greater support than the Democrats. Congressman Pierluisi argued that his constituents chose him knowing that he would caucus with the Democrats. What he may not tell you is that he ran with the endorsement of a Republican, Luis Fortuno, Puerto Rico's Governor. In the United States a congressional candidate does not ""run"" together with a candidate for Governor. They may do some campaign appearances together, but it stops there. In Puerto Rico you would hear slogans such as ""El momento del Cambio es AHORA con Luis Fortuño y Pedro Pierluisi"" ""The moment of Change is NOW with Luis Fortuno and Pedro Pierluisi"". Campaign posters would have both of their photos. Our ""state"" legislature is overwhelmingly conservative. The political parties on the Island have no affiliation to the platforms of the U.S. political parties, and conservative politicians can be found in all Puerto Rican parties. Efforts against, for example, abortion rights and gay marriage have received overwhelming support. If a conservative agenda is not always successful it is simply because politicians rarely cross party lines in order to garner the support needed to make it happen.Should Puerto Rico become a state it would add two senators and seven representatives to the Congress; we should expect that these new members will come from the same conservatives that now hold office in the ""state"" legislature. Once political enemies are likely to become friends under a conservative American party. Democrats and Republicans have known this for decades. It took a new kid in town to make a promise that he may end up regretting. But a promise is a promise, and Democrats seem to be willing to go along with it.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico--the-next-red_b_245886,HuffPost,Liberal

204,Let's Listen to the Voters of Puerto Rico,"Gerald McEntee, Contributor",5/15/08,"(También disponible en español.)While the race for the Democratic presidential nomination is coming to a close, it is important that we not end it before all the voters have a chance to be heard. It has been a tough battle, but the race has also produced some great benefits for the Democratic Party. The 2008 primaries and caucuses have brought new activists into politics, increased our party's ability to raise money and laid a solid foundation for success in the fall. Whether Hillary Clinton, AFSCME's choice, or Barack Obama is the candidate come November, a vibrant and re-energized Democratic Party will be united against John McCain and his promises of a third Bush term and 100 more years in Iraq. As I have traveled around the country during the last few months, I have seen the excitement the presidential campaign has generated among Americans who have a sense that our government no longer works for them. They are excited to have a chance to participate in primaries and caucuses, and to elect a President who will be on their side. In every state where Senators Clinton and Obama have battled it out at the polls, Democratic registration is up significantly, a positive sign that turnout in November could reach historic proportions. Democratic voters are ready and when the primary season ends, we will have a strong candidate for the general election. Just as importantly, we will have a strong base of activists to turn out the vote and then turn our country around.Nowhere is that more true than in Puerto Rico, where Democrats will vote on June 1. Although Puerto Rico has no Electoral College votes, Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They pay taxes. Today, their sons and daughters are serving and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan. Puerto Rico has 55 delegates and 8 super delegates who will vote at the Democratic Convention, more delegates than 21 of the states. Puerto Rico deserves to be heard in the Democratic race for President. As the chair of Barack Obama's campaign in Puerto Rico put it this week: ""As a Puerto Rican I know this is our chance to engage the candidates on issues that matter to our island."" On issues ranging from health care to the economy, the voters of Puerto Rico want to be heard. AFSCME's affiliate in Puerto Rico, Servidores Públicos Unidos recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of winning their right to collectively bargain for better working conditions and benefits. After a long, hard fight in the largest organizing drive in America, the public service workers of Puerto Rico are now organized – 120,000 workers strong. Those unionized workers want to be heard not only in the workplace, but also at the ballot box. The Puerto Rico primary gives them that chance to be heard. The campaign season will be coming to an end shortly, yet some pundits want it to end right now. That would deny the voters in Puerto Rico their chance to have a say. At every step in this long primary process, whenever the experts said the race was over, the voters proved them wrong. The voters have been electrified by the campaign. More than a million voters in Puerto Rico deserve a chance to have their voices heard. They deserve a chance to vote before this historic nomination battle is prematurely called to an end.",[],HuffPost,Liberal
