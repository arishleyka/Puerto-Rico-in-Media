Judge approves plan to reduce Puerto Rico agency’s debt,No Author,10/12/22,"A federal judge on Wednesday approved a plan to restructure some $6 billion of debt held by Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority as the U.S. territory emerges from bankruptcy. The plan cuts the agency’s debt by more than 80% and saves Puerto Rico more than $3 billion in debt service payments, according to Gov. Pedro Pierluisi and a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances. “The plan creates a solid financial foundation to ensure Puerto Rico’s roads and public transportation are maintained and improved,” the board said. It has previously noted that 13% of the island’s highways are in good condition, compared with a median of 84% in the U.S. mainland. Only one government agency on the island has yet to restructure its debt: Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which holds some $9 billion in debt, the largest of any public agency. Federal Judge Laura Taylor-Swain recently ordered a new round of mediation talks to resolve that debt after the previous talks failed. She also allowed the board to go to court to determine how much money bondholders seeking to recover their investments should receive. The debt restructurings come after Puerto Rico’s government announced in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.","https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-puerto-rico-2dfa1b6f8c97afd535e890288bbea68e

"About 82,000 still without power in Puerto Rico two weeks after Fiona",Reuters,10/6/22," Around 82,000 homes and businesses were still without power in Puerto Rico on Thursday, over two weeks after Hurricane Fiona caused an islandwide outage for its 3.3 million people.

Biden to storm-hit Puerto Rico: 'All of America's with you',Jeff Mason,10/3/22," President Joe Biden on Monday pledged more than $60 million in aid to help U.S. territory Puerto Rico and said more money was coming, as he sought to present a more compassionate image than his predecessor, Donald Trump, while surveying damage from Hurricane Fiona. Soon after arriving with his wife, Jill Biden, the president met with victims of the hurricane, which left Puerto Rico without power for an extended period. Biden will travel to Florida on Wednesday to see damage from Hurricane Ian. ""We came here in person to show that we're with you. All of America's with you as you receive and recover and rebuild,"" Biden said in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Biden alluded to the controversy surrounding Trump's response to Hurricane Maria when it ravaged Puerto Rico in 2017, killing thousands. Some residents of the island said Trump was slow to dispatch aid in the wake of that hurricane. Trump objected to sending more money to Puerto Rico after the hurricane and froze billions intended for the island, a move Biden has reversed. ""Yes, Puerto Rico is a strong place and Puerto Ricans are a strong people, but even so you have had to bear so much, more than need be, and you haven't gotten help in a timely way,"" Biden said. Biden said the $60 million would help rebuild coastal regions. He was joined by Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell. The funding will help ""shore up levees and flood walls, and create a new flood warning system to help residents better prepare for future storms,"" Biden said in a Twitter post. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico is neither a U.S. state nor a sovereign nation, and residents do not have voting rights unless they move to the mainland. Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi, speaking before Biden, said: ""We want to be treated in the same way as our fellow Americans in the states in times of need. All American citizens, regardless of where they live ... should receive the same support from the federal government."" Biden listed recent investments in Puerto Rico's roads, bridges, mangrove restoration and coral reefs included in recent funding bills from the U.S. Congress, and said more money was coming. ""I'm ready to deploy and expedite more resources from the Department in Energy and other federal agencies,"" so that residents can get clean, reliable power, he said. The Biden administration is monitoring the impact of Hurricane Ian on the insurance industry, Criswell told reporters aboard Air Force One. She  said last week  that the damages from Ian would be catastrophic. ELECTRICTY RESTORED Stormravaged residents in Florida and the Carolinas alone  face a disaster recovery  expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. Hundreds of thousands of people have struggled without power since Fiona hit Puerto Rico some two weeks ago. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Sunday said that power had been restored to 90% of customers on the island. ""This is an important milestone, coming just 13 days after Fiona made landfall,"" she said. ""While we're grateful for this progress, we realize the work is not over. Efforts to rebuild and help those impacted will continue."" Last week the Biden administration  approved  a waiver of U.S. shipping rules to address Puerto Rico's immediate energy needs.

Officials detail Hurricane Fiona damage to Puerto Rico grid,DÁNICA COTO,9/29/22,"Preliminary evaluations show Hurricane Fiona damaged 50% of transmission lines and distribution feeders across Puerto Rico as hundreds of thousands remain without power or water service almost two weeks after the storm hit, officials said Thursday. The announcement came as a major power plant in Puerto Rico was knocked offline and began to spew heavy black smoke in the latest setback to efforts to stabilize the U.S. territory’s power grid. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said crews were working swiftly to restore essential services, but stressed that he was not satisfied that more than 270,000 clients out of 1.47 million were without power and more than 100,000 clients out of 1.2 million without water service. The situation has angered and exasperated many who already were affected by power outages blamed on Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that razed the island’s power grid in September 2017. Hurricane Fiona slammed into Puerto Rico’s southwest region as a Category 1 storm Sept. 18. “We are living in a state of eternal fragility,” said Puerto Rico Rep. Mariana Nogales. Luma, a private company that operates transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, has promised that electricity would be restored to 90% of clients by Friday in areas not severely affected by the storm. In hard-hit areas, officials have said they might restore power to 90% of clients by next Thursday. “I’m demanding more,” Pierluisi said. Officials have not said when the entire island might be energized. The lack of power has led to dwindling diesel supplies and prompted U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to announce Wednesday night that he would temporarily waive a federal law to allow for a British Petroleum ship to dock in Puerto Rico and unload 300,000 barrels of diesel. The outage has forced businesses including grocery stores and gas stations to temporarily close and prevented hundreds of schools from opening. In addition, 16 government medical clinics and seven dialysis centers are still operating on generators. In a policy brief released Thursday, the Puerto Rico-based think tank Center for a New Economy said Puerto Rico already was extremely vulnerable prior to Fiona because only 30% of permanent reconstruction work related to 2017′s Hurricane Maria had started. “Basically, nothing had been done to strengthen the electric grid and other critical infrastructures or increase their resiliency,” the center said. “The damage caused by Hurricane Fiona will certainly add another layer of complexity on top of what was already a difficult and complicated effort.”","https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-caribbean-storms-power-outages-puerto-rico-5d54ac54f0cc1b69c3c2294a4638d9db

US waives federal law to boost diesel supply for Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,9/28/22,"The U.S. government announced Wednesday it would temporarily waive a federal law and allow foreign diesel deliveries to Puerto Rico as it faces a dwindling supply of fuel nearly two weeks after Hurricane Fiona pummeled the U.S. territory. The announcement comes a day after Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, the archbishop of San Juan and others requested that U.S. President Joe Biden temporarily suspend the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, best known as the Jones act, which requires that all goods transported to the island be aboard a ship built in the U.S., owned and crewed by U.S. citizens and flying the U.S. flag. Homeland Security Security Alejandro Mayorkas said he temporarily waived the law “in response to urgent and immediate needs of the Puerto Rican people” so they could have “sufficient diesel to run generators needed for electricity and the functioning critical facilities as they recover from Hurricane Fiona.” Pierluisi had warned diesel supplies on the island were running low in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona and noted that a British Petroleum ship with 300,000 barrels of diesel has been floating off Puerto Rico’s southern coast since Sunday, awaiting entry. More than 311,000 customers out of 1.47 million remain without power more than 10 days after Fiona slammed into Puerto Rico’s southwest tip as a Category 1 storm, sparking an island-wide blackout. Several hospitals also remain connected to generators. “It is totally unacceptable,” said Manuel Calderón Cerame, spokesman for the main opposition Popular Democratic Party. Fuel disruptions have forced grocery stores, gas stations and other businesses to temporarily close as the demand for diesel to feed generators grows. Hundreds of schools also remain shuttered. On Wednesday evening, Luma, a private company that operates power transmission and distribution in Puerto Rico, announced it would take at least another week to restore electricity to 90% of customers in the island’s southern and western regions. “Hurricane Fiona severely impacted critical parts of the electric grid and generation facilities across Puerto Rico, especially in the Ponce and Mayagüez regions that suffered severe damage to roads and critical infrastructure,” the company said. Officials have not yet said when they expect the island to be fully energized. As of Wednesday night, power had been restored to 80% of 1.47 million clients, the majority in the capital of San Juan and nearby areas. Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which operates generation on the island and is working with Luma to restore electricity, also is struggling to restructure more than $8 billion in debt. Earlier Wednesday, a federal judge ordered a fresh round of mediation talks aimed at restructuring the company’s public debt. U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain also allowed a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances to go to court to determine how much money bondholders should receive as they seek to recover their investments. The board warned earlier that any expenses linked to debt repayment would be passed along to the power company’s 1.47 million clients. The board also was ordered to file a debt-restructuring plan for the island’s Electric Power Authority by Dec. 1, with a confirmation hearing scheduled for mid-2023. The board praised the ruling in a brief statement, saying it is calculated to get major disputed legal issues resolved in the shortest possible time: “Simultaneous litigation and mediation facilitates resolutions for all constituencies.” In early March, Pierluisi had announced that his administration was scrapping a proposed debt restructuring deal because it was not favorable to the island’s economy or the power company’s clients. Then on Sept. 16, officials announced that mediation talks had failed. In response, a bondholder group that holds or insures 65% of the power company’s debt sought to have the bankruptcy case dismissed and a receiver appointed.  On Wednesday, the judge denied their request. A spokesman for the bondholder group did not return a message for comment. The power company holds the largest debt of any of Puerto Rico’s government agencies, and it is one of two agencies whose debt has not yet been restructured more than five years after the U.S. territory filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in history. Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority still holds $5.8 billion in debt.","https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-caribbean-puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-93c537d7b51040ab2a277deb4359031d

Puerto Rico seeks U.S. waiver as diesel dwindles after storm,DÁNICA COTO,9/28/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Tuesday requested that the U.S. government waive a federal law to allow for more fuel shipments to the island amid concerns over a dwindling supply of diesel in the wake of Hurricane Fiona. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi warned that a shortage of fuel would affect public health, security and government functions in the U.S. territory. “Diesel supplies continue to decrease at a higher rate than previously anticipated, and shortages have been reported around the island,” he wrote. The law that Pierluisi references is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, best known as the Jones act, which requires that all goods transported to Puerto Rico be aboard a ship built in the U.S., owned and crewed by U.S. citizens and flying the U.S. flag. The law has been waived during previous storms, but U.S. President Joe Biden has not responded to Pierluisi’s petition. Pierluisi’s letter comes as a British Petroleum ship with 300,000 barrels of diesel floats off Puerto Rico’s southern coast since Sunday, awaiting entry. The archbishop of San Juan, Roberto González Nieves, also appealed to Biden to waive the law, saying the measure makes Puerto Rico’s recovery and rebuilding difficult because it drives up prices for materials.  He also said that despite officials claiming a majority of the island’s homes have power, “this does not match with our lived experience.” “If this is not attended to immediately, we will face a deeper crisis in Puerto Rico,” he wrote in a letter to the president. A group of Puerto Rico legislators, including the president of the island’s House of Representatives, were at a White House meeting with officials to urge a temporary waiver of the law amid concerns that elderly people could start dying like they did in the sweltering aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which struck as a Category 4 storm in September 2017. “Every minute counts in an emergency,” said Puerto Rico Rep. Eddie Charbonier. Local and federal official have long called for a permanent repeal of the Jones Act, saying it has driven up prices and crippled Puerto Rico’s economy. Pierluisi asked Biden for a waiver limited to the shipment of petroleum-derived products and liquefied natural gas to at least nine specific ports around the island. “This specifically targeted and temporary relief would allow Puerto Rico to diversity its fuel sources, ease supply constraints and mitigate the risk of a fuel shortage in the middle of the response to the emergency caused by Hurricane Fiona,” he wrote. The Category 1 storm slammed into the island’s southwest region on Sept. 18, sparking an island-wide blackout. As of Tuesday, power had been restored to more than 70% of 1.47 million clients, driving up demand for diesel as businesses, government agencies and homeowners continue to rely on generators. During a press conference on Tuesday, Josué Colón executive director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, surprised many as he became emotional and wiped away tears as he spoke. “When you tell yourself, ‘We have to lift it up once again,’ you can’t stop thinking about family,’” he said, referring to the island’s power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and pummeled by Fiona. Government officials have said 77% to 91% of clients might have power by Friday, adding on Tuesday that the remaining 9% in areas hardest hit by Fiona could be connected soon. “We hope within days,” said Daniel Hernández, an engineer with Luma, the private company that took over the island’s power transmission and distribution last year. “This is not María.” However, the governor warned during the press conference that “we still have a lot to do to completely recover.”","https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-biden-storms-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-2a7bac15a1838d264c8e6de9eefd9c25

U.S. approves temporary shipping waiver for Puerto Rico after hurricane,David Shepardson,9/28/22," The Biden administration on Wednesday approved a waiver of U.S. shipping rules to address Puerto Rico’s immediate energy and other essential needs in the wake of a devastating hurricane.

Puerto Rico reaches first World Cup quarterfinals,DOUG FEINBERG,9/27/22,"Puerto Rico is headed to the quarterfinals of the women’s World Cup for the first time. Mya Hollingshed scored 29 points and Arella Guirantes added 18 to lead Puerto Rico to the 92-73 win over South Korea on Tuesday on the final day of pool play. Puerto Rico (2-3) scored the game’s first 18 points, including 10 by Hollingshed, and never looked back. The team secured the final spot in the quarterfinals that begin Thursday. “My shot was falling,” Hollingshed said. “I looked up and they hadn’t scored yet.” After the final buzzer sounded, the Puerto Rican players were dancing and celebrating their accomplishment. In other games Tuesday, the U.S. routed Bosnia and Herzegovina 121-59; China beat Belgium 81-55; Canada topped Mali 88-65; Serbia edged France 68-62. Australia defeated Japan 71-54. FIBA held a draw for the quarterfinals matchups Thursday, announcing Puerto Rico will face Canada. In other matchups, the U.S. plays Serbia; China meets France and Australia plays Belgium. The Puerto Rican players and coaches hope advancing to the quarters will provide some joy to the island that’s been ravaged by Hurricane Fiona. They won for the first time in the country’s history earlier in the tournament. “Making history now for us, with what our country is going through right now with Hurricane Fiona. It’s monumental and I hope that it brings some joy to the country and that’s all we want to do, through basketball bring some joy,” said Tayra Melendez. The team was winless in its three games at the 2018 World Cup, losing by an average of nearly 28 points. The team wasn’t even supposed to be in the tournament, but was given a spot when Russia wasn’t allowed to compete following its invasion of Ukraine. “It means a lot with everything going on on the island,” Hollingshed said. “With everything they are dealing with, we’re playing for more than ourselves. I know everyone’s excited and encouraging us.” South Korea had a scary moment when Yebin Yoon went down on the court, injured after missing a layup. After a few minutes of being looked at by team trainers, she was taken to the locker room. She didn’t return to the game. UNITED STATES 121, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 59 Kelsey Plum scored 20 points, Chelsea Gray added 16 and the United States women routed Bosnia and Herzegovina to break the team record for consecutive wins at the World Cup.  The victory was the 27th in a row in World Cup play for the Americans, who haven’t lost since the 2006 semifinals against Russia. The U.S. won 26 in a row from 1994-2006 leading up to that game. The Soviet Union holds the World Cup record with 56 straight wins from 1959-86. The Americans (5-0) won their pool games by an average of 46.2 points and never trailed in any. Nikolina Elez scored 19 points to lead the 0-5 losing side, which was playing in its first World Cup. CHINA 81, BELGIUM 55 Li Meng scored 16 points and China clinched the No. 2 seed in Group A with its win over Belgium. China (4-1) led 50-45 late in the third quarter before a 19-5 run spanning the periods broke the game open. Wang Siyu had five points during the run. Belgium never threatened after that. Kyara Linskens scored 14 points and Julie Vanloo added 13 for Belgium (3-2), which was playing without star Emma Meesseman, who injured her left calf in the previous game and is out for the rest of the tournament. CANADA 88, MALI 65 Bridget Carleton scored 27 points, hitting seven 3-pointers, to help Canada top Mali. Canada (4-1), which finished second in its pool, led 33-16 after the first quarter and didn’t look back. Mali (0-5) finished the tournament losing by an average of 30 points a game. FIBA opened an investigation into an altercation between two Mali players in the mixed zone following their loss to Serbia on Monday. The scuffle between teammates Salimatou Kourouma and Kamite Elisabeth Dabou happened while they were walking through the post-game media area and was caught on film by Serbian media. Kourouma had nine points in the game and Dabou had six. The players apologized for the incident after Tuesday’s game. SERBIA 68, FRANCE 62 Yvonne Anderson scored 18 points and Jovana Nogic added 17 to help Serbia top France. Serbia (3-2) was clinging to a two-point lead when Sasa Cado banked in a 3-pointer from the wing with 25.2 seconds left to make it a five-point game. Gabby Williams missed a 3 on France’s next possession and Tina Krajisnik made one of two free throws with 10.7 seconds left to seal the win. Alexia Charterau scored 16 to lead France (3-2). AUSTRALIA 71, JAPAN 54 Sami Whitcomb scored 15 points and Marianna Tolo added 14 as Australia clinched the top seed in its pool with the win over Japan. The game was back and forth in the first half with the Opals (4-1) holding a 36-34 lead at the break. Australia was up 45-39 with 3:42 left in the third before outscoring Japan 11-4 over the rest of the period. Australia was still without Bec Allen, who hurt her ribs in a win over Serbia. The team hopes to have her back for the next rounds. Monica Okoye scored 14 points to lead Japan (1-4), which was eliminated from the tournament. It was a disappointing finish for Japan, winners of the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics last year.  ___ More AP women’s basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","https://apnews.com/article/sports-australia-south-korea-puerto-rico-mya-hollingshed-c33c435ffacf6093eee98ae861db5cac

"Some 503,000 still without power in Puerto Rico after Fiona",Reuters,9/27/22," An estimated 503,000 homes and businesses were still without power in Puerto Rico on Tuesday after Hurricane Fiona hit on Sept. 18 and caused an islandwide power outage for its 3.3 million people. After hitting Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, Hurricane Fiona turned north and slammed into eastern Canada over the weekend where it left more than a third Nova Scotia without power.   read more  Fiona hit Puerto Rico about five years after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island. PowerOutage.us, which estimates outages based on utility data, said 503,000 customers were without service on Tuesday based on information from LUMA Energy, which operates Puerto Rico's grid. There were about 600,000 customers without power Monday afternoon out of 1.468 million total customers, according to PowerOutage.us.   read more  That pace of restoration is much faster than after Maria  when almost all 1.5 million customers had no power for a week. At that time the now bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) was still operating the grid. It took PREPA about 11 months to restore power to all customers, but Maria was a much more powerful storm than Fiona. Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph, while Fiona hit as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 mph. LUMA Energy said on Monday it restored service to nearly 877,800 customers and said expects to have 77%91% of customers restored by Friday if there is sufficient generation available from PREPA and other private generators.

US women use stellar defense to rout Puerto Rico 106-42,DOUG FEINBERG,9/23/22,"The United States is quickly identifying itself as a stellar defensive squad by using its athleticism to make it difficult for opponents to score. Shakira Austin scored 19 points, Kahleah Copper added 16 and the U.S. played suffocating defense to rout Puerto Rico 106-42 on Friday in the women’s World Cup. “We talk every day about being hard to play against, getting deflections, and the team has really bought into that,” U.S. coach Cheryl Reeve said. The Americans (2-0) forced Puerto Rico into 21 turnovers and contested nearly every shot, making every point tough to come by. “It’s fun playing on a team that loves to play defense. It really fuels our offense,” said Alyssa Thomas, who had six of the Americans’ 13 steals. The U.S. jumped out to a 27-11 lead after one quarter as Thomas had 10 points and five steals in the opening 10 minutes. The Americans forced nine turnovers in the period. The U.S. kept the pressure on in the second, holding Puerto Rico without a point for nearly the first five minutes of the period. Mya Hollingshed finally ended the drought, making a contested 3-pointer that made it 40-17. The Americans led 54-21 at the half. There was little drama in the second half as the U.S. kept extending its lead. The Americans contained guard Arella Guirantes, who had 26 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in Puerto Rico’s opening win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. She was held to seven points on 2-of-12 shooting. The U.S. threw four or five different defenders at her, starting with Copper.  “We like to be aggressive on both ends,” Breanna Stewart said. “We can and will guard multiple positions and make it hard for the other team. Our activity and awareness of one and another on the defensive end will go a long way in the tournament.” The U.S. now has won 24 consecutive World Cup games since losing in the 2006 semifinals to Russia. The Americans are two wins short of matching their record 26-game run from 1998-2006. Puerto Rico (1-1) was coming off its first-ever World Cup win. Hollingshed, who played in college at Colorado, finished with 10 points. “The U.S. is the most important team in the tournament, but for us we are just trying to win one more game,” Puerto Rico captain Pamela Rosado said.  REINFORCEMENTS Chelsea Gray and Kelsey Plum landed in Sydney after celebrating the Las Vegas Aces’ first WNBA championship with a parade on Tuesday. They sat on the U.S. bench and cheered on their teammates. A’ja Wilson, the third member of the championship team, was expected to land in Sydney later Friday. “We’ll get some time in the morning with them before we play against a really good China team tomorrow,” Reeve said. “The depth will be helpful.” SCOREBOARD In other games Friday, Serbia topped Japan 69-64; China routed Bosnia and Herzegovina 98-51; and Belgium beat South Korea 84-61. Canada faced France, and Australia played Mali later Friday night. BENCH PLAY Led by Austin, the U.S. reserves outscored Puerto Rico’s 47-21. Brionna Jones added 15 points and nine boards. RECORD WATCH As good as the U.S. defense was, it wasn’t the lowest scoring total by an American opponent. Argentina had 22 points in 1953. ... The Americans also fell short of the margin-of-victory record held by the 2014 team that beat Angola 119-44. ... Thomas also fell one short of the U.S. record for steals in a game set by Cheryl Miller in 1986. Tamika Catchings had six against Russia in 2002. Olga Gomez of Cuba holds the World Cup record of 10 against France in 1994. UP NEXT Puerto Rico: Faces Belgium on Saturday.

Post-Fiona fuel disruptions spark fear in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,9/23/22,"A growing number of businesses, including grocery stores and gas stations, are temporarily closing across Puerto Rico as power outages caused by Hurricane Fiona drag on in the U.S. territory, sparking concern about the availability of fuel and basic goods. Hand-written signs warning of closures have been popping up more frequently, eliciting sighs and groans from customers on an island where nearly 60% of 1.47 million clients still do not have power five days after the storm hit. Betty Merced, a retiree who lives in the southern coastal city of Salinas, said she has spent several days looking for diesel to fill up her generator to no avail. She uses a sleep apnea machine and cannot risk going without it. “There are a lot of people with a lot of needs,” she said. “If there is no diesel, we’re going to be very much in harm’s way.” Merced said she would travel to the nearby town of Santa Isabel on Friday, and if she doesn’t find diesel there, she will drive more than an hour to the northern city of Caguas, where at least one convenience store had a “No gas” sign on its door Thursday evening. “I didn’t think we were going to be so many days without power,” she said. Gasoline also was unavailable in Salinas after all gas stations shut down Wednesday, said community leader Wanda Ríos Colorado. “When I saw that, my stomach almost turned,” she said, adding that it gave her flashbacks of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, resulting in nearly 3,000 deaths and sparking severe shortages of fuel, food, water and cash. People also have struggled to get their prescriptions as some pharmacies temporarily close. Puerto Rico’s Department of Consumer Affairs said there is no shortage of fuel, but rather a disruption to the system as a result of flooding, landslides and an island-wide power outage caused by Fiona when it slammed into Puerto Rico’s southwestern corner Sunday as a Category 1 storm. Some fuel stations were unable to reopen or could not be refilled in the storm’s early aftermath, officials said. Consumer Affairs Secretary Edan Rivera sought to temper concerns, saying that “there is no basis to talk about a fuel shortage in Puerto Rico.” He added that his agency also has found sufficient supplies of basic goods. On Friday, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi of Puerto Rico activated the National Guard to help distribute diesel fuel to hospitals and supermarkets. The force is also supplying generators used to operate potable water plants and telecommunications towers.  On Thursday evening, Rivera announced that crews finally restored power to a gasoline distribution terminal in the southeastern town of Yabucoa that had been operating at a third of its capacity because it was running on a generator. Rivera said this would speed up distribution of fuel across the island because the terminal could now operate 24 hours a day until the island recovers from the storm. He said there is 14 days’ worth of regular gasoline, 25 for diesel and 11 for premium. “There’s a peak in demand in the most affected areas, but it has been normalizing as trucks arrive,” he said. Rivera added that some wholesalers have taken measures to prevent retailers from hoarding fuel. “Some will say they have received less product, but it’s not that they’re getting less. They asked for a lot, and to err on the side of caution, they’re not being given everything they ask for,” he said. Rivera also noted that a container ship carrying 300,000 barrels of diesel would arrive Friday and the product would be distributed starting Saturday. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico’s Water and Sewer Authority said that of the 956,000 customers out of 1.32 million who have had water service restored since Fiona, more than 400,000 clients have water thanks to generators that depend on diesel. Government officials said they expected to restore power by Friday in areas that were not severely affected by the storm, although they have not said when people living in storm-ravaged areas might have electricity. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged Thursday to help Puerto Rico recover from Fiona, saying, “We are with you, we are not going to walk away.” He recently approved an emergency disaster declaration and a major disaster declaration, which would free up more federal assistance to those affected by the hurricane. Biden also announced 100% federal funding for debris removal, search and rescue efforts, power and water restoration and shelter and food for one month. “We’ll do everything we can to meet the urgent needs you have,” he said. “And we know they’re real, and they’re significant.” ___ Associated Press journalist Maricarmen Rivera Sánchez contributed to this report.","https://apnews.com/article/storms-caribbean-power-outages-puerto-rico-9f8fe16688702f4c127bfa3ab7148901

Biden vows US won’t walk away from storm-struck Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,9/23/22,"President Joe Biden said Thursday the full force of the federal government is ready to help Puerto Rico recover from the devastation of Hurricane Fiona, while Bermuda and Canada’s Atlantic provinces prepared for a major blast from the Category 4 storm. Speaking at a briefing with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials in New York, Biden said, “We’re all in this together.” Biden noted that hundreds of FEMA and other federal officials are already on the ground in Puerto Rico, where Fiona caused an island-wide blackout. More than 60% of power customers remained without energy on Thursday, and a third of customers were without water — and local officials admitted they could not say when service would be fully restored. Biden said his message to the people of Puerto Rico who are still hurting from Hurricane Maria five years ago is: “We’re with you. We’re not going to walk away.” That seemed to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who was widely accused of an inadequate response to Maria, which left some Puerto Ricans without power for 11 months.  The hurricane was still at Category 4 force late Thursday as it was making a close pass to Bermuda, where authorities opened shelters and announced schools and offices would be closed Friday. Fiona was expected to still be a large and dangerously potent storm when it reached Canada’s Atlantic provinces, likely late Friday, as a post-tropical cyclone. “It’s going to be a storm that everyone remembers when it is all said and done,” said Bob Robichaud, warning preparedness meteorologist for the Canadian Hurricane Centre. Hundreds of people in Puerto Rico remained cut off by road four days after the hurricane ripped into the U.S. territory, and frustration was mounting for people like Nancy Galarza, who tried to signal for help from work crews she spotted in the distance. “Everyone goes over there,” she said pointing toward crews at the bottom of the mountain who were helping others also cut off by the storm. “No one comes here to see us. I am worried for all the elderly people in this community.” At least five landslides cover the narrow road to her community in the steep mountains around the northern town of Caguas. The only way to reach the settlement is to climb over thick mounds of mud, rock and debris left by Fiona, whose floodwaters shook the the foundations of nearby homes with earthquake-like force. “The rocks sounded like thunder,” recalled Vanessa Flores, a 47-year-old school janitor. “I’ve never in my life heard that. It was horrible.” At least one elderly woman who relies on oxygen was evacuated on Thursday by city officials who were working under a pelting rain to clear paths to the San Salvador community. Ramiro Figueroa, 63, said his bedridden 97-year-old bedridden father refused to leave home despite insistence from rescue crews. Their road was blocked by mud, rocks, trees and his sister’s pickup, which was washed down the hill during the storm. National Guard troops and others brought water, cereal, canned peaches and two bottles of apple juice. “That has helped me enormously,” Figueroa said as he scanned the devastated landscape, where a river had changed its course and tore up the community. At least eight of 11 communities in Caguas are completely isolated, said Luis González, municipal inspector of recovery and reconstruction. It’s one of at least six municipalities where crews have yet to reach some areas. People there often depend on help from neighbors, as they did following Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in 2017 that killed nearly 3,000 people. Miguel Veguilla said that in Maria’s aftermath he used picks and shovels to clear debris. But Fiona was different, unleashing huge landslides. “I cannot throw those rocks over my shoulder,” he said. Like hundreds of thousands in Puerto Rico, Veguilla has no water or electricity service, but said there is a natural water source nearby. Danciel Rivera, 31, arrived in rural Caguas with a church group and tried to bring a little cheer by dressing as a clown. “That’s very important in these moments,” he said, noting that people had never fully recovered from Hurricane Maria. “A lot of PTSD has reared its head these days.” His huge clown shoes squelched through the mud as he greeted people, whose faces lit up as they smiled at him. Puerto Rico’s government said some 62% of 1.47 million customers remained without power Thursday. A third of customers, or more than 400,000, did not yet have water service. “Too many homes and businesses are still without power” Biden said in New York, adding that additional utility crews were set to travel to the island to help restore power in the coming days. The executive director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Energy Authority, Josué Colón, told a news conference that areas less affected by Fiona should have electricity by Friday morning. But officials declined to say when power would be restored to the hardest-hit places and said they were working first to get energy to hospitals and other key infrastructure. Neither local nor federal government officials had provided an overall estimate of damage from the storm, which dropped up to 30 inches of rain in some areas. The U.S. center said Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) late Thursday. It was centered about 195 miles (315 kilometers) west of Bermuda, heading north-northeast at 21 mph (33 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 115 miles (185 kilometers) from the center and tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 275 miles (445 kilometers). Bermuda Premier David Burt sent a tweet urging residents to “take care of yourself and your family. Let’s all remember to check on as well as look out for your seniors, family and neighbors. Stay safe.” The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane watch extensive coastal expanses of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island. Hurricanes in Canada are somewhat rare, in part because once the storms reach colder waters, they lose their main source of energy. and become extratropical. Those cyclones still can have hurricane-strength winds, but now have a cold instead of a warm core and no visible eye. Their shape can be different too. They lose their symmetric form and can more resemble a comma.  Fiona so far has been blamed for at least five deaths — two in Puerto Rico, two in the Dominican Republic and one in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe. Fiona also hit the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday, but officials there reported relatively light damage and no deaths. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington, Seth Borenstein in New York, Rob Gillies in Toronto and Maricarmen Rivera Sánchez in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.","https://apnews.com/article/floods-storms-hurricanes-bermuda-puerto-rico-a9d3d02464f300024e3b77a40cc8e05d

Puerto Rico players hope win brings joy to recovering island,DOUG FEINBERG,9/23/22,"Puerto Rico captain Pamela Rosado hopes the team’s first victory in the women’s World Cup can provide a small bit of joy to the island that’s been ravaged by Hurricane Fiona. The island’s government said some 62% of 1.47 million customers remained without power Thursday, a few days after it was devastated by Fiona. A third of customers, or more than 400,000, did not yet have water service. “The win yesterday was everything for us, for Puerto Rico. This game is everything for the island,” Rosado said of the team’s 82-58 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Thursday. “My family is OK, they have no water, no power, but they keep going. They were so appreciative of the win to get a little joy and pride.” The destruction from Fiona was made more devastating because Puerto Rico has yet to recover from Hurricane Maria, which destroyed the power grid in 2017. Five years later, more than 3,000 homes on the island are still covered by blue tarps. “It’s super big. We are fortunate enough to be over here with what’s going on over there,” Puerto Rico guard Jen O’Neill said. “A lot of us have family members that are having to deal with that.” The team was winless in its three games at the 2018 World Cup, which came a year after Maria hit. But now Puerto Rico has a chance to advance to the quarterfinals if it can win one of its next three games. “We are taking it one game at a time, but know that the game against Korea will be big,” Rosado said. Puerto Rico wasn’t even supposed to be in the tournament, but was given a spot when Russia wasn’t allowed to compete following its invasion of Ukraine. “We want to take advantage of this opportunity and showcase that we’re growing,” O’Neill said. “We are a small island surrounded by water and get hit by everything.” Puerto Rico struggled, as expected, against the U.S., falling 106-42 on Friday. T he plight of the island left an impression on American Breanna Stewart. “To see Puerto Rico get the win yesterday, they are obviously playing with a sense of pride, continuing to represent their country in all the ways possible,” Stewart said. “A lot of times in the world we are going through unfortunate situations and Puerto Rico is going through that right now, but I think they are turning the sadness into strength.” ___ More AP women’s basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-australia-puerto-rico-eab725deffcf8fb9df0435d25df340a4

"In beleaguered Puerto Rico, Fiona revives trauma of Hurricane Maria",Ivelisse Rivera,9/23/22," Javier RiveraAquino is a lawyer who supplemented his income by raising bananas on a 17acre plot of land in the mountains of westcentral Puerto Rico until five years ago, when Hurricane Maria plowed into the island and swept away his plantation. For RiveraAquino, this week revived painful memories of 2017 as another powerful storm, Fiona, inflicted a fresh round of destruction on an island still struggling to recover from Maria. Strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall on Sunday, Fiona hit the island with surprising fury, destroying crops, dumping massive amounts of rain and cutting power to nearly every corner of the island. Days later, with more than 900,000 homes and businesses still without electricity, Puerto Ricans are coming to grips with the extent of the damage. RiveraAquino said farmers near his hometown of Lares are digging out after the storm stripped coffee fruit from trees planted on mountainsides and washed out banana plantations in the valleys. ""The farmers in the valley, the banana farmers, total devastation,"" said RiveraAquino, 50. ""They're hit bad and I'm not sure what they'll do."" RiveraAquino knows too well the challenges now facing his neighbors around Lares, about 62 miles (100 km) southwest of San Juan, the capital city. ""I farmed with pride,"" he said. ""It was something I did with pride, but the insurance wasn't enough to replant, so I had to sell. Maria took it from me."" While LUMA Energy, the grid operator, said “full restoration could take several days,"" RiveraAquino is skeptical that timetable can be met. ""Maybe it'll be weeks, maybe longer in the mountains,"" said RiveraAquino, who feels fortunate to have installed solar panels on his home and a large cistern to catch rainwater to supply his family. 'IT'S INCREDIBLE' Jonathan Berrios, a writer who lives in the small city of Cidra, said Fiona brought a deluge of about 30 inches of rain as the storm battered the island for hours with wind gusts at times up to 90 mph. ""The rain, it's a record for this place, more than Maria,"" Berrios said. While Cidra, about 31 miles (50 km) south of the capital, suffered multiple landslides in the wake of the catastrophic 2017 hurricane, Fiona has brought its own significant problems, he said. Some roads are blocked with mud and stones, several bridges were washed away and houses near the rivers were flooded to their rooftops, or knocked off their foundations, he said. ""The rain and river took them down,"" Berrios said. His house is built on a hill, and while some water got in, he said it wasn't damaged much. ""We're in the center of the island. Salinas and places in the south are the worst. I'd say thousands of homes are damaged or destroyed. It's incredible. Some houses are buried in mud...Crazy."" Juan Mercado, a major and division commander for the Salvation Army in San Juan, said the church has distributed more than 10,000 meals since Monday, usually chicken or beef, some rice or pasta and salad greens. His team has about 80 volunteers on the ground, but expects the ranks to swell in the next few days to 125. The aim is to serve meals for at least the next two weeks. Mercado toured the damaged parts of the island for two days this week.

Hurricane Fiona extends Puerto Rico's energy problems beyond power grid,Ivelisse Rivera,9/23/22," Puerto Rico's widespread power outages caused by Hurricane Fiona have led to cascading energy problems for the island, where fuel distribution limitations and surging demand for fuel to run backup generators has left many gas stations dry. An estimated 926,500 homes and businesses were without power in Puerto Rico on Friday morning, five days after Hurricane Fiona knocked out electricity to most of the island. Residents have formed kilometerlong lines outside of gas stations, hoping to obtain diesel to power home backup generators, according to a Reuters witness. ""Those of us who live in the mountains are used to having our water and electricity go out every day,"" said Shamir Martinez, who lives in a rural area of the San Juan suburb of Bayamon. ""Now, the whole country knows what we go through and nobody does anything."" Fiona hit Puerto Rico on Sunday, five years after Hurricane Maria  knocked out all power  on the island. Estimates by PowerOutage.us said 926,500 customers, out of 1.47 million total, were without service on Friday. The figures are based on information from Puerto Rico's grid operator LUMA Energy. LUMA, a joint venture owned by units of Canadian energy firm ATCO Ltd and U.S. energy contractor Quanta Services Inc  (PWR.N) , said ""full restoration could take several days."" The pace of restoration since Fiona has been much faster than after Maria, where only 20% of customers had power even a month after the storm. At that time, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) was operating the grid. It took PREPA about 11 months to restore power to all customers. Still, Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in 2017 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph, while Fiona hit as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 mph. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far attributed four deaths to Fiona in Puerto Rico. The official death toll for Maria was about 3,000. PREPA still owns much of Puerto Rico's power infrastructure, but LUMA won a contract to operate the grid in 2020 and started managing that system in 2021. About $12 billion in federal funds, including $9.5 billion approved by FEMA, have been dedicated to strengthening Puerto Rico's electrical grid since Maria. Analysts say most of the electrical system work has involved restoring transmissions lines. Disagreements over how the federal money is spent, along with bureaucratic setbacks and the privatization of grid operations, have stalled progress on modernizing the system. Some supermarkets had reduced hours due to lack of electricity or diesel for generators, raising concerns about the possibility of food shortages, local media reported. Martinez, whose broken neighborhood roads still show the scars of Maria, said she and her neighbors' practice with outages have taught them how to survive. If markets close, they can eat avocados, breadfruit and bananas from wild fruit trees, and there is a local ""puddle"" to cool off with. ""One day at a time,"" she said. Puerto Rico is restoring power to homes more quickly in the wake of Hurricane Fiona than after Hurricane Maria five years ago, when it took months before the island fully recovered.

Medical device makers see little impact from Fiona on Puerto Rico operations,Leroy Leo,9/23/22," Medical device companies and some drugmakers with manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico said they do not expect meaningful disruption from Hurricane Fiona, which knocked out power for over 3 million people and caused flooding and landslides on the island. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which worked with companies to prevent shortages of drugs and medical devices after Hurricane Maria battered the medical manufacturing hub in 2017, said it is in discussion with companies it regulates there regarding any impact on supplies. Most companies Reuters spoke to, including Baxter International  (BAX.N) , said they had initially either temporarily halted operations or were running their plants on generators since Fiona struck on Sunday. None said they expected supplies to the United States to be significantly disrupted by the storm, in part due to infrastructure changes, such as building up their generator power, following Hurricane Maria. The  electricity grid  on the island is owned by bankrupt staterun Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and is now operated by LUMA Energy, a private joint venture of Canadian energy firm ATCO Ltd and U.S. energy contractor Quanta Services  (PWR.N) . While the pace of power restoration has been much faster than following the devastation of Maria, an estimated 1 million homes and businesses  remain without power .
Baxter, which makes small bags for intravenous medication, clinical nutrition products and inhaled anesthetics in Puerto Rico, said its facilities have ""sustained little to no damage"" from the storm. By Thursday, Baxter had restarted operations and was running at normal, prehurricane levels, spokesperson Lauren Russ said. The company took a $70 million revenue hit after Hurricane Maria in 2017, spurring it to diversify manufacturing of key products. Ahead of hurricane season, the company now builds up supplies of some products and stores much of it on the U.S. mainland, Russ said, adding that Baxter had good inventory levels for most products produced in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic for U.S. customers. Integra Lifesciences  (IART.O)  and Abbott Laboratories also upgraded backup generators and communication capabilities and shored up infrastructure at plants such as improvements to roofs and pipes, their spokespeople said. ""Most MedTech companies are more prepared with greater redundancy"" than when Maria hit, J.P Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus in a research note. Spokespeople for other medical equipment companies including Becton Dickinson  (BDX.N) , Medtronic  (MDT.N) , Edwards Lifesciences  (EW.N)  and Stryker  (SYK.N)  also said they were not seeing a major impact to operations from Hurricane Fiona due to measures undertaken following Maria. Drugmakers with plants in Puerto Rico said they have been able to keep up production and supplies as well. Johnson & Johnson  (JNJ.N)  said operations were restored at all its sites in Puerto Rico by Wednesday. AbbVie's  (ABBV.N)  facilities are intact and operational and unlikely to see any patient impact or product shortages due to Fiona, according to a person familiar with the company's operations who asked not to be named. Eli Lilly and Co has not experienced any disruptions to its site or supply, spokesperson Molly McCully said.

"Hurricane Fiona heads to Bermuda, up to 8 dead in Puerto Rico",Ivelisse Rivera,9/23/22," Hurricane Fiona strengthened to a powerful Category 4 storm on Wednesday as it headed toward Bermuda after carving a destructive path through the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where the storm left most people without power and up to eight dead. After making landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday, Fiona caused devastating flooding and landslides on the island. Over the next two days, the storm gathered steam as it barreled into the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Fiona packed winds as high as 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour) on Wednesday and was expected to strengthen as it moved north toward Bermuda, though no direct hit is forecast for the British territory, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Fiona could reach Canada's Atlantic coast on Friday. Eric Blake, acting branch chief for the NHC in Miami, said Bermuda would see high surf, storm surges, heavy rainfall and powerful winds even if Fiona kept on its current path and passed to the west of the island. Bermuda will see the worst of the storm by late Thursday, the NHC said. ""Hopefully, the core of the storm will stay west, but it could still jog east and hit Bermuda,"" Blake said, adding that the U.S. East Coast would experience large swells and rip currents as the storm churns toward Canada. ""This will be a big deal up there,"" he told Reuters, referring to Fiona's track toward Canada's Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Puerto Rico, where 40% of the island's 3.3 million residents were still without water and threefourths were lacking power, authorities were trying to determine the scale of the destruction and start rebuilding. U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a disaster declaration for Puerto Rico, which makes federal funding available for individuals affected by the storm, the White House said in a statement. Fiona might have caused at least eight deaths, including that of a sick 4monthold infant whose mother struggled to get to the hospital due to blocked roads, Dr. Maria Conte Miller, director of the Institute of Forensic Sciences, said in at roundtable on Tuesday. The deaths are under investigation. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far attributed four deaths to the storm in Puerto Rico. A fifth person was killed in Guadeloupe earlier in the week. For many Puerto Rico residents, the memory of Hurricane Maria in 2017 is still fresh. Some 3,000 people died in that Category 5 storm, which left the entire island without electricity for a week.   read more  Marylou Maldonado, 45, a saleswoman from the town of Camuy in northwestern Puerto Rico, said water was restored to her residence on Tuesday, but that the governor and energy provider failed to fulfill their promise to restore power to her region. ""People are under a lot of stress,"" she said. ""Here in this area, the crisis is emotional. It is emotional because of the frustration of not having electricity and that we are being lied to."" An estimated 1.07 million homes and businesses remained without power in Puerto Rico by midday on Wednesday, according to LUMA Energy, which has said full restoration to all 1.5 million customers could take several days.   read more  The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a tropical storm warning for the British territory, 600 miles (966 km) east of the U.S. state of North Carolina. Hurricaneforce winds are a possibility depending on the storm's path, it said. Michelle Pitcher, deputy director of the service, said the country is ""like a point sticking up out of the ocean"" that had no protective shores, meaning severe flooding was more of a danger. Even so, Pitcher said, Bermuda is ready for what Fiona has in store for the island. ""Bermuda residents are very well practiced in preparing for storms,"" she said. ""We build strong houses.""

"Bermuda hunkers down as Hurricane Fiona looms, powerless Puerto Rico swelters",Don Burgess,9/22/22," Bermudians boarded up windows and stocked up on groceries and flashlight batteries as Hurricane Fiona drew nearer on Thursday after causing several deaths and leaving many people sweltering without power in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Scott Barnes, who fishes for mahimahi and tuna, was adding three or four anchors to a boat moored near the shore, and planned to move his two other boats to a protective cove to shelter them from the worst of the Category 4 storm. ""I'm taking this one serious,"" he said. As of Thursday afternoon, Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 miles (215 km) per hour and was about 345 miles (555 km) westsouthwest of Bermuda and moving northnortheast at 16 mph (26 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. A hurricane warning remained in effect for all of Bermuda, home to more than 60,000 people, and the eye of the storm is expected to pass just west of Bermuda on Thursday night, the center said. ""It could still jog east and hit Bermuda,"" said Eric Blake, acting branch chief for the hurricane center in Miami. Even on its current path, hurricaneforce winds could hit the island at 70 mph (110 kph) Thursday night and up to four inches (10.16 cm) of rain are expected. Across the island, people cleared loose debris from yards and readied to close storm shutters: Many homes are built with small shuttered windows, slate roofs and limestone blocks to withstand frequent hurricanes. ""I'm taking every precaution to stay safe,"" said Dean Williams, a resident of the capital city of Hamilton. ""Preparation is the key because at its highest intensity we can do nothing but wait it out."" At least eight deaths have been attributed to Fiona, including that of a sick 4monthold infant whose mother struggled to get to the hospital due to blocked roads.

"Fiona swipes Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico faces big cleanup",DÁNICA COTO,9/21/22,"Hurricane Fiona blasted the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday as a Category 3 storm after devastating Puerto Rico, where most people remained without electricity or running water and rescuers used heavy equipment to lift survivors to safety. The storm’s eye passed close to Grand Turk, the small British territory’s capital island, on Tuesday morning after the government imposed a curfew and urged people to flee flood-prone areas. Storm surge could raise water levels there by as much as 5 to 8 feet above normal, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. While the storm was still lashing the archipelago late Tuesday, officials reported only a handful of downed trees and electric posts and no deaths. However, they noted that telecommunications on Grand Turk were severely affected. “Fiona definitely has battled us over the last few hours, and we’re not out of the thick of it yet,” said Akierra Missick, minister of physical planning and infrastructure development. Late Tuesday night, the storm was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of North Caicos Island, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the center. Premier Washington Misick had urged people to evacuate. “Storms are unpredictable,” he said in a statement from London, where he had attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph) and was moving north-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph), according to the Hurricane Center, which said the storm was likely to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane as it approaches Bermuda on Friday. Rain was still lashing parts of Puerto Rico Tuesday, where the sounds of people scraping, sweeping and spraying their homes and streets echoed across rural areas as historic floodwaters began to recede. In the central mountain town of Cayey, where the Plato River burst its banks and the brown torrent of water consumed cars and homes, overturned dressers, beds and large refrigerators lay strewn in people’s yards Tuesday. “Puerto Rico is not prepared for this, or for anything,” said Mariangy Hernández, a 48-year-old housewife, who said she doubted the government would help her community of some 300 in the long term, despite ongoing efforts to clear the streets and restore power. “This is only for a couple of days and later they forget about us.” She and her husband were stuck in line waiting for the National Guard to clear a landslide in their hilly neighborhood. “Is it open? Is it open?” one driver asked, worried that the road might have been completely closed. Other drivers asked the National Guard if they could swing by their homes to help cut trees or clear clumps of mud and debris. The cleanup efforts occurred on the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in 2017 and knocked out power for a year in parts of Cayey. Jeannette Soto, a 34-year-old manicurist, worried it would take a long time for crews to restore power because a landslide swept away the neighborhood’s main light post. “It’s the first time this happens,” she said of the landslides. “We didn’t think the magnitude of the rain was going to be so great.” Gov. Pedro Pierluisi requested a major disaster declaration on Tuesday and said it would be at least a week before authorities have an estimate of the damage that Fiona caused.  He said the damage caused by the rain was “catastrophic,” especially in the island’s central, south and southeast regions. “The impact caused by the hurricane has been devastating for many people,” he said. The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency traveled to Puerto Rico on Tuesday as the agency announced it was sending hundreds of additional personnel to boost local response efforts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency on the island and deployed a couple of teams to the U.S. territory. The broad storm kept dropping copious rain over the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where a 58-year-old man died after police said he was swept away by a river in the central mountain town of Comerio. Another death was linked to a power blackout — a 70-year-old man was burned to death after he tried to fill his generator with gasoline while it was running, officials said. Parts of the island had received more than 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain and more was falling Tuesday. National Guard Brig. Gen. Narciso Cruz described the flooding as historic. “There were communities that flooded in the storm that didn’t flood under Maria,” he said, referring to the 2017 hurricane that caused nearly 3,000 deaths. “I’ve never seen anything like this.” Cruz said 670 people have been rescued in Puerto Rico, including 19 people at a retirement home in Cayey that was in danger of collapsing. “The rivers broke their banks and blanketed communities,” he said. Some people were rescued via kayaks and boats while others nestled into the massive shovel of a digger and were lifted to higher ground. He lamented that some people initially refused to leave their homes, adding that he understood why. “It’s human nature,” he said. “But when they saw their lives were in danger, they agreed to leave.” The blow from Fiona was made more devastating because Puerto Rico has yet to recover from Hurricane Maria, which destroyed the power grid in 2017. Five years later, more than 3,000 homes on the island are still covered by blue tarps. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday he would push for the federal government to cover 100% of disaster response costs — instead of the usual 75% — as part of an emergency disaster declaration. “We need to make sure this time, Puerto Rico has absolutely everything it needs, as soon as possible, for as long as they need it,” he said. Authorities said Tuesday that at least 1,220 people and more than 70 pets remained in shelters across the island. Fiona triggered a blackout when it hit Puerto Rico’s southwest corner on Sunday, the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a Category 3 storm. By Tuesday morning, authorities said they had restored power to nearly 300,000 of the island’s 1.47 million customers. Puerto Rico’s governor warned it could take days before everyone has electricity. Water service was cut to more than 760,000 customers — two thirds of the total on the island — because of turbid water at filtration plants or lack of power, officials said. Fiona was forecast to weaken before running into easternmost Canada over the weekend. It was not expected to threaten the U.S. mainland. In the Dominican Republic, authorities reported two deaths: a 68-year-old man hit by a falling tree and an 18-year-old girl who was struck by a falling electrical post while riding a motorcycle. The storm forced more than 1,550 people to seek safety in government shelters and left more than 406,500 homes without power. The hurricane left several highways blocked, and a tourist pier in the town of Miches was badly damaged by high waves. At least four international airports were closed, officials said. The Dominican president, Luis Abinader, said authorities would need several days to assess the storm’s effects. Fiona previously battered the eastern Caribbean, killing one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe when floodwaters washed his home away, officials said. ___ Associated Press reporters Martín Adames in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and Maricarmen Rivera Sánchez in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed.","https://apnews.com/article/storms-entertainment-hurricanes-royalty-dominican-republic-73e1cfe498d50a4e85fb8de51723ee46

Puerto Rico power grid no match for Fiona; residents unsurprised,Ivelisse Rivera,9/21/22," Some 80% of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico still lacked power on Tuesday as rains from Hurricane Fiona receded, leaving residents complaining that the island's troubled electrical grid was still a mess before the storm, despite billions of dollars in funding to improve it. Power provider LUMA Energy said it had restored service to more than 100,000 customers and crews were still working to bring back power for others. Fiona hit Puerto Rico on Sunday, causing an islandwide outage for its 1.5 million customers. The company said ""full restoration could take several days."" Puerto Rico's grid has long been criticized as unreliable, but residents have complained that outages have become more frequent since LUMA took over operations last year. Residents interviewed were not surprised that the grid was vulnerable to a storm less severe than 2017's Hurricane Maria, when it took more than 11 months to fully restore power The grid is largely owned by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). The storm did more damage to transmission lines than power plants, analysts said, and restoration will depend on getting those lines back up and running. ""We had a horrible experience in the aftermath of Maria,"" said Ramon Luis Nieves, an attorney in San Juan, who was without power in his condo. ""They promised it would be better. It hasn't."" In July, protesters marched in San Juan, demanding changes after multiple rate increases and ongoing power outages.   read more  LUMA, a joint venture between units of Canadian energy firm ATCO Ltd (50%) and U.S. energy contractor Quanta Services Inc  (PWR.N)  (50%), took over operations of the island's electrical grid last year. In testimony dated Sept. 12, LUMA officials told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that in the 15 months since the company took over Puerto Rico's grid, the company has reduced outages for the average customer to 7.6 in a year from 10.6 when PREPA ran the system. LUMA also said it has restored 43 miles (69 km) of transmission lines and reenergized five substations that had been out since Hurricane Maria. ""With the change from PREPA to LUMA, the most I have seen is that the frequency of time I am without electricity is greater,"" said Mario Alegre, a film contractor based in San Juan, who said he was forced to purchase a backup battery to power his computer and other essential work equipment in case of outages. Federal Emergency Management Administration figures show that about $20 billion of the $65 billion allocated to Puerto Rico after Maria have been spent, said Adam Jordan, analyst at energy researcher Enverus. ""In the wake of Maria, blackouts and power outages became common for much of the island. This left Puerto Rico extremely vulnerable to storms far weaker than Maria,"" he said. Alegre said it was difficult to report outages and receive communication about service restorations from LUMA. A study from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found that service restoration times and voltage fluctuations increased after privatization largely due to a shortage of experienced workers.   read more  Poweroutages.com, which estimates power outages based on data from utilities, said early on Tuesday afternoon that 1.168 million customers were still without service, citing what it said was limited information available from LUMA.

"Hurricane Fiona slams Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico; three dead",Ivelisse Rivera,9/20/22," Hurricane Fiona was churning north on Monday night after bringing torrential rain and powerful winds to the Dominican Republic and a total power outage in neighboring Puerto Rico, killing at least three. The first hurricane to score a direct hit on the Dominican Republic since Jeanne left severe damage in September 2004, Fiona caused severe floods, cutting off villages, forcing about 12,500 from their homes and leaving 709,000 without power. ""The damage is considerable,"" said President Luis Abinader, who plans to declare a state of disaster in the provinces of La Altagracia, home to the famed resort of Punta Cana, El Seibo and Hato Mayor. One man was killed in a treefall in the coastal town of Matancitas north of capital Santo Domingo, emergency operations official Juan Manuel Mendez told reporters. The Category 2 hurricane, packing maximum wind speeds of 110 mph (177 kph), was about 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Grand Turk Island, the Miamibased National Hurricane Center (NHC) said, and is expected to strengthen to Category 3 as it heads across warm Caribbean waters to the Turks and Caicos. On Tuesday, the center of Fiona is expected to pass near the archipelago, where a hurricane warning has been declared, the NHC said, with tropical storm conditions also expected in the Bahamas. After strafing Puerto Rico, Fiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic near Boca Yuma early on Monday, with its center reaching the northern coast of Hispaniola before noon. In La Altagracia, in the extreme east, the overflow of the Yuma River damaged farms and left several towns isolated. Electric and water utilities are working to restore services in affected areas. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, is still being lashed by strong winds, frequent lightning and heavy rain after Fiona made landfall there on Sunday afternoon, dumping up to 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain in some areas. The storm comes five years after Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria, which triggered the worst power blackout in U.S. history. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi on Monday, promising to add more support personnel sent to the island over the next few days. ""The president said that he will ensure the federal team remains on the job to get it done,"" the White House said in a statement. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell will travel there on Tuesday. Jeannette Rivera, 54, a public relations worker in Orlando, Florida, said she had not spoken with her family since a spotty phone call early Sunday. She fears for her parents' safety and the health of her 84yearold father, who had just contracted COVID19 and was running a fever. ""My worry is that if they need help, there's no way to communicate,"" Rivera said. WITHOUT POWER Nearly 90% of Puerto Rico remained without power on Monday, according to Poweroutage.us. Officials said it would take days to restore power to all the island's 3.3 million people. Downed trees and mudslides blocked many roads. Social media images showed submerged cars, people wading in waistdeep water and rescue boats floating down swamped streets. Just 30% of drinking water customers have service. Crews rescued about 400 people from flooding in the southern town of Salinas, where rain slowed to a drizzle. The south and southeast regions were the hardest hit. Puerto Rico's power grid remains fragile despite emergency repairs after Maria, says Center for a New Economy, a Puerto Rican think tank. Thousands of Puerto Ricans still live under makeshift tarpaulin roofs in the wake of Maria, a category 5 storm in 2017 that killed more than 3,000 people, left 1.5 million customers without electricity and knocked out 80% of power lines. A 70yearold man in the northern town of Arecibo was Puerto Rico's firstknown casualty, killed instantly by the explosion of his electric generator as he tried to start it, police said. A second man drowned, while police said an 88yearold woman died of a heart attack. Hundreds of responders joined recovery efforts after Biden declared an emergency, allowing FEMA to coordinate disaster relief for the island. For most of the five years since Maria, the debtladen government and power utility were mired in bankruptcy, with Puerto Rico's finances managed by a federally appointed oversight board.

Hurricane Fiona rips through powerless Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,9/19/22,"Hurricane Fiona struck Puerto Rico’s southwest coast on Sunday as it unleashed landslides, knocked the power grid out and ripped up asphalt from roads and flung the pieces around. Hundreds of people were evacuated or rescued across the island as floodwaters rose swiftly. Rushing rivers of brown water enveloped cars, first floors and even an airport runway in the island’s southern region. Forecasters said the storm threatened to dump “historic” levels of rain on Sunday and Monday, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in eastern and southern Puerto Rico. “The damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. The storm washed away a bridge in the central mountain town of Utuado that police say was installed by the National Guard after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017. Large landslides also were reported, with water rushing down big slabs of broken asphalt and into gullies.  Fiona was centered 45 miles (75 kilometers) south-southeast of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) on Sunday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It was moving to the west-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph). Fiona struck on the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which hit Puerto Rico 33 years ago as a Category 3 storm. The storm’s clouds covered the entire island and tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 140 miles (220 kilometers) from Fiona’s center. U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in the U.S. territory as the eye of the storm approached the island’s southwest corner. Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution, said bad weather, including winds of 80 mph, had disrupted transmission lines, leading to “a blackout on all the island.” “Current weather conditions are extremely dangerous and are hindering our capacity to evaluate the complete situation,” it said, adding that it could take several days to fully restore power. Health centers were running on generators — and some of those had failed. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said crews rushed to repair generators at the Comprehensive Cancer Center, where several patients had to be evacuated. Fiona hit just two days before the anniversary of Hurricane Maria, a devastating Category 4 storm that struck on Sept. 20, 2017, destroying the island’s power grid and causing nearly 3,000 deaths. More than 3,000 homes still have only a blue tarp as a roof, and infrastructure remains weak, including the power grid. Outages remain common, and reconstruction started only recently. “I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” said Danny Hernández, who works in the capital of San Juan but planned to weather the storm with his parents and family in the western town of Mayaguez. He said the atmosphere was gloomy at the supermarket as he and others stocked up before the storm hit. “After Maria, we all experienced scarcity to some extent,” he said. The storm was forecast to pummel cities and towns along Puerto Rico’s southern coast that have not yet fully recovered from a string of strong earthquakes starting in late 2019. More than 1,000 people with some 80 pets had sought shelter across the island by Sunday night, the majority of them in the southern coast. Ada Vivian Román, a 21-year-old photography student, said the storm knocked down trees and fences in her hometown of Toa Alta. “I’m actually very anxious because it’s a really slow-moving hurricane and time does not move,” she said. “You look at the clock and it’s still the same hour.” She said she is also worried about whether the public transportation she relies on to get to her job at a public relations agency will be operating by the time she has to go back to the office. “But I know that I’m privileged compared with other families who are practically losing their homes because they are under water,” she said. In the southwest town of El Combate, hotel co-owner Tomás Rivera said he was prepared but worried about the “enormous” amount of rain he expected. He noted that a nearby wildlife refuge was eerily quiet before the storm hit. “There are thousands of birds here, and they are nowhere to be seen,” he said. “Even the birds have realized what is coming, and they’re preparing.” Rivera said his employees brought bedridden family members to the hotel, where he has stocked up on diesel, gasoline, food, water and ice, given how slowly the government responded after Hurricane Maria. “What we’ve done is prepared ourselves to depend as little as possible on the central government,” he said. Puerto Rico’s governor, Pierluisi, activated the National Guard as the Atlantic hurricane season’s sixth named storm approached. “What worries me most is the rain,” said forecaster Ernesto Morales with the National Weather Service in San Juan. Fiona was predicted to drop 12 to 16 inches (30 to 41 centimeters) of rain over eastern and southern Puerto Rico, with as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) in isolated spots. Morales noted that Hurricane Maria in 2017 had unleashed 40 inches (102 centimeters). Fiona was forecast to swipe the Dominican Republic on Monday and then northern Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands with the threat of heavy rain. It could threaten the far southern end of the Bahamas on Tuesday. A hurricane warning was posted for the Dominican Republic’s eastern coast from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo. Fiona previously battered the eastern Caribbean, killing one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe when floods washed his home away, officials said. The storm also damaged roads, uprooted trees and destroyed at least one bridge. St. Kitts and Nevis also reported flooding and downed trees, but announced its international airport would reopen on Sunday afternoon.  In the eastern Pacific, Tropical Storm Madeline was forecast to cause heavy rains and flooding across parts of southwestern Mexico. The storm was centered about 160 miles (260 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo Corrientes on Sunday night, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph).","https://apnews.com/article/floods-storms-hurricanes-puerto-rico-tropical-01028dac6655ddb5b321f345cf9e9358

Explainer: What has happened to Puerto Rico's power grid since Hurricane Maria?,Laila Kearney,9/19/22," Hurricane Fiona knocked out electrical power to the entire commonwealth of Puerto Rico starting on Sunday, reviving memories of Hurricane Maria, the deadly Category 4 storm that struck in 2017 and exposed the feeble nature of the island's electrical grid. Now, nearly all of Puerto Rico's roughly 3 million residents are in the dark again, and five years after Maria, it is raising renewed questions about the state of the grid. WHO RUNS PUERTO RICO'S POWER GRID? The staterun Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) owned and operated the island's power network when Maria hit. PREPA had been long criticized for inadequate investment in its power system and failure to establish backups to maintain power during disasters. Before Maria struck, the debtladen government and PREPA had been mired in bankruptcy, and a federally appointed oversight board was created to manage the island's finances. In June 2021, Puerto Rico privatized the grid by engaging LUMA Energy to operate the system, even though PREPA still owned the infrastructure. LUMA is a joint venture between units of Canadian energy firm ATCO Ltd and U.S. energy contractor Quanta Services  (PWR.N) . A study from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found that service restoration times and voltage fluctuations increased after privatization largely due to a shortage of experienced workers. The island also endured a power outage in April that knocked out electricity for a third of homes and businesses.   read more  LUMA did not immediately respond to request for comment. WHY IS THE GRID STILL STRUGGLING? Hurricane Maria decimated the island's electrical system when it struck in late September 2017, mainly by knocking out transmission lines. Since then, restoration work has been focused on replacing those lines, while most other facets of the grid have not been updated, said Tom Sanzillo of IEEFA, who researches Puerto Rico's power system. It took several years under the Trump Administration for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to approve $9.6 billion in September 2020 to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid. About another $3.4 billion in federal funding has been added since. Analysts say bureaucratic holdups, policy disagreements and grid privatization issues have slowed progress. Disputes over how to spend funds have also stymied improvements.   read more  ""Many enterprises, both for profits and NGOs, want a slice of the $12 billion in federal money for rebuilding the grid,"" said Sergio Marxuach, policy director of Puerto Ricobased think tank, Center for a New Economy (CNE). WHERE DOES PUERTO RICO'S POWER GENERATION COME FROM? Natural gas power plants account for 44% of electricity, while 37% comes from petroleum like diesel fuel, 17% is from coal and about 3% from renewable energy, U.S. Energy Information Administration data shows. Under the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, passed in 2019, the commonwealth is required to get 40% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, 60% by 2040 and 100% by 2050, according to the EIA. However, the grid's modernization has also been delayed by policy disagreements over using renewables versus adding more natural gas, Marxuach said. Puerto Rico has to import all its oil, coal and natural gas as it does not produce any fossil fuels. It does have solar and wind generation that has contributed to renewables generation. Coalfired generation is planned for phaseout by 2028. In early 2020, two of the island's largest power plants were damaged in a 6.4 magnitude earthquake. Those plants relied more on natural gas, causing Puerto Rico to shift its power mix to more petroleum, according to the EIA.

"Hurricane Fiona swamps Puerto Rico, knocking out power to island",Ivelisse Rivera,9/19/22," Hurricane Fiona left most of Puerto Rico without power on Sunday, causing catastrophic flooding and landslides on the island before barreling toward the Dominican Republic, a government agency said. The storm, hitting Puerto Rico five years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, ripped up asphalt from roads, swept away a major road bridge, closed airports, swamped cars and dumped rain in such quantities that some rivers were rising 20 feet in just hours, according to eyewitnesses. ""This has been catastrophic,"" Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi said at a news conference in the capital San Juan. Carmen Yulín Cruz, the former mayor of San Juan, said on Twitter that many believed the rainfall was worse than Hurricane Maria in 2017. The center of the storm made landfall on the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico near Punta Tocon at 3:20 p.m. ET (1920 GMT) with maximum sustained winds of about 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour, clearing the threshold for a Category 1 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said. Power had begun to be restored to some areas by Sunday night, officials said, but reconnecting the whole island would take days. Electricity had been out completely across the island of 3.3 million people, said LUMA Energy, operator of the island's grid, and the Puerto Rico power authority. Puerto Rico's grid remains fragile after Hurricane Maria in September 2017 caused the largest blackout in U.S. history. In that Category 5 storm, which killed more than 3,000 people, 1.5 million customers lost electricity with 80% of power lines knocked out. Thousands of Puerto Ricans still live under makeshift tarpaulin roofs. At a news conference in the capital San Juan on Sunday night, LUMA spokesperson Abner Gomez said the entire electrical system had been shut down to protect its infrastructure. Some power was being restored, with priority given to hospitals and other critical community services, he said. Several landslides had been reported, officials said. Roads were closed and a highway bridge in Utuado, a town in the center of the island, had been washed away by a flooding river. Puerto Rico's ports were closed and flights out of the main airport canceled. Torrential rains and mudslides were also forecast for the Dominican Republic as the storm progresses northwestward, with the Turks and Caicos Islands likely facing tropical storm conditions on Tuesday, the NHC said. By Sunday night, aid agencies in the Dominican Republic began evacuating residents from highrisk areas in the east of the country. President Luis Abinader, the Dominican leader, postponed a trip to New York to participate in the United Nations General Assembly, while the start of the Dominican school year was pushed back to Wednesday from Monday. U.S. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico on Sunday, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide emergency protective measures.   read more  U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said agency officials deployed to Puerto Rico would assist with restoration efforts ""as it becomes safe to do so."" Denise Rios, who lives in the southwestern town of Hormigueros, said she was left without power following strong gusts of wind and rain that began around noon on Sunday. ""Since then it hasn't stopped,"" she said. ""It is raining heavily and the wind is blowing hard. I'm calm, but alert."" A wide swathe of Puerto Rico was forecast to get 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) of rain, while parts could be hit by up to 25 inches (63.5 cm), according to the NHC. Authorities opened more than 100 shelters and closed beaches and casinos. One death tied to Fiona has been reported so far, in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. Authorities said a man was found dead on Saturday after his house was swept away by floods. France will recognize a state of natural disaster for Guadeloupe, President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter on Sunday.   read more  Our Standards:  The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hurricane-fiona-barrels-toward-puerto-rico-with-heavy-winds-rain-2022-09-18/,Reuters,Neutral
"5 years after Maria, reconstruction drags on in Puerto Rico",DÁNICA COTO,9/18/22,"Jetsabel Osorio Chévere looked up with a sad smile as she leaned against her battered home. Nearly five years have gone by since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, and no one has offered her family a plastic tarp or zinc panels to replace the roof that the Category 4 storm ripped off the two-story home in an impoverished corner in the north coast town of Loiza. “No one comes here to help,” the 19-year-old said. It’s a familiar lament in a U.S. territory of 3.2 million people where thousands of homes, roads and recreational areas have yet to be fixed or rebuilt since Maria struck in September 2017. The government has completed only 21% of more than 5,500 official post-hurricane projects, and seven of the island’s 78 municipalities report that not a single project has begun. Only five municipalities report that half of the projects slated for their region have been completed, according to an Associated Press review of government data. And with Hurricane Fiona forecast to hit Puerto Rico on Sunday with torrential rains, more than 3,600 homes still have a tattered blue tarp serving as a makeshift roof. “That is unacceptable,” said Cristina Miranda, executive director of local nonprofit League of Cities. “Five years later, uncertainty still prevails.” Puerto Rico’s governor and Deanne Criswell, head of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency who recently visited the island, stressed that post-hurricane work is underway, but many wonder how much longer it will take and worry another devastating storm will hit in the meantime. Criswell said officials focused on recovery and emergency repairs for the first three years after Maria. Reconstruction has now started, she noted, but will take time because authorities want to ensure the structures being built are robust enough to withstand stronger hurricanes projected as a result of climate change. “We recognize the concern that recovery may seem like it’s not moving fast enough five years later,” she said. “Hurricane Maria was a catastrophic event that caused damages that are really complex.” The hurricane damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes and caused an estimated 2,975 deaths after razing the island’s power grid. Crews only recently started to rebuild the grid with more than $9 billion of federal funds. Island-wide blackouts and daily power outages persist, damaging appliances and forcing those with chronic health conditions to find temporary solutions to keep their medications cold. The slow pace has frustrated many on an island emerging from the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Some Puerto Ricans have opted to rebuild themselves instead of waiting for government help they feel will never come. Osorio, the 19-year-old from Loiza, said her family bought a tarp and zinc panels out of their own pockets and set up a new roof over their second floor. But it leaks, so now she lives with her father and grandfather on the first floor. Meanwhile, in the island’s central region, community leaders who accused the government of ignoring rural areas formed a nonprofit, vowing to never go through what they experienced after Maria. They’ve built their own well, opened a community center in an abandoned school and used their own equipment to repair a key road. They also opened a medical clinic in April and certified nearly 150 people in emergency response courses. “That’s what we’re seeking, to not depend on anyone,” said Francisco Valentín with the Primary Health Services and Socioeconomic Development Corporation. “We’ve had to organize ourselves because there’s no other option.” Municipal officials also have grown tired of waiting for help. In the southern coastal town of Peñuelas, Mayor Gregory Gonsález said he sought permission to hire special brigades to repair roads, ditches and other infrastructure, with work starting in mid-September. It is one of five municipalities that has not seen a single post-hurricane project completed, with a pier, medical center, government office and a road still awaiting reconstruction. Gonsález said that few companies make bids because they lack employees, or they quote a price higher than that authorized by federal officials as inflation drives up the cost of materials. It’s a frustration shared by Josian Santiago, mayor of the central mountain town of Comerío. He said it’s urgent that crews repair the main road that connects his town to the capital of San Juan because landslides are closing it down with increasing frequency. Tropical Storm Earl was blamed for causing eight landslides on Sept. 6, just hours before it became a hurricane. “It’s a terrible risk,” Santiago said, adding that engineers recently told him it could take another two years to repair. “Two years?! How much longer do we have to wait?!” Reminders of how much time has passed since Hurricane Maria hit are scattered across Puerto Rico. Faded red plastic tassels tied around wooden electrical posts that still lean as much as 60 degrees flapped in the wind as Tropical Storm Earl dumped heavy rain across the island in early September. Norma López, a 56-year-old homemaker, has a post leaning just feet away from her balcony in Loiza, and it exasperates her every time she sees it. “It’s still there. About to fall,” said López, who lost her roof to Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and again to Maria. “I’m here trying to survive.” Sixty-five-year-old Virmisa Rivera, who lives nearby, said her roof leaks every time it rains, and the laminated walls near her bedroom are permanently soaked. She said FEMA gave her $1,600 to rent a house while it repaired her roof, but no crews came by. Her boyfriend, who recently died, attempted to install zinc panels, but they don’t protect from heavy rain. “My house is falling apart,” she said, adding that the government said it would move her to a new home in another neighborhood since it can’t repair hers because it’s in a flood zone. But Rivera worries she will die if she moves: She takes 19 pills a day and uses an oxygen tank daily. Her family lives next door, which gives her security since she now lives alone. Family also is the reason Osorio, the 19-year-old, would like to see a roof for the second floor. It’s where her mother raised her and her sister before dying. Osorio was 12, so her younger sister was sent to live with an aunt. Plywood panels now cover the windows of the second floor that her mother built by hand with cinderblocks. It’s where she taught Osorio how to make candles and cloth wipes for babies that they used to sell, sitting side-by-side while Osorio talked about her school day. “This is my mother’s,” Osorio said as she motioned to the second floor, “and that’s where I plan to live.”","https://apnews.com/article/storms-caribbean-hurricanes-puerto-rico-5523cce6806b78269b3122afcfd93ce4

Puerto Rico girds for possible hurricane as TS Fiona nears,DÁNICA COTO,9/18/22,"Tropical Storm Fiona headed for Puerto Rico on Saturday night, with forecasters warning it likely would grow into a hurricane before hitting on Sunday with extremely heavy rains with the potential to cause landslides, severe flooding and power outages. The storm already lashed several eastern Caribbean islands, with one death reported in the French territory of Guadeloupe. More than 20 other people were rescued amid heavy wind and rain that left 13,000 customers without power, with the storm tearing up roads, downing trees and destroying at least one bridge. Fiona was centered 150 miles (240 kilometers) southeast of Ponce, Puerto Rico, late Saturday and had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph) on a path forecast to pass near or over Puerto Rico on Sunday. Fiona was expected to become a hurricane before reaching Puerto Rico’s southern coast. “We are already starting to feel its effects,” Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said at a news conference in which the lights briefly went out as he spoke, prompting groans and laughs across the island. “We should not underestimate this storm.” Officials said the heavy rains anticipated would be dangerous because the island’s soil is already saturated. “We’re not saying that the winds aren’t dangerous, but we are preparing for a historic event in terms of rain,” said Ernesto Morales, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in San Juan. Many Puerto Ricans worried about serious power outages since the reconstruction of the island’s power grid razed by Hurricane Maria in 2017 only recently began. The grid remains fragile and power outages occur daily. Luma, the company that operates the transmission and distribution of power on the island, said it flew in an extra 100 lineworkers ahead of the storm but warned of “significant” outages over the weekend. Fiona was forecast to swipe past the Dominican Republic on Monday as a potential hurricane and then Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands with the threat of extreme rain. Forecasters posted a hurricane warning for the coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo. In Puerto Rico, authorities opened shelters and closed public beaches, casinos, theaters and museums as they urged people to remain indoors. Officials also transferred hundreds of endangered Puerto Rican parrots to their shelter. “It’s time to activate your emergency plan and contact and help your relatives, especially elderly adults who live alone,” said Dr. Gloria Amador, who runs a nonprofit health organization in central Puerto Rico. The governor said an elderly man died shortly after arriving at a shelter in the tiny island of Culebra that lies just east of Puerto Rico. He said that the man was living in squalid conditions and that the mayor had been trying to relocate him, calling it “quite an unfortunate incident.” Pierluisi said $550 million in emergency funds were available to deal with the storm’s aftermath along with enough food to feed 200,000 people for 20 days three times a day. At least one cruise ship visit and several flights to the island were canceled, while authorities in the eastern Caribbean islands canceled school and prohibited people from practicing aquatic sports as Fiona battered the region. On Guadeloupe, authorities said they recorded wind gusts of up to 74 mph (120 kph). They also said 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain fell in three hours in the Gros Morne area. Fiona, which is the Atlantic hurricane season’s sixth named storm, was predicted to bring 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in eastern and southern Puerto Rico, with as much as 20 inches (51 centimeters) in isolated spots. Rains of 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) were forecast for the Dominican Republic, with up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) in places. Life-threatening surf also was possible from Fiona’s winds, forecasters said. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lester in the eastern Pacific dissipated Saturday afternoon after making landfall to the south of Acapulco on Mexico’s southwestern coast. The hurricane center said Lester’s remnants could still drop from 8 to 12 inches (20 to 31 centimeters) of rain on the coasts of upper Guerrero state and Michoacan state, with isolated areas getting 16 inches (41 centimeters). Tropical Storm Madeline formed deeper in the Pacific, but forecasters predicted it would not pose any threat to land as it moved farther out to sea.","https://apnews.com/article/floods-storms-caribbean-hurricanes-mexico-4c5ff291888f47d8fd410400440c7d1e

One man was found dead in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, after heavy rains from the massive storm swept away his house in the BasseTerre district, according to local authorities.   read more  The storm was about 75 miles (120 km) southeast of St Croix and about 150 miles (240 km) southeast of Puerto Rico with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) as of Saturday night, according to NHC. It was expected to become a hurricane on Sunday and into Sunday night, as it moves near Puerto Rico. A storm is considered a Category 1 hurricane when sustained windspeeds reach 74 mph or greater. The island was braced for up to 20 inches (50 cm) of rain and high winds that could bring flooding, mudslides and power outages. ""Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of Puerto Rico Sunday and Sunday night, and are possible across the U.S. Virgin Islands (Saturday night) and Sunday,"" NHC said. Heavy rains from Fiona were also due to spread to the Dominican Republican on Sunday and to the Turks and Caicos Islands on Monday night.

Talks to restructure Puerto Rico power company debt fail,DÁNICA COTO,9/17/22,"Mediation talks to restructure more than $9 billion in debt held by Puerto Rico’s power company failed, officials announced Saturday, raising concerns about the future of the bankrupt government agency. A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances said the impasse with bondholders means it would resume litigation against them in an attempt to restructure the debt, warning that any cost associated with debt repayment would be passed along to consumers. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the mediation did not achieve the desired outcome: “My administration cannot accept a deal that unduly strains the wallets of our hard-working families, or the resources businesses need to fuel our economy and create and maintain jobs on the island.” In a press conference on Saturday, Pierluisi said the power company will remain in a state of bankruptcy given pending litigations. Creditors could not be immediately reached for comment. Board member Justin Peterson criticized the board for abandoning mediation efforts as he advocated for bondholders to be paid and said that a deal to end bankruptcy and avoid expensive and lengthy litigation “was clearly in reach.” “It would have catalyzed much-needed private sector investment to rebuild and modernize Puerto Rico’s grid and would have provided the citizens...with cleaner, more reliable and more affordable power,” he said. “Now, all of this could be delayed for years.” Puerto Rico’s power grid remains frail after Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017, with outages reported daily. The grid was already crumbling before the storm hit as a result of aging infrastructure and a lack of maintenance. The failed talks come after Gov. Pedro Pierluisi announced in early March that his administration was scrapping a proposed debt restructuring deal for the island’s Electric Power Authority that was several years in the making because it wasn’t feasible or in Puerto Rico’s best interest. The power company’s debt is the largest of any government agency, and economists have said that restructuring it would help boost economic development on an island mired in a deep economic crisis. It is one of two government agencies whose debt have yet to be restructured more than five years after Puerto Rico’s government filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in history. Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority still holds $5.8 billion in debt.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-economy-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-c7472f4e779e797b502c95cadb59d124

"Storm Fiona poses threat for Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic",No Author,9/16/22,"Tropical Storm Fiona passed near Guadeloupe on Friday evening, hitting some of the Caribbean’s easternmost islands with strong rain and wind as forecasters warned the storm could later threaten Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic with dangerous rains. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Fiona was then likely to become a hurricane near the Bahamas next week. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lester in the eastern Pacific was on a projected path that could bring landfall near the Acapulco area on Mexico’s southwestern coast Saturday. The center said Fiona would pass into the eastern Caribbean during Friday night and would then slow its forward movement. It was predicted to be close to Puerto Rico late Saturday and then cross over the Dominican Republic on Monday. The forecast called for rainfall totals of as much as a foot (30 centimeters) in places across eastern and southern Puerto Rico and 16 inches (41 centimeters) in the eastern Dominican Republic. That much rain could cause flash floods and mudslides in higher terrain, and life-threatening surf was possible from Fiona’s winds, the hurricane center said. The Atlantic hurricane season’s sixth named storm had maximum sustained winds of about 50 mph (85 kph) late Friday afternoon, the center said. Little change in strength was expected during the next few days. Fiona was moving westward at 15 mph (24 kph), and was centered about 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of Guadeloupe. Tropical storm warnings were in effect for most of the Leeward Islands. In the Pacific, Lester was expected to remain a tropical storm until hitting the Mexican coast Saturday, but forecasters warned of potential dangers from heavy rains. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) early Friday evening. It was centered 215 miles (345 kilometers) southeast of Acapulco and moving moving to the northwest at 12 mph (19 kph). A tropical storm warning was up from Puerto Escondido to Zihuatanejo. The hurricane center said Lester could drop from 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) of rain on the coasts of upper Guerrero state and Michoacan state, with isolated areas getting 16 inches (41 centimeters).","https://apnews.com/article/storms-caribbean-dominican-republic-puerto-rico-tropical-c0189d111093558331aa2f29b7d481da

Puerto Rico star Ricky Martin faces sexual assault complaint,DÁNICA COTO,9/10/22,"A sexual assault complaint has been filed against Puerto Rico pop star Ricky Martin, who recently sued his nephew over what he said were false allegations of sexual abuse. The complaint was filed Friday at a police precinct in the capital of San Juan, police spokesman Edward Ramírez told The Associated Press on Saturday. Information including who filed the complaint and details of the allegations are not public, given the nature of the complaint. A person who was not authorized to speak about the case confirmed that Martin’s nephew, Dennis Yadiel Sánchez Martin, filed the complaint. The person said the complaint does not automatically trigger an arrest because the alleged incident is not recent, adding that police will investigate and determine whether charges are warranted. Sánchez previously requested a restraining order against Martin in July, but a judge later archived the case after Sánchez admitted under oath that he had never been sexually assaulted by the singer. Flavia Fernández, a spokeswoman for Martin, told the AP that his legal team is evaluating the situation and not issuing public comment for now. On Thursday, the artist’s attorneys filed a lawsuit against his nephew, whom they described as “troubled.” They accused him of extortion, malicious persecution, abuse of law and damages. They said Sánchez’s allegations cost Martin at least $10 million worth of canceled contracts and projects, plus another $20 million in damages to his reputation. The lawsuit states that Sánchez would send up to 10 messages a day to Martin, the majority “meaningless diatribes without any particular purpose.” It also accuses him of publishing Martin’s private number, forcing him to change it. In addition, the lawsuit said Sánchez falsely claimed he had a romantic relationship with Martin for seven months and that the singer didn’t want it to end and would call Sánchez with frequency. “Nothing further from the truth,” the lawsuit stated. Attorneys also noted that a judge previously issued Sánchez two restraining orders in an unrelated stalking case.","https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-caribbean-sexual-assault-9409cc1d30676ce93daa2f0dc6c335a8

"Cole lifts US by Puerto Rico in AmeriCup quarters, 85-84",No Author,9/9/22,"Norris Cole made sure that USA Basketball will play for a medal at AmeriCup. Cole — a two-time NBA champion with the Miami Heat — scored a game-high 20 points, capping it off by making the game-winning runner with 1.4 seconds remaining, and the U.S. rallied past Puerto Rico 85-84 in an AmeriCup quarterfinal game Thursday. It was the game’s seventh and final lead change, the last two of those coming in the final 6.1 seconds. “I just wanted to make a play for the team,” said Cole, who had the final eight points for the U.S. “The team trusted me, drew up a play for me to catch it and I was able to make a play. Moments like that, everybody dreams about, but I work hard at my individual game along with the team game, I was able to show my individual talent within the team concept, and it worked out.” Jeremy Pargo scored 15 points for the U.S., which got 11 from Zylan Cheatham and 10 from Stephen Zimmerman. “We’re fortunate to win,” U.S. coach Alex Jensen said. “They did a good job preparing for us. We got lucky. But hopefully it’s a good lesson for us moving forward.” Tremont Waters and Ethan Thompson each scored 16 for Puerto Rico. Waters had a layup with 6.1 seconds left to put his team up by one, and that set the stage for the last U.S. possession. Cole got the inbounds pass, drove with a left-hand dribble, took off from near the corner of the lane, changed hands and got the shot to fall to put the Americans back on top. He punched the air in celebration — but the Americans needed one more stop. They got it, in part because Puerto Rico didn’t get a great look. All Waters could do was take a desperation heave from the deep right corner, it missed, and the U.S. escaped. “We were 1 second from winning this game,” said Puerto Rico coach Nelson Colon, whose team led by 10 midway through the second quarter. “I can’t say anything more than ‘thank you’ to all my players, all my staff, all my managers, who helped us and supported us in this tournament.” The Americans will face Argentina in Saturday’s semifinals, with the medal-round games — either for gold or bronze — coming Sunday. Argentina is 4-0 in the tournament, rolling past Venezuela 76-53 in another quarterfinal Thursday. All four wins for Argentina have come by double figures, an average of 20.3 points. “It only gets harder after this,” Jensen said. In the first quarterfinal Thursday, Canada eliminated Mexico 82-77. Next up for Canada is a semifinal matchup with Brazil, which held off the Dominican Republic in the fourth and final quarterfinal game on Thursday night. FRIDAY’S SCHEDULE There are no games Friday. The semifinals are Saturday, with the third-place and championship games Sunday. ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-brazil-puerto-rico-7e295b60482c1031018486672615e348

Banker in bribe scandal pleads not guilty in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,8/31/22,"An international banker accused of bribing Puerto Rico’s then-governor to undermine an investigation into his institution turned himself in on Wednesday, almost a month after he was charged in federal court. Julio Herrera Velutini, who is a citizen of Venezuela and Italy and who was thought to be living in the United Kingdom, pleaded not guilty hours after he was arrested in Puerto Rico and was ordered held on a $1 million secured bond. Herrera faces several charges, including bribery and honest services wire fraud — which implies a third party being harmed by the bribery or kickbacks. Federal authorities said the Puerto Rico-based Bancredito International Bank & Trust that Herrera owned came under scrutiny in 2019 when Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions began probing suspicious transactions that the bank did not report. Officials alleged that Herrera and a former FBI agent who served as his consultant promised to financially support former Gov. Wanda Vázquez’s 2020 campaign for governor if she dismissed the commissioner and appointed a new one of Herrera’s choosing.  Authorities said Vázquez accepted the bribe, demanded the commissioner’s resignation and appointed a former consultant for Herrera’s bank as the new commissioner in May 2020. Officials said Herrera and Mark Rossini, the ex-FBI agent, then paid more than $300,000 to political consultants to support Vázquez’s campaign. Rossini, who was in Spain and turned himself in days after he was accused, has pleaded not guilty. Vázquez was arrested in Puerto Rico and was released on a $50,000 unsecured bond after pleading not guilty. The judge, Giselle López-Soler, allowed Herrera to live in New York ahead of the trial, adding that he must surrender his passport once he arrives. His bank is in the process of being liquidated.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-7764ce877148d6d4dccb83dcfe50929b

Company pledges to reduce Puerto Rico outages amid anger,DÁNICA COTO,8/24/22,"Persistent power outages and threats from Puerto Rico’s government prompted a company that operates the island’s transmission and distribution system to announce Wednesday that it would dedicate more resources and crews to improve service. The move came just hours after the U.S. territory’s Senate launched a hearing to analyze the government’s contract with Luma Energy — a consortium made up of Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston — amid calls to cancel it. Among the top officials demanding that the government revoke the contract is Puerto Rico’s Senate President José Luis Dalmau, of the main opposition party, and Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress and a member of the governor’s party, who said power outages have become “our daily bread.” Luma said Wednesday that it would increase response brigades by 25% in the next month, remove vegetation covering 20 of the most critical transmission lines, increase inspections of substations — eight of which have caught on fire in the past year — and increase aerial inspections of remote transmission lines. “We have made mistakes. We recognize our faults,” said Duke Austin, president and CEO of Quanta Services. He said Luma has reduced the duration of outages by one-third, but added that the company can do better. “I’m not asking for forgiveness or patience,” he said. “I am out of both myself.” Luma has stressed it is dealing with a power grid whose maintenance the local government neglected for decades and that was razed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, with reconstruction efforts having started just months ago. Prior to Luma, Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is more than $9 billion in debt, managed the grid’s transmission and distribution. The ongoing outages have angered many who note that power fluctuations have fried costly appliances and forced them find alternatives to keep life-saving medication cold as Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau has approved seven electricity rate increases so far this year at Luma’s request. A day before Luma made the announcement, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the company would face consequences if it doesn’t improve its service, although he didn’t provide details of what action he would take. “Time is going by, and my patience is running out,” he said. “Basically, they have to act, and act with a sense of urgency.” Pierluisi first spoke out against Luma last Thursday, a turnaround for a governor who had persistently defended the company ever since its contract began in June 2021. He said he became upset last week after learning that one recent outage was a result of not pruning vegetation around a main transmission line. “That is completely unacceptable,” he said. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau issued a report late last week noting there’s been an overall increase in the duration of outages per customer every month since January, lasting more than 21 hours at a time. In addition, it stated there has been no improvement in the frequency of interruptions. The bureau gave Luma and Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority until Sept. 1 to explain the drop in those and other metrics as it threatened to impose penalties.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-power-outages-puerto-rico-quanta-services-inc-43e8e5f3cf285e719a1119e427e387a2

Puerto Rico governor denounces power company amid outages,DÁNICA COTO,8/18/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Thursday denounced the private company his administration contracted to take over the island’s power transmission and distribution system amid a recent spike in electricity outages that have outraged many in the U.S. territory. It is the first time Gov. Pedro Pierluisi has publicly criticized Luma Energy — a consortium made up of Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston — despite street protests and calls on social media for Pierluisi to cancel Luma’s 15-year contract that began in June 2021. “I am not satisfied with the performance of Luma,” said Pierluisi, who previously had defended and praised the company. “It is obvious to me that you have to make changes to your execution plan to significantly improve the service you are offering our people.” Hours later, Luma officials held a press conference where they said progress has been made and said the neglect and mismanagement that occurred under Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is trying to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, are not going to be fixed in a year. “We recognize and acknowledge that there are significant challenges that remain to be addressed,” said CEO Wayne Stensby. “I know that the people of Puerto Rico are tired of excuses and the constant blaming of someone else.” Luma’s roughly 1.5 million clients have been hit by power outages that have worsened in recent months and have forced some businesses to close since they cannot afford to run generators on expensive fuel. One of Puerto Rico’s largest hospitals was left without power last week when one of its generators failed in the middle of an outage. Luma and Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority have blamed aging infrastructure, lack of maintenance, bad weather, sargassum and even an iguana for the blackouts. Officials also stress they’re working with a system just now being rebuilt after Hurricane Maria razed the U.S. territory’s power grid in September 2017.  Pierluisi said that was not an excuse. “Although I recognize that the electrical network we have is fragile and obsolete, it is Luma’s responsibility to operate it under the critical and emergency state in which it finds itself,” he said. Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau released a report Thursday night that showed an overall increase in the duration of outages per customer every month since January, averaging 21 hours. It said there has been no improvement in the frequency of interruptions.  The bureau said Luma and Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority have until Sept. 1 to explain the slump in those and other metrics as it threatened to impose penalties. Luma officials, however, said there have been 30% fewer power outages this year than last year. Stensby also said his company has repaired some 3,800 electric posts, replaced 10,000 streetlights that had remained dark since Maria and launched 209 post-hurricane projects with federal funds, 14 of which are under construction.  But fires at substations have become increasingly common, and Puerto Ricans have posted social media videos of crackling and sizzling equipment, as well as pictures of what they say are absurdly high power bills. Seven electricity rate increases requested by Luma have been approved by Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau this year alone. “There is no governmental action to address these problems,” said José Luis Dalmau, president of Puerto Rico’s Senate and a member of the main opposition party. “It’s unacceptable that in the face of this chaos, the governor is alienated from the reality that people are experiencing.” Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau announced an investigation into a power outage Wednesday that affected some 250,000 clients and led to a 25% loss in overall energy generated. “To the extent that LUMA and the (Power) Authority fail, and they argue over who is to blame, it will be up to us ... to assign responsibilities and demand improvements,” the bureau said. Among those affected by Wednesday’s outage was Jacqueline Santiago, who lives along Puerto Rico’s southern coast. “This happens all the time,” she said, adding that people in her neighborhood have lost microwaves, refrigerators and televisions as a result of the outages and constant power fluctuations. “We are incredibly frustrated.” Santiago said she was pleased Pierluisi spoke out against Luma, but believes he had no other choice: “With what face is he going to keep defending them?” In addition to intermittent outages, Puerto Rico was hit with an islandwide blackout in April that officials blamed on a fire that occurred at a main power plant. The spike in outages concerns many who note that the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, with meteorologists forecasting a seventh straight unusually busy season. Julia Nazario, mayor of the northern coastal town of Loiza, said some neighborhoods have experienced outages every day for the past week: “This is not OK.”","https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-quanta-services-inc-climate-and-environment-5049018d7ae13c5fe09a6b054c2d177d

Puerto Rico cruise ship docks face $425M public-private deal,DÁNICA COTO,8/16/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Tuesday announced a public-private partnership to overhaul the island’s cruise ship docks as part of a $425 million project to boost the U.S. territory’s tourism sector. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the project aims to transform Puerto Rico into the Caribbean’s main cruise ship destination by modernizing, repairing and expanding nine docks located in the capital of San Juan to receive larger vessels and more passengers. “It’s an extremely important day for tourism in Puerto Rico,” said Carlos Mercado, executive director for the island’s Tourism Company. San Juan Cruise Port — a subsidiary of London-based Global Ports Holding, the world’s largest cruise port operator — will be responsible for operating and overseeing the project as part of a 30-year deal with Puerto Rico’s Ports Authority that was five years in the making. The contract states the island’s government will receive annual payments representing at least 5% of the operator’s gross income. As part of the deal, the number of docks currently capable of serving as base port for four cruise ships at a time will double to eight. Crews also will modernize docks battered by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 and that have been worn down throughout the decades, with the first one being built in the 1970. “We haven’t been able to compete on a large scale with other jurisdictions,” Pierluisi said. Joel Pizá, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Ports Authority, said the docks are currently not designed to receive larger ships or 5,000 passengers or more at a time. He also noted that the agency is $350 million in debt, which makes it hard to issue bonds to repair and improve docks despite federal officials identifying serious structural deficiencies that would require more than $200 million to fix. “This is the reality,” he said. “Capital investment is more than needed at this moment.” The maximum docking fee and passenger fee are not expected to change as part of the deal, officials said. The announcement is the latest public-private partnership that the U.S. territory has launched as the central government and certain public agencies emerge from a deep bankruptcy amid an ongoing economic crisis. Previous partnerships have led private companies to take over management and operation of the island’s main international airport, certain highways and the transmission and distribution of power, among others. Some have criticized the newest partnership, demanding that federal officials scrutinize the privatization of some $5 billion of infrastructure for an upfront initial investment of $75 million. Puerto Rico Rep. Ángel Matos García, spokesman for the majority of the island’s House of Representatives, said he and other politicians will be meeting with federal officials in Washington, D.C. to talk about the deal. Tourism represents less than 7% of Puerto Rico’s economy, but officials hope to change that with the newest partnership, with work slated to start next year.  Puerto Rico saw a record number of cruise ship passengers prior to the pandemic, only for the docks to shut down for 16 months. But business has since rebounded. The government reported more than 420,000 passengers in fiscal year 2021-2022, a 23% recovery compared with the 2018-2019 fiscal year This fiscal year, officials expect more than 1 million passengers — roughly 80% of pre-pandemic traffic — with eight new cruise ships scheduled to visit the San Juan port for the first time.","https://apnews.com/article/travel-caribbean-puerto-rico-san-juan-fe05991a3be3279e574b2b7238e81ee4

Environmental groups sue US over Puerto Rico dredging plan,DÁNICA COTO,8/16/22,"The Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S government, accusing it of endangering wildlife and humans as it prepares to dredge and expand Puerto Rico’s biggest bay to accommodate massive tankers that will serve a new liquid natural gas terminal. The Arizona-based nonprofit said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ $60 million project would remove 2.2 million cubic yards of seafloor sediment to deepen and widen San Juan Bay’s shipping channels. Dredging would last more than a year, and some of the material could be transported to the nearby Condado Lagoon Estuarine Reserve, which is popular with locals and tourists who swim, snorkel and paddleboard its waters, where manatees and starfish are a common sight. The lawsuit also states that several “overburdened environmental justice communities” near and around the U.S. territory’s north coast could be at risk from pollution, explosions and oil spills if the dredging is completed and the terminal starts operating. It noted that the Corps did not consult with communities that could be affected. “This project will destroy corals and threaten communities and deepen the island’s dangerous dependence on fossil fuels,” Catherine Kilduff, an attorney for the center, told The Associated Press. The center and two environmental groups — CORALations and El Puente de Williamsburg Inc. — filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and others. They have 60 days to respond, and then both sides would make arguments before a judge issues a decision that can be appealed. Spokeswomen for the Corps and for Fish & Wildlife Service said the agencies are unable to comment on pending litigation. The Corps previously stated that dredged materials in the Condado Lagoon would fill depressions and create seagrass habitat. The lawsuit states that the Corps submitted an environmental assessment instead of a more rigorous environmental impact statement and accused it of reaching an erroneous determination in August 2018 that dredging would have no environmental impact. The lawsuit noted that more than 1.5 million people live in eight cities and towns that surround the San Juan Bay: “The coastal economy Is connected to the bay and its health.” If the dredging project is completed, tankers transporting petroleum and liquefied natural gas would carry about six times the capacity of vessels that currently use Puerto Rico’s busiest harbor. It’s located in a bay that is part of a larger ecosystem made up of rivers, lagoons and a smaller bay that cover 3,400 acres and are home to threatened and endangered animals including four types of sea turtles, manatees and the yellow-shouldered blackbird. Kilduff said the nonprofits are demanding an environmental impact statement in part because of new information on how dredging smothers corals. “So much of Puerto Rico’s economy depends on coastal resources like tourism and fishing,” she said. The lawsuit also warned that the dredging project would “hasten damage, weathering and erosion of the coast and structures” including two massive historic forts that guarded San Juan Bay during colonial times. The nonprofits said a smaller project with more robust mitigation such as the use of sediment curtains and requiring new seals on barges could reduce environmental damage. “The agency failed to take a ‘hard look’ at the direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts of its decision before acting,” the lawsuit stated. The complaint is the latest hit on plans to build a liquefied natural gas import terminal in San Juan that has come under intense scrutiny. In June, a federal appeals court ruled that New York-based New Fortress Energy Inc. did not obtain the necessary permits before starting construction of the terminal and must face a review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Environmental groups have long rejected construction of the terminal as they demand that Puerto Rico lessen its dependence on fossil fuels, which generate about 97% of the island’s electricity. Natural gas represents roughly 44% and petroleum another 37%. Renewables account for only 3%.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-lawsuits-wildlife-puerto-rico-2ebe90248828ad9947cdc4553959aff0

"Puerto Rico bay dredging will lock in fossil fuel dependence, say enviros",Clark Mindock,8/16/22," U.S. government approvals for an expansion of San Juan Bay threaten to lock in reliance on fossil fuels in Puerto Rico for years to come, despite the territory's ambitious climate commitments,  environmentalists said  in a lawsuit filed Tuesday. Environmental groups asked a D.C. federal court to vacate approvals for dredging in the bay to widen shipping channels for the transport of fossil fuels. The plaintiffs said the approvals were rushed and ignored potential damage to endangered coral and sea turtles, health harms to disadvantaged communities and fears the project would promote reliance on natural gas despite the island’s mandate for 100% renewable energy for electricity needs by 2050. The dredging project will make it easier to ship larger quantities of oil and liquefied natural gas to terminals along the bay, according to the complaint. Currently, fuel tankers must lighten their loads to reach petroleum and LNG terminals in the bay, the Army Corps of Engineers noted in a 2018 report. Plaintiffs Center for Biological Diversity, El Puente and Coralations say the project hampers the goals of a 2019 mandate to transition away from fossil fuels, which passed following the landfalls of hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.Those storms caused widespread power outages and highlighted the vulnerabilities of the traditionally fossil fuel and tourismdependent island, said Catherine Kilduff, a senior attorney for Center for Biological Diversity. “Puerto Rico is on track to 100% renewables and this project is the federal government undermining that,” she told Reuters. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment. The port expansion calls for the dredging and disposal of more than two million cubic yards of sediment. Government agencies conducted various environmental reviews and the Army Corps of Engineers issued approvals for the project in August 2018. The case is El Puente v.

7 accused in $1.2M extortion scheme at Puerto Rico docks,No Author,8/15/22,"Federal authorities on Monday arrested seven people including a union leader and various dock workers accused in a $1.2 million extortion scheme that targeted shipping companies. U.S. Attorney Stephen Muldrow said the scheme began in 2005 and affected local and foreign commerce, including shipping between Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. He said suspects at three docks in the capital of San Juan are accused of illegally extorting small shipping companies and threatened to stop loading and unloading goods if a monthly fee wasn’t paid. The fee demanded varied by weight and sometimes ranged from $10,000 to $20,000 a month, Muldrow said. The indictment states that the shipping companies were charged a monthly fee in exchange for supposedly being allowed to use longshore workers who were not unionized. However, there were no labor unions representing employees of shipping companies operating at the piers where the alleged extortions occurred, officials said. The suspects face charges including conspiracy to violate the RICO Act, commit extortion and money laundering. “Breaking the law cannot be the way to do business in Puerto Rico,” said Joseph González, FBI special agent in charge of the San Juan office. Local and federal authorities were part of the five-year investigation, with some wearing shirts at a press conference that read “Pier Pressure” in reference to the operation.","https://apnews.com/article/arrests-money-laundering-puerto-rico-san-juan-a8637769c58055f562b26e79546706e7

Ex FBI agent turns self in to face Puerto Rico criminal case,DÁNICA COTO,8/9/22,"Former FBI agent Mark Rossini, who was indicted in a corruption case against a former Puerto Rico governor, turned himself into federal authorities Tuesday in the U.S. territory and declared himself not guilty, according to officials. The U.S. Attorney’s Office told The Associated Press that Rossini’s attorney had reached out to authorities just days after former Gov. Wanda Vázquez was arrested to hand over his client. Rossini is charged with conspiracy, federal program bribery and honest services wire fraud. He entered a not guilty plea during a brief court appearance in which a judge authorized that he could live in the U.S. mainland but not in Spain, where he is receiving cancer treatment. However, the judge said Rossini could travel to Spain for treatment. His attorney could not be immediately reached for comment. Last Thursday, hours after FBI agents arrested Vázquez, federal officials announced they were seeking Rossini, who was in Spain. Rossini was an FBI agent from roughly 1991 to 2008, when he resigned as part of a plea deal in which he pleaded guilty to criminally accessing a sensitive FBI database for personal purposes. Most of the searches were related to Anthony Pellicano, an infamous private detective for Hollywood stars who was charged in 2006 with wiretapping some celebrities and bribing a police officer. Authorities said Rossini had provided consulting services to an Italian-Venezuelan banker who had promised to financially support Vázquez’s 2020 campaign for governor in exchange for her dismissing the commissioner of Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions and appointed a new one of the banker’s choosing. The banker, identified as Julio Herrera Velutini and founder of Bancrédito International Bank & Trust, is believed to be in the United Kingdom and faces charges including conspiracy, bribery and fraud.  Authorities said he was seeking a new commissioner after the bank came under scrutiny for apparent suspicious financial transactions. After a new commissioner was installed, authorities said Herrera and Rossini paid more than $300,000 to political consultants to support Vázquez’s campaign. On Tuesday, the newest commissioner announced that the bank was being voluntarily liquidated. “What began in 2019 as a routine examination of one of the oldest and biggest international bank entities operating in Puerto Rico today reaches its final chapter,” said Commissioner Natalia Zequeira. She said the process could take up to six months, and that her office will ensure that the bank fulfills its obligations with all its clients. The bank also was ordered to pay $250,000 in sanctions. Banking officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-conspiracy-puerto-rico-1bf7b48f59c6be8eb1979a35e7a0a3eb

"1 dead after US Coast Guard, boat collide in Puerto Rico",No Author,8/9/22,"A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and a Puerto Rico fishing boat collided Monday in an incident that killed one person and injured another, officials said. The accident occurred in the early afternoon near the north coastal town of Dorado, according to a U.S. Coast Guard statement. The agency identified the dead fisherman as Carlos Rosario and said his brother, Samuel Rosario, was injured. The two were aboard a 23-foot (seven-meter) commercial fishing vessel called Desakata, while the U.S. Coast Guard was traveling in a 154-foot (47-meter) fast-response cutter, officials said. Capt. José Díaz, commander of the Coast Guard Sector San Juan, said a thorough investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is under way to determine what caused the collision and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. “We sincerely mourn the passing of Carlos Rosario,” he said. “We send our most heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and loved ones, and pray they find strength during this most difficult time.”","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-accidents-puerto-rico-transportation-ef066ec7b25930288ca770b7f34cecc8

Federal judge orders Puerto Rico landfill to stop operating,No Author,8/9/22,"A federal judge has ordered a town in northern Puerto Rico to immediately stop receiving waste at a 56-year-old landfill and take other actions to help protect the environment and people’s health. The order filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also requires that Toa Alta cover the landfill’s exposed areas and implement a system to manage storm water and contaminated liquid flowing from it. Officials said most of the landfill does not have a protective liner on the bottom, noting that such landfills were ordered closed by 1998. Municipal officials had earlier announced that it stopped using the landfill as of April 2022, and that it will continue to take action on the remaining requirements. The case stems from a complaint that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Toa Alta in February 2021 that stated the landfill’s conditions posed an “imminent and substantial endangerment.”","https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-us-environmental-protection-agency-department-of-justice-climate-and-environment-98b55c8a5b610f1ff0e9fe55a0edfa6e

Ex Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez charged with bribery,DÁNICA COTO,8/4/22,"Former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez was arrested Thursday on bribery charges linked to the financing of her 2020 campaign, the latest hit to an island with a long history of corruption that brought fresh political upheaval to the U.S. territory. Vázquez is accused of engaging in a bribery scheme from December 2019 through June 2020 — while she was governor — with several people, including a Venezuelan-Italian bank owner, a former FBI agent, a bank president and a political consultant. “I am innocent. I have not committed any crime,” she told reporters. ”I assure you that they have committed a great injustice against me.” The arrest embarrassed and angered many in Puerto Rico who believe the island’s already shaky image has been further tarnished, leaving a growing number of people who have lost faith in their local officials to wonder whether federal authorities are their only hope to root out entrenched government corruption. Concern over previous corruption cases led to a delay in federal aid for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria as the U.S. government implemented more safeguards. Thursday’s arrest also was a blow to Vázquez’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which is pushing to hold a referendum next year in a bid to become the 51st U.S. state.  Vázquez, 62, was the second woman to serve as Puerto Rico’s governor and the first former governor to face federal charges. Former Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá of the opposing Popular Democratic Party was charged with campaign finance violations while in office and was found not guilty in 2009. He had been the first Puerto Rico governor to be charged with a crime in recent history. “For the second time in our history, political power and public office are used to finance an electoral campaign,” said José Luis Dalmau, president of Acevedo’s party. “Using the power of the government to advance political agendas is unacceptable and an affront to democracy in Puerto Rico.” Vázquez’s consultant, identified as John Blakeman, and the bank president, identified as Frances Díaz, have pleaded guilty to participating in the bribery scheme, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. In early 2019, the international bank owned by Julio Martín Herrera Velutini was being scrutinized by Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions because of transactions authorities believed were suspicious and had not been reported by the bank. Authorities said Herrera and Mark Rossini, the former FBI agent who provided consulting services to Herrera, allegedly promised to financially support Vázquez’s 2020 campaign for governor in exchange for Vázquez dismissing the commissioner and appointing a new one of Herrera’s choosing. Authorities said Vázquez accepted the bribery offer and in February 2020 demanded the commissioner’s resignation. She then was accused of appointing a former consultant for Herrera’s bank as the new commissioner in May 2020. After the move, officials said Herrera and Rossini paid more than $300,000 to political consultants to support Vázquez’s campaign. A flurry of messages exchanged during that time between people involved in the case included a heart emoji attached to the commissioner’s resignation letter and three sealed lips emojis when someone provided Rossi’s name to Vázquez, who requested the name of “the guy from the FBI.” In addition, Herrera texted Rossini about the need for a campaign manager and said he didn’t want “a monkey from Puerto Rico.” After Vázquez lost the primary to current Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, authorities said Herrera then allegedly sought to bribe Pierluisi to end an audit into his bank with favorable terms. Herrera is accused of using intermediaries from April 2021 to August 2021 to offer a bribe to Pierluisi’s representative, who was actually acting under FBI orders, according to the indictment.  Officials said Herrera then ordered a $25,000 payment to a political action committee in hopes of trying to bribe Pierluisi. Stephen Muldrow, U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico, said Pierluisi is not involved in the case. Vázquez, Herrera and Rossini are each charged with conspiracy, federal programs bribery and honest services wire fraud. If they are found guilty on all counts, they could face up to 20 years in prison, officials said. Meanwhile, Díaz and Blakeman could face up to five years in prison, officials said. Muldrow said officials believe Herrera is in the United Kingdom and Rossini in Spain. It wasn’t clear if the U.S. would seek to extradite them. Rossini resigned from the FBI in November 2008 as part of a plea deal in which he pleaded guilty to criminally accessing a sensitive FBI database for personal purposes. Many of the searches were related to Anthony Pellicano, an infamous private eye for celebrities who was charged in 2006 with wiretapping certain stars and bribing a police officer. Attorneys for the other suspects charged in the case could not be immediately reached for comment. In mid-May, Vázquez’s attorney told reporters that he and his client were preparing for possible charges as the former governor at the time denied any wrongdoing. Vázquez was sworn in as governor in August 2019 after former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló stepped down following massive protests. She served until 2021, after losing the primaries of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party to Pierluisi. In a statement Thursday, Pierluisi said his administration will work with federal authorities to help fight corruption. “No one is above the law in Puerto Rico,” he said. “Faced with this news that certainly affects and lacerates the confidence of our people, I reiterate that in my administration, we will continue to have a common front with federal authorities against anyone who commits an improper act, no matter where it comes from or who it may implicate.” Vázquez previously served as the island’s justice secretary and a district attorney for more than 30 years. She became governor after Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court ruled that the swearing in of Pierluisi — who had only been nominated as secretary of state — as governor was unconstitutional. Vázquez at the time said she was not interested in running for office and would only finish the nearly two years left in Rosselló’s term. Rosselló had resigned in late July 2019 after tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the street, angry over corruption, mismanagement of public funds and an obscenity-laced chat in which he and 11 other men including public officials made fun of women, gay people and victims of Hurricane Maria, among others. Shortly after she was sworn in, Vázquez told the AP that her priorities were to fight corruption, secure federal hurricane recovery funds and help lift Puerto Rico out of a deep economic crisis as the government struggled to emerge from bankruptcy. During the interview, she told the AP that she had long wanted to be in public service: as a girl, she would stand on her balcony and hold imaginary trials, always finding the supposed defendants guilty.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-arrests-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-1759ee9d94e903dcfecac65073a028e2

"5 dead, 68 Haitians rescued from waters near Puerto Rico",DÁNICA COTO,7/29/22,"At least five Haitian migrants drowned and 68 others were rescued Thursday after a suspected human smuggling boat dropped the group off in waters near an uninhabited island west of Puerto Rico, officials said. The incident is the latest in a string of deadly voyages across the northern Caribbean carrying mostly Haitian migrants fleeing their country amid a deepening political and economic crisis and a spike in gang-related killings and kidnappings. Federal and local authorities searched the area near Mona Island for several hours after receiving a call from rangers with Puerto Rico’s Department of Natural Resources who first spotted the migrants. Officials determined that no additional people were missing, based on interviews with survivors, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad told The Associated Press. He said 41 men, 25 women and two children survived, adding that none had any urgent medical issues. Jeffrey Quiñones, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said all migrants aboard the boat were Haitians. Most human smuggling boats that carry Haitian migrants to Puerto Rico depart from the neighboring Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Some capsize in the treacherous Mona Passage that separates the two islands while other boats drop off migrants in tiny uninhabited islands before reaching Puerto Rico. In this case, the boat carrying the migrants fled the scene, Castrodad said. The rescue comes just days after authorities in the Bahamas recovered the bodies of 17 migrants and rescued 25 more after their boat capsized early Sunday. A criminal investigation is underway. In May, 11 Haitian women drowned and 38 others were saved after their boat sank near Puerto Rico. “This is happening every day,” Castrodad said. “Everyone runs the same risk and same danger.” A growing number of Haitians are fleeing their country as gangs grow more powerful following the July 7, 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. This week alone, authorities blamed gangs for setting a courthouse and a church on fire as turf wars in the capital of Port-au-Prince intensify. In addition, more than 470 people have been killed, injured or disappeared in less than a week amid gang fights in the nearby Cite Soleil slum, according to the United Nations. The French medical charity Doctors Without Borders issued a statement on Thursday saying it has seen a “significant increase” in the number of victims hit by stray bullets. One of its emergency centers tended to nearly 80 bullet wounds, the majority of them stray bullets, the organization said, adding that many residents are trapped at home and unable to leave because of the escalating violence as their bullet wounds fester. “In some of these areas, (the agency) can only treat patients in basements or windowless rooms, due to the danger of crossfire and stray bullets,” the medical charity said.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-smuggling-us-coast-guard-2ad1ab51984181a6f9c17612e95a0368

"US EPA chief views pollution in Puerto Rico, vows to fight for change",Valerie Volcovici,7/28/22," The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pledged to combat environmental injustice in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico during a tour of some of the Caribbean island’s most polluted sites this week. President Joe Biden has often cited protecting poor and minority communities from industrial pollution as a top priority and has pledged that 40% of federal clean energy investments will be channeled to the cause. ""We are hearing about environmental injustices that have been happening for decades that we need to resolve urgently,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told Reuters during his trip. ""And now we have the resources and the will to begin to address some of these concerns,"" he said. Regan’s trip, the fourth in his series of environmental justice tours, included a visit to the polluted Caño Martín Peña tidal channel in the San Juan Bay Estuary, and a neighborhood near a coalpowered generator operated by AES Corp  (AES.N)  in the south of the island where residents complain of the impacts of coal ash. ""We hope we will finally be heard,"" Wanda Figueroa, a resident of the Cataño community in San Juan, told Regan, detailing their exposure to sewage runoff. ""I do not want to leave my grandchildren with a community that is getting worse."" Still grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island's electric grid and infrastructure in 2017, community groups pleaded with the administrator to crack down on companies that pollute and give local communities more input into how federal funds are invested. Regan announced some new funding for Puerto Rico from the bipartisan infrastructure law, including $900,000 annually for five years to support its estuary program and $78 million to fund water infrastructure projects. On Monday, the EPA also sent a notice of violation to Virginiabased power company AES for exceeding mercury limits at its coal plant in Guayama. EPA had previously issued notices to AES for failure to publish air and water monitoring data. Victor Alvarado, a local resident who has led a yearslong campaign to force AES to close the plant, led Regan around the area, showing him roads that have been paved with coal ash and told him that plans the company submitted to clean up its ash piles are ""inadequate."" Carmen Suarez, another resident of Guayama, told Regan her son died of a rare when he turned 25 in 2019. She said doctors believed the coal plant pollution was the cause. An AES official did not immediately comment. Several Puerto Ricans also told Regan the local government has squandered an opportunity to use the rebuilding after Maria to bring cleaner renewable energy online rather than fossil fuels and build new infrastructure that can be an economic growth engine for poorer communities. ""We have had bad experiences with the money we were supposed to receive to rebuild after Maria. Our people don't believe the promises that are made,” said Wendymar Deliz, secretary of community emergency response group PASE, told Regan.

Five people found dead in Puerto Rico waters after human smuggling incident,Reuters,7/28/22," The bodies of five people have been recovered in waters near Mona Island in Puerto Rico, following a human smuggling event in which migrants were forced to get out of a makeshift wooden boat, U.S. officials said on Thursday. The bodies were found by Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources Park Rangers on Mona Island, the Coast Guard said in a statement, adding that 66 survivors including two minors were safely ashore. ""The smugglers basically forced the migrants to disembark, it appears that five of the migrants drowned in the process,"" said Jeffrey Quinones, public affairs officer for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in a telephone interview. Officials have not yet confirmed the nationalities of those on board, Quinones said. Mona Island, a nature reserve, is located between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico and has over the years been used by smugglers carrying people between the two. Migrants on that route are typically Dominican or Haitian. ""A lot of times (smugglers) leave people on Mona Island, leading them to believe that they're in Puerto Rico,"" Joel Seijo, a spokesman for Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, said. At least 11 people drowned in May when a vessel carrying Haitian migrants capsized near Puerto Rico, amid a steady increase in migrants attempting to reach U.S. shores in dangerous marine voyages.   read more  Our Standards:  The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/five-people-found-dead-puerto-rico-waters-after-human-smuggling-incident-2022-07-28/,Reuters,Neutral
EPA head to visit Puerto Rico on environmental justice tour,DÁNICA COTO,7/25/22,"Norma Quiñones spent four years without running water after Hurricane Maria destroyed the well that she and dozens of neighbors depend on in their community deep in the mountains of western Puerto Rico. Last Christmas, crews installed a new well, but the water is not treated, so Quiñones is forced to drive 45 minutes into town to buy nearly 100 bottles of water every week for her family. “It’s been years of suffering,” she said. A school nurse, the mother of two hopes their situation and others like it across the U.S. territory will change with the official visit this week of Michael Regan, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. He is expected to tour several poor communities on the island as part of a U.S. initiative dubbed “Journey to Justice” to learn how pollution has affected them. “It’s really important for me that we’re on the ground and we’re seeing these injustices up close,” Regan told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. “These are the same communities that are on the front line, facing the impact of climate change.” Regan’s first stop will be Tuesday at the Cano Martín Peña, considered one of Puerto Rico’s most polluted waterways. It is part of the San Juan Bay Estuary and is home to more than 25,000 people descended from impoverished migrants who arrived in the mid-1900s from the island’s rural areas. Community leader Lucy Cruz told AP that while federal and local officials have made funds available to clean the waterway and reduce flooding, problems include the lack of a sewage system. “This would not only be a change for the Cano Martín Peña community, but for all of Puerto Rico,” she said. On Wednesday, Regan is expected to visit at least two community drinking water systems in the northern city of Caguas and talk with residents about the challenges they face. He also is scheduled to stop at a facility in southern Puerto Rico that burns coal to produce energy and has long been the source of complaints and health concerns for those living nearby. “I’m headed to Puerto Rico not only to spotlight these injustices, but to listen and learn from the community so we can develop solutions together,” he said. The visit comes as Puerto Rico is slated to receive $78 million in EPA funds for water infrastructure projects. The local government will decide how the funds will be allocated, although Regan already has sent a letter that outlines the criteria for those resources and the agency’s expectations.  He also noted that much of the funding is available as grants or forgivable loans. “This means that communities that have never had a seat at the table can be eligible for those resources,” he said, adding that Puerto Rico has long suffered from air and water pollution. “For far too long, too many communities have gone neglected and that must stop now.” Quiñones, who lives more than two hours from the capital of San Juan, had hoped that Regan would stop by her community. Undeterred, she said she wrote him a letter detailing the woes of the damaged well. “Water is the most essential thing in life after air,” she said.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-pollution-san-juan-us-environmental-protection-agency-89dc9c1f581e11ef50c4620acd582f2b

Hurdler Camacho-Quinn cherishes Olympic gold for Puerto Rico,PAT GRAHAM,7/22/22,"This was what winning an Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico looked like for hurdler Jasmine Camacho-Quinn: Billboards around San Juan featuring only her first name. A festive, flag-waving parade just for her. Meeting some of the country’s biggest dignitaries.  Now, along with all of that, comes pressure — pressure to replicate that 100-meter hurdles gold medal at world championships and beyond. Despite being the best hurdler all last season, she viewed herself as an underdog in Tokyo, where she captured her nation’s first Olympic track and field gold. These days, that sort of role doesn’t apply. That medal placed a lot of extra weight on her shoulders, which she’s learning to deal with as she begins the first round of the hurdles at worlds on Saturday in Eugene, Oregon. “The pressure that’s on you, it can stress you out a little bit,” said Camacho-Quinn, who is from South Carolina and chose to represent Puerto Rico as an homage to her mom’s heritage. “You’re trying to be perfect at everything. You’re trying to have the same year, or something similar as you did the year before. “I’m actually handling it a lot better now, so that’s a good thing. I’m not super-nervous going into world championships.” On December 31, 2020, at 9:15 p.m., Camacho-Quinn took out her phone and in the notes folder wrote a few New Year’s resolutions:  — Buy a new house. — Get a new car. — Win an Olympic medal. Check, check and check.  To think, she was initially mad after crossing the line that day in Tokyo. Mad that she clipped the ninth hurdle. Mad that she didn’t set a world record.  “And then I just had to remind myself that I just won an Olympic gold medal,” Camacho-Quinn said with a laugh. “I snapped out of it.” It was quite a contrast to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, where she hit the eighth hurdle in her semifinal heat, stumbled over the ninth and crashed into the 10th. She crossed the finish line, dropped to her knees on the track and buried her head in her hands. The tears flowed.  Out of it, a promise — this wouldn’t happen again. She studied that race and what went wrong. Her trail leg was lagging a little bit. She cleaned up her form. She trained even harder. In Tokyo, she dominated the race and celebrated for a country where her mom is from. Camacho-Quinn was raised in South Carolina, but always had Puerto Rican influences around the house thanks to mom — music, food, celebrations. And while some may raise eyebrows at her representing the red, white and blue of Puerto Rico while growing up in the U.S. — hardly unheard-of, and completely reasonable given America’s deep stable of talent in the hurdles — she knows how much this medal meant to a nation of 3 million people. She’s reached celebrity status in the Caribbean island.  “The amount of love I received, that was amazing,” the 25-year-old said. “I just feel like that I just brought joy to everybody.” She was treated like royalty upon a return to Puerto Rico soon after the Olympics. There were billboards with just ” Jasmine ” in white letters set against a red backdrop. There was a parade that passed through the streets and proud Puerto Rican fans waving flags.  She also got to meet Roberto Clemente’s brother, Justino, who requested an audience with her. His house is a museum to his late brother, Roberto, the Hall of Fame outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates who died at 38 on Dec. 31, 1972. Justino added something else to his memorabilia collection — a poster of Camacho-Quinn. In addition, she was at a symposium with baseball standout Carlos Delgado. “It’s unfathomable the impact she’s made on the Puerto Rican community in the U.S. and of course in Puerto Rico,” her agent, Paul Doyle, said. To think, she didn’t even start training for the hurdles until eighth grade. She thought her career was on the balance beam as a gymnast, not in a lane on the track.  Really, Camacho-Quinn considers herself a sprinter who happens to compete in the hurdles — just like her dad, James, who was a hurdler at Charleston Southern University (it was Baptist College at Charleston before a name change in 1990). Her mom, Maria, was a sprinter and long jumper at the college, too. Camacho-Quinn went to school at the University of Kentucky, where she was a three-time NCAA champion. The school also produced one of Camacho-Quinn’s top rivals, world-record holder and Olympic silver medalist Keni Harrison of the U.S.  Camacho-Quinn’s big brother happens to be Robert Quinn, the Pro Bowl pass rusher with the Chicago Bears. When she won in Tokyo, the team posted his congratulations to his sister on Instagram as he walked off the field. He also did a little leap — like he was clearing a hurdle. She’s certainly on a roll these days, in hurdles and her new sport of bowling. She’s already posting scores in the 100s.  “I don’t know how to curve the ball yet, but I’m very interested in learning how to do that,” Camacho-Quinn said. “Because bowling is fun.” But bowling is not on the Olympic program.  “I’m good with track,” she cracked. ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-sports-parades-puerto-rico-eugene-de3e19cf1e7532cc302edb6276120fb6

Hundreds protest to demand Puerto Rico scrap contract with power grid operator,Reuters,7/21/22," Hundreds of people marched on Wednesday in Puerto Rico's capital San Juan to demand that the island's government cancel its contract with power grid operator LUMA Energy over chronic power outages and frequent rate hikes. Demonstrators including union leaders and community activists say LUMA has steadily increased power rates despite frequent outages including one in April that left more than one third of the island in darkness.   read more  Protestors shouted slogans including ""There goes LUMA, there goes LUMA with another increase"" and ""LUMA, a bunch of morons who burn substations.""

Puerto Rico team operator files antitrust suit vs league,The Associated Press,7/18/22,"The former operator of the Cangrejeros de Santurce baseball team has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Puerto Rican winter league, alleging it colluded with Puerto Rico Mayor Miguel Romero to remove him from the franchise. Cangrejeros investor/operator Tom Axon was suspended for two years and fined $5,000 by the league in March after he criticized Romero for poor conditions at the team’s Hiram Bithorn Stadium and threatened to move the club to Humacao. Axon’s lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Puerto Rico on Monday, demands that control of the franchise be returned to Axon’s companies along with triple damages from Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico Inc., operators of the league’s other teams and Impulse Sports Entertainment Corporation, which assumed control of the Cangrejeros after Axon was removed. “I am bringing this litigation because of my passion for Puerto Rican baseball and my desire to restore the Cangrejeros franchise and all of Puerto Rican baseball to its former glory, for the benefit of players, fans and the entire community,” Axon said in a statement. “No sports business is above the law.” Axon claims he offered to invest $2 million in repairs for Hiram Bithorn Stadium but said his efforts were opposed by the league and Romero. Romero said at a news conference this month introducing Impulse Sports and Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee as the Cangrejeros’ operators that the team would remain at Hiram Bithorn Stadium and that upgrades were being made at the facility. The Cangrejeros have employed some of the best players in baseball history, including Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, Willie Mays, Orlando Cepeda, Frank Robinson, Reggie Jackson, Robin Yount and Satchel Paige.

Ricky Martin faces restraining order in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,7/2/22,"A judge has issued a restraining order against Puerto Rican superstar Ricky Martin, police said Saturday.

"US closes in on basketball World Cup, tops Puerto Rico 83-75",No Author,7/2/22,"Justin Jackson scored 26 points, Langston Galloway added 18 and the U.S. men’s basketball team took another step toward qualifying for next year’s World Cup by topping Puerto Rico 83-75 on Friday night. John Jenkins scored 13 for the Americans, who improved to 4-1 in World Cup qualifying from the FIBA Americas region. Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans scored 20 for Puerto Rico (2-3), while Gian Clavell scored 17. Ismael Romero added 15 for Puerto Rico. “It was just a matter of us having the respect for them and the physicality of FIBA basketball and just being prepared for that,” Jackson said. The U.S. closes first-round qualifying play Monday at Cuba. The Americans have already clinched a spot in the second round, as has Puerto Rico. “We have a high-character group that came to work,” U.S. coach Jim Boylen said. “And they were very prideful in everything they did. I’m really thankful for that.” Jordan Bell sent the U.S. into the half with a 42-37 lead by banking in a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer, then had words for the Puerto Rico crowd as he left the floor for intermission. That seemed to fire up the Americans, who came out flying in the third quarter. Galloway hit back-to-back 3s for a nine-point lead early in the quarter, and then Jackson took over. He scored nine consecutive U.S. points, that run ending when Cook connected on a deep 3-pointer from the left wing with 2:49 left for a 63-46 lead. Puerto Rico chipped away, but the Americans still carried a 15-point lead into the final quarter after another beat-the-clock score — Eric Mika’s tip-in as time expired in the third for a 66-51 edge. The Americans kept the lead the rest of the way. Alvarado made a 3-pointer with 14 seconds left to get Puerto Rico within 81-75, but the outcome was already decided. “Regardless of the outcome, this is a special moment in my life, for my family and the guys that have the jersey on with me,” Alvarado said. “We’re making memories, we’re growing together and we’ve got a country on our side. We’re going to represent as best as we can. I know we didn’t win today but this is the beginning of a great start.” The records from the first round carry over to the second round, composed of six more games starting in August. Only Canada (5-0) and Brazil (5-0), who are playing in other first-round groups, have better records than the U.S.  The Americas Region will see 12 teams make the second round of qualifying, and of those, seven will play in the World Cup — the main qualifier for the 2024 Paris Olympics. CANADA 95, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 75 At Hamilton, Ontario, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 of his 32 points in the third quarter to lead Canada to an easy win.

Puerto Rico board approves budget as legislators quibble,DÁNICA COTO,7/1/22,"The federal control board that oversees the finances of Puerto Rico’s government approved a $12.4 billion general fund budget Thursday for the U.S. territory after legislators failed to approve one amid intense bickering. The board’s version of the budget was rejected last month by Gov. Pedro Pierluisi because it reduced government spending by $100 million. He said at the time that legislators would submit their own version, but the presidents of the island’s Senate and House of Representatives clashed and failed to approve anything before the July 1 deadline. “It’s unfortunate that the legislative process tied to the central government’s budget was very controversial and took too long,” Pierluisi said in a statement. He said lawmakers wasted an opportunity to include things that would be beneficial for Puerto Ricans, noting that while the board included some public policies he had insisted on, “certainly other important ones are missing.” The island’s House of Representatives was scheduled to meet Thursday evening to try and approve another version of the budget, but the board already certified its version. The overall $28 billion budget included the $12.4 billion general fund for day to day expenses as well as federal funding and money from a fund for specific uses. The overall budget includes $5.5 billion for public health, $4.6 billion for education and $1.3 billion “to protect future government pensions from economic uncertainty,” as well as $3.1 billion for families and children, $2.6 billion for pension payments and $1.1 billion for debt related obligations. The budget comes as Puerto Rico’s government emerges from the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history after declaring in 2015 that it could not pay its more than $70 billion public debt, which accumulated through decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing. It also had more than $50 billion in public pension liabilities.  Puerto Rico’s government filed for bankruptcy in 2017, a year after Congress created the financial oversight and management board for the territory. Board chairman David Skeel said the certified budget sets aside more than $700 million in capital expenditures, including more than $170 million for housing and more than $150 million in public works to help revitalize the island’s economy. “After years of deficits that resulted in inadequate funding for critical services, Puerto Rico is now able to provide significant investments to improve the quality of life for Puerto Rico residents and businesses,” he said. The island is still trying to recover from deadly hurricanes and earthquakes in recent years as well as a lengthy economic crisis that deepened amid the pandemic.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-government-spending-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-687a76107f7556de763afcf558c01648

Puerto Rico suspends operations of bank amid global probe,DÁNICA COTO,7/1/22,"Authorities announced Thursday they have suspended the operations of Puerto Rico-based Euro Pacific International Bank, which officials previously said was under suspicion of facilitating money laundering and offshore tax evasion. The bank was founded by Peter Schiff, a U.S. stock broker and financial analyst, and had 15,000 accounts by the end of 2019, according to online documents. The investigation was launched by Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, which said the bank that obtained a license to operate in the U.S. territory in 2017 came under scrutiny following a lack of internal controls, a lack of compliance and a level of insolvency. Commissioner Natalia Zequeira said that despite “numerous opportunities,” the bank “has not wanted to comply.” The bank, located in the capital of San Juan, did not return a message asking for comment. Jim Lee, chief of the International Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, said he could neither confirm nor deny whether Schiff was under investigation. Zequeira declined to say how many clients the bank has and its total assets, saying that is confidential information. However, she said creditors would be paid in a certain order. The bank was formed in the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2011, then later moved to Puerto Rico. In a 2020 presentation, the bank said 70% of its clients were corporations and small- and medium-size businesses. The other 30% was divided equally between individual investors and retail banking. The bank does not provide loans or credit cards, but rather mutual funds and precious metals accounts, among other things. Lee, with the IRS, said that the “Puerto Rico financial industry will not be a haven for tax evaders or illegal conduct.” The announcement of the suspension came after the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement launched an operation two years ago to scrutinize financial institutions in their member countries: the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands. Officials with the agency said their investigations into the Euro Pacific International Bank are independent from the one conducted by Puerto Rico’s government and are still underway. Overall, the organization said, it is overseeing some 100 civil and criminal investigations worldwide. “Our message is that the game is up for offshore tax evaders and that any UK citizens involved with this bank should come and talk to us,” said Simon York, the United Kingdom’s chief in the international group.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-money-laundering-puerto-rico-san-juan-efb421edca78f0d477c665d346658373

Peter Schiff trying to save Puerto Rico bank under probe,DÁNICA COTO,7/1/22,"U.S. financial analyst Peter Schiff told The Associated Press on Friday that he will fight to be able to sell a bank he established in Puerto Rico even though authorities have suspended its operations as part of an investigation. Euro Pacific International Bank obtained a license in 2017 to operate in the U.S. territory and built up some 15,000 accounts two years later, but its deposits have dropped to $150 million and it lost customers after the Joints Chief of Global Tax Enforcement — a multi-government group fighting tax crimes and money laundering — said it acted two years ago “to put a stop to the suspected facilitation of offshore tax evasion and money laundering by the bank.” “We lost a lot of things because people were afraid,” Schiff said. He added that while he doesn’t like anti-money-laundering rules, or regulations or taxes, he does abide by them. “The fact that I’m so willing to publicly criticize rules, you better believe I’m doing all I can not to break them,” he said. The so-called J5 agency, whose members are the U.S., the UK, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, said Thursday that an investigation into the bank is still ongoing, although it declined to provide details. Schiff said that was a lie, that the bank has never been investigated. He said agents with the Internal Revenue Service visited the bank in 2020 and told him they were investigating customers of the bank. “Our compliance is so rigorous, and we close accounts so quickly,” he said, adding that he never took clients related to cryptocurrency, cannabis or other fields. “I did everything by the book, and it cost me a fortune.” A spokeswoman for J5 did not return a message for comment Friday. Schiff said he also was upset that the bank’s operations were suspended by Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, which announced the move on Thursday and accused the bank of a lack of internal controls, a lack of compliance and a level of insolvency. Officials noted it was separate from the J5 probe. “It’s a huge shock that they’ve done this,” Schiff said of the bank’s suspended operations. Schiff said that while he didn’t realize the bank was undercapitalized until it was audited, he stressed it was not a matter of solvency but regulatory minimum capital requirements. He said the bank always has had a positive net worth and that while there was a deficiency based on deposits, the commissioner told him not to worry because a buyer had appeared. Schiff said a Houston-based bank wanted to buy Euro Pacific International Bank and that he submitted an application in January to start the process. “They were going to rename it, rebrand it, so it would no longer have that stigma,” he said. Natalia Zequeira, commissioner for Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, told The Associated Press on Friday that she doesn’t understand why Schiff was surprised by the agency action since the office met with him in October and he signed a consent form to make the changes required. She added that the bank submitted a business plan, capital plan and strategic plan that her office did not approve, and said the bank did not refile those or correct deficiencies. “Surprises like the one Mr. Schiff had yesterday are a result of not reading the fine print of your regulator,” she said. Zequeira said the consent order he signed required changes in management and strategy that did not happen, and that those processes are separate from a change in ownership. “A regulator has the right to request the best of its institution, and just because you filed something doesn’t give you the right to conclude that you’re in compliance,” she said. “Regulators are not babysitters.” The office’s cease-and-desist order stated that the bank had a net loss of nearly $751,000 in 2019 and overall accumulated losses of nearly $4 million. It added that at the end of 2020, the bank had a capital of negative $1.3 million: “As such, the entity is classified as insolvent.” In the first trimester of 2022, the bank had a net loss of nearly $550,000, the order stated. Meanwhile, Schiff said he has invested $7 million of his own money to keep the bank afloat and that all customers can get 100% of their money back. “Right now, not a single customer is in jeopardy,” he said. Zequeira, however, said Schiff’s personal money does not represent the capital of the institution, adding that the financials show “a very high risk” for his clients. The cease-and-desist order also called for a $765,000 penalty to be paid to Puerto Rico’s Treasury Department. Zequeira said an administrative officer is scheduled to hear the case on July 7 and could decide on whether to appoint a new manager or liquidate the bank, adding that Schiff has the right to go to an appeals court if he disagrees.","https://apnews.com/article/crime-caribbean-puerto-rico-peter-schiff-1bc94510a5037b80425d1f76a25071cd

Puerto Rico sets 7th electric rate increase in just a year,No Author,6/29/22,"Officials in Puerto Rico announced another electric rate increase Wednesday, the seventh in a year amid continuing power outages and the U.S. territory’s economic crisis. For a client that consumes 800 kilowatt hours, the new rate will be 33 cents per kwh, compared with the previous 29 cents. The average U.S. electric rate is 14 cents per kwh, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The rate increase will go into effect Friday, angering many on the island of 3.2 million people who just deal with constant power outages blamed on crumbling infrastructure due to lack of maintenance. In April, a fire at a main power plant sparked an islandwide blackout. The increase comes as crews begin rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power grid that Hurricane Maria razed in September 2017, leavig some customers without power for up to a year. The electric rate increases have occurred since Luma, a private company, took over transmission and distribution a year ago from Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is burdened with $9 billion in debt and is trying to emerge from bankruptcy. Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau said it would revise the electric rate by or before Oct. 1 amid concerns that the newest increase would spook potential investors already wary about the state of the island’s electric grid. Puerto Rico’s power plants depend on petroleum to generate about 97% of electricity, with renewables generating roughly 3%. The government has pledged to lessen its dependence on fossil fuels in upcoming years.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-power-outages-puerto-rico-edf798f90ba5c7e0344b1ad6f379e687

Officials said the plants were nearly six feet (two meters) tall, and that additional marijuana had been packed and was ready for distribution. They said they also found weapons at the site.

27 Haitians rescued from uninhabited Puerto Rico island,No Author,6/22/22,"The U.S. Coast Guard said Wednesday that it recently rescued 27 Haitian migrants from the rocky cliffs of an uninhabited island that lies between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The two-day rescue operation began on June 7 after the Coast Guard said it detected an illegal smuggling boat near Puerto Rico’s Monito Island. Officials said they arrested three illegal smugglers and rescued nine of 27 Haitians who jumped into the water upon seeing the Coast Guard. The agency said dangerous conditions prevented it from rescuing the remaining Haitians, adding that it left food, water and other supplies for them until it returned the next day to rescue the remaining 18 Haitians. The rescue occurred almost a week before funerals were held in Puerto Rico for 11 Haitian women who died after an overloaded boat they and other migrants were on capsized near the U.S. territory last month. Authorities believe between 60 and 75 migrants were onboard, with 38 rescued and 11 dead. The Coast Guard said it has intervened in 64 illegal smuggling voyages from Oct. 1 to May 31, adding that more than 1,200 migrants from the Dominican Republic and 370 Haitians have been detained. The agency said the number of Haitians detained in the past year has spiked compared with previous years. Haiti is currently wracked by an increase in gang-related violence with kidnappings and killings on the rise as a growing number of people flee the country of more than 11 million in search of a better and safer life.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-haiti-dominican-republic-puerto-rico-smuggling-dd4333797f3ac1ef869cdd1945d9c655

Puerto Rico law to boost private sector worker benefits,DÁNICA COTO,6/20/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor signed legislation Monday that will award more rights to private sector workers in the U.S. territory as he defied a federal control board that said the move would be considered a violation of a federal statute. “This new law makes it more attractive and safer to enter the workforce at a time when the vast majority of companies are looking for employees, and when we need more workers to advance the reconstruction of Puerto Rico,” Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said, referring to the island’s struggle to recover from Hurricane Maria and recent earthquakes. The measure increases private sector worker benefits and time off, including for those who only work part-time, and reinstates protections against unjustified dismissals. Vacations for full-time employees will increase to 1.25 days per month, while part-time workers will for the first time receive half-a-day per month for vacation and one day for sickness.  In addition, the accumulated work hours to be eligible for a traditional Christmas bonus are reduced from 1,350 hours to 700 hours at big employers and to 900 hours for small- and medium-size enterprises.  The probationary period for new employees is reduced to three months and overtime in excess of 10 hours is to be paid double time in flexitime agreements or time-and-a-half if there is no flexitime agreement. In signing the legislation, Pierluisi challenged the federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances that had warned it would hurt the island’s economy as it tries to emerge from the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  On June 13, the board issued a letter threatening that it had the power to prevent the governor from signing the bill into law and that if approved, it would be considered a violation of a federal statute. “I completely reject the board’s habitual encroachment on our elected officials’ constitutional duty to set and determine Puerto Rico’s public policy,” the governor wrote in a letter he sent Monday to the board’s chairman. Pierluisi argued the the legislation will increase labor force participation and improve Puerto Rico’s economy. The board has warned it would worsen the 38% labor participation rate on the island of 3.2 million people and deprive it of revenue growth. “I totally disagree,” the governor wrote. “The board has no data to support its assertion.” A spokeswoman for the board said it would review the legislation to ensure it is consistent with the island’s newest fiscal plan, which serves as an economic blueprint.","https://apnews.com/article/politics-caribbean-statutes-puerto-rico-4fcc5fa9b4de8a8b0808920b455df6c6

Haiti mourns 11 women from fatal voyage near Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,6/16/22,"The caskets were rolled in one by one, lined up in front of friends and family who had no idea that many of the 11 Haitian girls and women they were preparing to bury had decided to flee their country. They were teenagers, mothers, students, university graduates, all aboard a grossly overloaded boat that capsized last month in the open waters northwest of Puerto Rico.  It was one of the deadliest voyages in the region in recent months. The boat was carrying an estimated 60 to 75 migrants, of which 11 were found dead, at least a dozen are still missing and 38 were rescued — 36 of them Haitians fleeing a deeply unstable country fighting a surge in poverty and violence. Mourners held aloft their phones at the church and rainy cemetery Wednesday as they live streamed the Mass and burials on social media. They zoomed in on certain caskets for families back in Haiti who couldn’t afford to fly to Puerto Rico and for Haitian migrants living illegally on the U.S. mainland who feared being arrested if they traveled but longed to say goodbye to the victims, including two girls, ages 15 and 16. “Today we bury their remains, but not their lives and hope,” said one of five priests officiating the ceremony as one man attending the service closed his eyes tightly before tears began to form. That man, Pierrot Samedi, lost his 23-year-old sister as well as six cousins on the voyage who were never found. He flew to Puerto Rico from West Palm Beach at the urging of local Haitian leader Leonard Prophil, who helped identify the bodies and who has housed and fed all those who arrived for the funeral. “If you’ve never lived in Haiti, you don’t know what hardship is, you don’t know what misery is,” Prophil said. The country of more than 11 million people is fighting a 180% increase in kidnappings and a 17% rise in homicides in the past year, according to the United Nations. Dozens of people, including women and children, have been killed and raped in recent months as gangs fight over territory and gain more power following the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.  Tens of thousands of Haitians have lost their homes amid gang battles that also have shut down access to the country’s northern and southern regions, the latter still trying to recover from a magnitude 7.2 earthquake last August that killed at least 2,000 people. Haiti’s worsening situation has prompted thousands to flee their country despite the dangers of illegal human smuggling trips that often turn deadly. Some pay to cross the treacherous Mona Passage to reach Puerto Rico from the neighboring Dominican Republic, while others are dropped off in Cuba, the Bahamas or the Turks and Caicos Islands in their quest to reach the U.S. In late May, more than 840 Haitians aboard one boat landed in Cuba, the largest such single arrival in recent history. Meanwhile, hundreds of Haitians have reached Florida in recent months after swimming ashore. U.S. authorities also have reported a big spike in the number of Haitian migrants detained throughout the Caribbean in comparison with previous years. The vast majority of those traveling are men, which makes the death of the 11 women even more unusual. Those mourning them said it’s inevitable that other fatal voyages will occur in upcoming months. “This is not going to end,” said Samedi, who lost seven relatives in the most recent deadly voyage. “It’s not the first one nor will it be the last one.” Most migrants who die at sea and whose bodies are recovered are cremated, but Prophil, the local Haitian leader, said he and others fought for a proper burial because Haitians don’t believe in cremation and the bodies couldn’t be repatriated because of what they criticized as government bureaucracy. They thanked embalmers, funeral homes and a clothing designer in Puerto Rico for donating their time and resources to help the women’s families in what turned out to be a farewell rarely seen after a deadly migrant voyage. Part of Wednesday’s Mass was held in Haitian Creole, with the country’s flag draped over each casket and a framed picture of each girl or woman balanced on it. Some were selfies and others were pictures of them posing, one of them with her hands on her hips, a wide smile and a bright pink scarf tied around her head. Two of the women were 31 years old. One had a son and was studying law and the other was studying accounting. Another victim was a 28-year-old university graduate who had studied business administration and had two sons, family members said. Once at the cemetery, mourners braved heavy rain and stepped through thick, red mud to bury the women as they held each other’s hand, clutched moist tissues or put a palm on the casket before it was lowered into the ground. One woman wailed until others surrounded her and began singing a hymn to calm her. “We’ve been suffering for centuries, and no one has been listening,” said one woman adding that she hasn’t lost hope. “I believe that before I close my eyes, I will see a better Haiti.”","https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-haiti-puerto-rico-2e8a3f6cd48438a7ab47218e19fd0b53

Puerto Rico party to hold vote on its political future,DÁNICA COTO,6/16/22,"With a possible plebiscite on statehood or independence for Puerto Rico looming, one of the island’s two main parties said Thursday it will ask its members to reconsider or reaffirm its own stance on the U.S. territory’s political future by holding an islandwide vote on the issue. The announcement by José Luis Dalmau, president of the Popular Democratic Party, follows a proposal last month by a group of U.S. legislators to hold a binding plebiscite giving Puerto Ricans three options: Become America’s 51st state, become fully independent or opt for independence with free association — possibly maintaining U.S. citizenship and other ties with the U.S.. That vote would not include the possibility of maintaining the current commonwealth status. That choice would appear to threaten the future of Dalmau’s party, founded in the 1930s, which is defined by its support for the current status, under which Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship but the island has quasi-autonomy from the United States. Its main rival, the current governor’s New Progressive Party, advocates for statehood. Possible statehood will not be an option in the PDP’s Aug. 14 vote. Dalmau said the current status and a free association option that he did not define would be offered. Party spokesman Ángel Raúl Matos told The Associated Press that it’s too early to say whether that would be based on the free association option that U.S. lawmakers proposed as one of three choices. Within the Popular Democratic Party, opinions vary as to what sort of commonwealth best suits Puerto Rico. Some argue for closer ties to the U.S. while others seek more independence in some areas. “For decades, this issue has divided us,” Dalmau said. “Since two parallel strategies and two distinct popular parties cannot exist, it’s up to the thousands of (party supporters) to resolve the controversy and make the final decision.” The Popular Democratic Party has roughly 400,000 supporters on the island of 2.3 million people and it got about 32% of the gubernatorial vote in the 2020 election — just behind the New Progressive Party’s 33%. Support for both parties has been eroding due to frustration over corruption scandals, economic problems and mismanagement. Dalmau, who is also the president of Puerto Rico’s Senate, said he would continue to support the island’s current political status, which he said was “the masterpiece of the movement’s founder.” Political analyst Mario Negrón Portillo said Dalmau is likely taking the risk of holding a historic vote because he wants to put an end to the intensifying debate within the party and believes the large majority of its supporters will uphold the status quo. “This is a gamble,” he said. Matos said that on the day of the vote, party officials in each of the island’s 78 municipalities would recognize supporters and allow them to vote. If not, recognized, voters would be asked to fill out a membership statement.","https://apnews.com/article/politics-caribbean-puerto-rico-a11bb996647bd9aa09ffd8b6a3cafa5d

Puerto Rico unveils first power grid reconstruction projects,DÁNICA COTO,6/6/22,"Officials announced Monday that the reconstruction of Puerto Rico’s power grid is finally advancing nearly five years after Hurricane Maria struck the U.S. territory and devastated it. More than $100 million in federal funds were secured for the first 15 of more than 200 reconstruction projects proposed after the Category 4 storm razed the aging power grid in September 2017. A handful of projects were recently completed, including repairs to generation plants. Overall, 216 reconstruction projects are expected to be completed in the next eight years. Until now, only emergency projects had been completed. “This is probably the most important project in Puerto Rico’s modern history,” said José Baquero, federal disaster recovery coordinator for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. In addition, 22,000 streetlights in five of the island’s 78 municipalities will be repaired starting this month. These include Aguada, Guánica, Lajas, Luquillo and Maunabo, which were given priority based on the crime rate, population and tourism of those areas, as well as the condition of street lights there, said Shay Bahramirad, a vice president with Luma, a private company that took over transmission and distribution of Puerto Rico’s power company a year ago. Puerto Rico’s power grid has been struggling with ongoing outages and recent fires and explosions at some substations and reconstruction work coincides with the start of the hurricane season, which is expected to once again be unusually busy. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi warned that the grid might not survive another powerful hurricane in its current state. In April, a fire at a power station sparked an island-wide power outage, with some clients left in the dark for a couple of days. “We recognize that the system is still frail; it’s still outdated,” he said.  Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Company also remains mired in bankruptcy, holding some $9 billion in public debt, the largest of any government agency. While Puerto Rico is emerging from the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history, some debt-restructuring deals, like the one involving the power company, have yet to be completed. Authorities said the reconstruction projects would lessen the frequency of power outages that have frustrated many on the island of 3.2 million people, where many depend on emergency generators. In addition, customers have been hit with several power bill increases in recent months. “We know there is impatience for it to be restructured and improved,” Pierluisi said. “These projects take time because we want to do it well.” Officials said another 21 of the more than 200 reconstruction projects will likely be approved soon by FEMA. Meanwhile, FEMA also is funding $650 million worth of equipment for future projects given current problems securing parts.","https://apnews.com/article/storms-federal-emergency-management-agency-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-c79ce28cdeab57619323919f4c8541fa

Lack of water in Puerto Rico town sparks federal lawsuit,No Author,6/2/22,"Puerto Rico’s water and sewer company was hit by a federal lawsuit on Thursday demanding that it provide services to thousands of residents who lack potable water on a daily basis. The class-action lawsuit was filed by Carmen Maldonado, mayor of the northern town of Morovis, who requested that a judge issue an injunction to force Puerto Rico’s Aqueducts and Sewer Authority to provide immediate service to residents in need. The lawsuit represents nearly 1,600 residents and seeks $1,000 for every day spent without water as compensation, alleging that the lack of water has caused more than $55 billion in damages. Maldonado said daily interruptions in water service have long been a problem in Morovis that grew worse after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm and razed the U.S. territory’s electric grid. The lawsuit states that every day on average at least three wards within the municipality have no water service. It also noted that the town has spent more than $1 million in hiring and deploying water trucks since January 2017. The lawsuit accuses the water and sewer company of blaming the problem on heavy rainfalls, power outages, mechanical failures and other issues. “Every day there is an excuse,” it states, adding that the company has not adjusted the bills and that those suing “have a constitutional right to water service.” Daily power outages remain common across Puerto Rico, with officials saying that if power generators are not working, they are unable to pump water. A spokeswoman for the water and sewer company did not immediately respond to a message for comment.","https://apnews.com/article/politics-caribbean-puerto-rico-lawsuits-6350bfa7f390b902b1f4a0b4a98d4220

Official: 41 indicted in $58M Puerto Rico drug operation,No Author,5/25/22,"A federal grand jury indicted 41 suspected gang members in Puerto Rico accused of smuggling drugs to the U.S mainland as part of a $58 million operation, authorities said Wednesday. Those arrested include several of the U.S. territory’s suspected drug trafficking leaders, according to Joseph González, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Juan. He said the suspects are accused of distributing drugs that arrived via ships from Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said the suspects also are accused of distributing heroin, crack, prescription pills and other drugs near various public housing complexes in the capital of San Juan for the past six years. Three of the 41 suspects are accused of money laundering, including buying cars with revenue from the alleged drug sales. Authorities said the suspects would prepare the drugs in abandoned apartments in public housing units and stash them in properties using rental applications like AirBnb.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-san-juan-puerto-rico-dominican-republic-smuggling-8b4416e6e0556ab149c5445e02d68bb1

Puerto Rico food scene thriving after string of disasters,JOHN MARSHALL,5/23/22,"restaurant owners right there with them. Now, as the pandemic starts to wane, the Puerto Rican food scene is thriving again. “It’s been rocky, but we’re resilient,” said chef Mario Pagán, who owns five restaurants in Puerto Rico. “You can definitely see it coming back around now.” Traditional Puerto Rican cuisine is a blend of African, Spanish and Caribbean flavors, with stews, fish, arroz con pollo, mofongo, sofrito and adobo among the staples. The scene began to expand as young chefs took what they learned from universities and culinary schools to the streets. They put modern spins on traditional Puerto Rican foods, often creating fusions with other types of cuisine, like Asian or Italian. New restaurants spread across the island as locals craved more options, and vacation home rentals gave visitors more choices besides the hotels of San Juan. By 2017, Puerto Rico had more than 5,000 restaurants, from cafeterias and bakeries to fine dining, according to Jose Vazquez, president of the Restaurants Association of Puerto Rico. The restaurant industry is the third-largest on the island — behind manufacturing and tourism — accounting for roughly 60,000 jobs directly, another 40,000 indirectly. About 6% of the gross national product is attributed to restaurant sales. “The culinary industry is part of our culture,” Vazquez said. “People love our food. They fly down here and want to try our local cuisine. It’s very good food.” The first big hit came with Hurricane Maria in 2017. The Category 5 storm devastated the island, flattening buildings, knocking out power and communications, leaving roads impassible, residents without food or water. About 90% of all businesses and restaurants were wiped out. Restaurant owners jumped into action and, with the help of chef José Andrés and food/product supplier Frutos del Guacabo, set up makeshift kitchens that served more than 3.5 million meals as Puerto Ricans tried to get back on their feet. Restaurants slowly began reopening — some scaled down, others in new locations — and by late 2019, there were about 4,000 operating on the island. Then, the earthquakes.  Puerto Rico was hit with a swarm of earthquakes starting that December, the most damaging a magnitude 6.4. The earthquakes centered on southern Puerto Rico, but the effects spread across the island as businesses and schools were closed for weeks. Restaurants on other parts of the island managed to get by, and Fruto del Gaubacho, which supplies roughly 200 restaurants and hotels, worked to get food and supplies to the hard-hit areas in the south. “Each time it’s a different test,” Fruto del Gaubacho co-owner Efrén Robles said. “You learn the test and then they change the answers... We’ve been able to adjust in a very short amount of time.” The learning curve took another sharp turn in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Puerto Rico rebounded from the earthquakes to have some of the best tourism numbers in its history and restaurants were doing well, even during the offseason. The pandemic, as it did around the world, led to shutdowns. More than 1,000 restaurants just in the San Juan area were forced to shutter, but many were able to survive by offering takeout and delivery options. Some created packages for holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Mother’s Day. Because Puerto Rico is a small island, COVID-19 measures were widely enforced, while standards in the rest of the United States often varied from state to state. Restaurants rode the ebbs and flows of the pandemic, some opening at limited capacity by May and expanding from there as restrictions began to loosen. As the pandemic has started to wind down, the restaurant industry has skyrocketed, returning to pre-disaster numbers as lodging in 2021 reached $1.3 billion — 37% higher than the previous record in 2019. “It’s been rocky and pretty hard, but we’re coping,” Pagán said during the Aspen Food & Wine Classic last fall. “It has been one thing after another, but we are very resilient.” And they will be ready for whatever comes next.","https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-travel-chefs-62b061599b39104e88bb9da9eb0a185e

US lawmakers urge binding vote on Puerto Rico status,DÁNICA COTO,5/20/22,"A group of mostly Democratic congress members, including the House majority leader, on Thursday proposed a binding plebiscite to decide whether Puerto Rico should become a state or gain some sort of independence. The draft proposal unveiled at an online news conference would commit Congress to accepting Puerto Rico into the United States if voters on the island approve it. But even if the plan were to pass the Democratic-led House, the proposal appears to have little chance in the Senate, where Republicans have long opposed statehood.  Voters also could choose outright independence or independence with free association, whose terms would be defined following negotiations over foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar, said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida. If no majority emerges, a second round of voting would be held between the top two alternatives. The measure, not yet introduced, follows months of negotiations between federal lawmakers who have long disagreed on what Puerto Rico’s political status should be. “Getting to this point has not been an easy process. Is it perfection? No,” said Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, chairman of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees affairs in U.S. territories.  U.S. House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland said all those involved had to make compromises, but he pledged to push the bill through. The bill has the support of Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico’s congressional representative and a Republican who has limited voting powers. Puerto Rico has held seven unilateral, nonbinding referendums on the issue, but this would be the first that would not include possible continuation of the current status as a U.S. commonwealth. No overwhelming majority for or against statehood emerged in earlier referendums. The last was held during the November 2020 general elections, with 53% of votes for statehood and 47% against, with only a little more than half of registered voters participating. As a U.S. territory, Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship but are not allowed to vote in general elections; they have a congressional representative with limited voting powers, and they receive less money from certain federal programs than do people in U.S. states. “Nobody can deny that the current status of Puerto Rico is undemocratic,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, whose New Progressive Party has long pushed for the island to become the 51st U.S. state. The main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo, rejected the proposed plebiscite because it does not include Puerto Rico’s current political status.  “This project excludes those who think differently,” said party president José Luis Dalmau, who is also president of Puerto Rico’s Senate and vowed to fight the proposal. “This is a lack of respect.” Meanwhile, backers said the next step is to hold public hearings in Puerto Rico on the proposed bill prior to its introduction. If eventually approved, Pierluisi said the plebiscite would be held on Nov. 5, 2023. The proposal comes at a time when Puerto Rico is trying to emerge from a lengthy bankruptcy and recover from the devastation left by Hurricane Maria in 2017. There is also growing discontent with Puerto Rico’s two main parties and ongoing government corruption scandals. The November 2020 elections were the first time that the territory’s two main parties failed to reach 40% of votes. Pierluisi won with only 33% of votes. “I know we are all skeptical because of the political dynamics in Puerto Rico,” said U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez of New York, who supports the new proposal.","https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-united-states-puerto-rico-caribbean-darren-soto-da9e2464614ab69fcc3a01f0465833ca

Coast Guard ends search after rescuing 38 near Puerto Rico,No Author,5/16/22,"The U.S. Coast Guard announced Monday that it suspended the search for potential survivors of a capsized boat near Puerto Rico after finding 11 bodies and rescuing 38 migrants from a vessel that had carried an estimated 60 to 75 passengers. Crews searched the waters north of uninhabited Desecheo Island, which lies west of Puerto Rico, for four days. All 11 victims were Haitian women and 36 of the 38 survivors were Haitians. The remaining two were from the Dominican Republic, officials said. “Our most heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who did not survive or remain missing,” said Capt. Gregory Magee, commander of the San Juan Coast Guard sector. “These crews have done their utmost to ensure that if there were any more survivors, that they would have had the best chance to be rescued.” Federal authorities announced Monday that they filed charges against Fermín Montilla, a 43-year-old man from the Dominican Republic accused of smuggling Haitian migrants aboard the boat that capsized. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.  Rescue efforts began on Thursday after a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter spotted the capsized boat while on patrol. Authorities have reported a big increase in recent months in the number of Haitian migrants fleeing their country, which is struggling with a spike in brutal gang violence, political instability and a crumbling economy.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-dominican-republic-puerto-rico-san-juan-us-coast-guard-f23c52037d7eb6971ebb6e2219ad28d6

"11 dead, 31 rescued after boat capsizes near Puerto Rico",DÁNICA COTO,5/13/22,"A boat loaded with suspected migrants capsized north of an uninhabited island near Puerto Rico and 11 people had been confirmed dead while 31 others were rescued Thursday, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people were aboard the boat when it turned over, said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad. He said a “mass rescue effort” was still underway. “We’re looking to rescue as many people as we can and find as many survivors as we can,” he said. At least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital, although the nationalities of all those aboard the boat were not immediately known. The incident was the latest in a string of capsizings across the region as migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty in their countries. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter spotted the overturned boat late Thursday morning. “If not for that, we would not have known about this until someone would have found any sign or received reports from people that their loved ones are missing,” Castrodad said. “They found them early enough that we were able to coordinate a response.” The boat was spotted more than 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the uninhabited island of Desecheo, which is off Puerto Rico’s west coast. The U.S. Coast Guard said those rescued were 20 men and 11 women.  The capsizing comes less than a week after the U.S. Coast Guard and Dominican navy on Saturday rescued 68 migrants in the Mona Passage, a treacherous area between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. One woman believed to be from Haiti died, Castrodad said. “These voyages are dangerous,” Castrodad said. “They’re unsafe, they are grossly overloaded ... (and) no lifesaving equipment. It wouldn’t really take much for any of these vessels to capsize.” From October 2021 to March, 571 Haitians and 252 people from the Dominican Republic were detained in waters around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The majority of those Haitians, 348 of them, landed in Puerto Rico’s uninhabited Mona Island and were rescued. In fiscal year 2021, 310 Haitians and 354 Dominicans were detained, compared with the 22 Haitians and 313 Dominicans apprehended in fiscal year 2020. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard said that in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, it apprehended 1,527 Haitians, 838 Cubans and 742 people from the Dominican Republic in the region, which includes Florida and the Caribbean. Since then, trips of human smuggling boats have only increased, authorities say. In January, the Coast Guard searched for at least 38 people missing off Florida’s coast after a suspected human smuggling boat that had left the Bahamas capsized in a storm. A sole survivor was reported. Hundreds of Haitians have arrived in Florida alone in recent months after swimming ashore.  Haiti is struggling with a surge in gang-related violence that has killed dozens of people, including women and children, and caused thousands of families to flee their homes. Kidnappings also have spiked, including those of eight Turkish citizens who on Sunday were forced off a bus they had boarded in the Dominican Republic.  Kidnappings in the country of more than 11 million people have increased 180% and homicides are up 17% in the past year, according to the United Nations, which last week expressed concern over “the rapid deterioration of security and human rights” in Haiti. Many have criticized the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden for deporting more than 20,000 Haitians in recent months given the country’s deepening turmoil.","https://apnews.com/article/immigration-puerto-rico-0e1f67149a9fbce830a5a5860cbbe48e

Puerto Rico governor rejects budget in new clash with board,DÁNICA COTO,5/12/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Thursday that he was rejecting a proposed $12.4 billion budget filed by a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances and would submit his own version as the U.S. territory emerges from bankruptcy. The announcement is the latest clash between the board and Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who criticized it for insisting on reducing government costs by nearly $100 million. “We’re not going to give up in our fight,” he said. Pierluisi said estimated future collections are high enough to offset government costs and that he would submit a separate budget on Friday. A spokeswoman for the board said there would be no immediate reaction.  The budget that the board submitted to legislators on Wednesday would have been the first balanced one since Puerto Rico filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history after announcing in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load. The debt was accumulated through decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing. The board noted that its proposed budget dedicates almost 70% of revenue to education, public safety, health, pensions and economic development. It also contains pay increases for public workers that have long demanded them. “The budget is consistent with Puerto Rico’s path to fiscal responsibility and provides the government with the stability that is critical in this time of global economic uncertainty,” said board chairman David Skeel. The board has stressed that it will remain in place by law until four consecutive budgets are approved.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-e3ae2960e8b4b8584d1a9142e23d4ab7

U.S. DOJ says two mayors in Puerto Rico arrested and charged with taking bribes,Kanishka Singh,5/6/22," The mayors of two municipalities in Puerto Rico were arrested on public corruption charges, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday, confirming an earlier media report that caused Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to demand for their resignations.

Puerto Rico teachers fail to overturn pension changes in debt plan,Maria Chutchian,4/27/22," A federal appeals court has upheld modifications to teachers’ pensions under Puerto Rico’s debt adjustment plan despite arguments from teachers’ associations that the changes violate commonwealth law. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday said that the federal law that authorized the commonwealth's debt restructuring allowed a federally appointed oversight board to modify the pension obligations. The changes were part of the board's wideranging restructuring for Puerto Rico, which was approved by a lower court in  January  after nearly five years in a bankruptcylike process known as Title III. The Title III cases were filed to address the commonwealth’s $135 billion in liabilities, which included $55 billion in underfunded pension obligations. An attorney for the teachers associations, Jessica Méndez Colberg of Bufete Emmanuelli, called the decision ""unfortunate."" ""The case reinforces the powers of the oversight board over the government of Puerto Rico and the people of Puerto Rico and highlights, yet again, the consequences of Puerto Rico being a colony of the Unites States,"" she said. Under the plan, which went into effect in March, government retirees’ existing pension benefits that had already accrued remain intact. But teachers’ associations in Puerto Rico opposed the plan on the grounds that it freezes definedbenefit retirement programs that cover active teachers and judges and replaces them with definedcontribution plans and enrollment in social security. The teachers’ associations appealed Chief U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain’s approval of the plan in February, arguing that the modifications to pension benefits violated existing Puerto Rico laws that created the definedbenefit plans years ago. They asserted that the laws entitling them to pension benefits have not been revoked by the legislature and are still in effect. But the panel rejected that stance, finding that even though the legislature has not revoked those laws, the oversight board’s authority under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act to guide the commonwealth’s future fiscal practices trumps conflicting commonwealth law. “Given this context, it would make little sense for the Board to have no ability to restrict accruals under the very pension payment regime that helped create the crisis in the first place,” U.S. Circuit Judge William Kayatta wrote in Tuesday's decision on behalf of a threejudge panel. The panel, which also included U.S. Circuit Judges O. Rogeriee Thompson and Jeffrey Howard, also rejected the associations’ contention that the debt adjustment plan’s pension modifications can’t be enacted without legislation, saying there is no such requirement that legislation be passed for every component of the plan. The case is Financial Oversight Board of Puerto Rico v Federacion de Maestros de Puerto Rico, 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 221080.

U.S. Supreme Court allows Puerto Rico's exclusion from welfare program,Lawrence Hurley,4/21/22," The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a bid to extend a federal program offering benefits to lowincome elderly, blind and disabled people to residents of Puerto Rico, finding that Congress had the authority to prevent those living in the American territory from receiving the assistance. The justices ruled 81 in favor of President Joe Biden's administration, reversing a lower court's ruling that a 1972 decision by Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program violated a U.S. Constitution requirement that laws apply equally to everyone. The ruling denies the welfare benefits to an estimated 300,000 people on the Caribbean island who otherwise might qualify. The federal government has said an expansion covering Puerto Rico would have cost $2 billion a year. ""Enough of this colonial status that discriminates against us and affects our quality of life. The only and the best solution is statehood,"" Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's prostatehood governor, said in a statement. Puerto Rico's status is a divisive issue on the island, with some favoring remaining a territory while others push for statehood or even independence from the United States. The ruling, authored by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, found that Congress acted validly under a constitutional provision letting lawmakers treat territories differently than states. Kavanaugh said a ruling extending benefits to Puerto Rico could have ""farreaching consequences"" inflicting additional financial burdens on its residents  including that they be required to pay federal income tax, which they do not currently do. ""The Constitution does not require that extreme outcome,"" Kavanaugh wrote. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, was the sole dissenter. Sotomayor pointed out that as the island does not have voting representation in Congress, its people cannot rely on Congress to recognize their rights. ""Equal treatment of citizens should not be left to the vagaries of the political process,"" Sotomayor wrote. A provision extending SSI benefits to Puerto Rico is part of Democraticbacked social spending legislation that has stalled in Congress. 'A DEVASTATING DAY' Jose Luis Vaello Madero, the disabled 67yearold man at the center of the case, received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. The U.S. government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for SSI payments he received after moving to Puerto Rico. ""It is unfortunate the court failed to see the discrimination faced by the most needy Puerto Rican Americans whose only distinguishing feature is that they choose to remain in Puerto Rico, their home on U.S. soil. This is a devastating day for Mr. Vaello Madero and for Puerto Rico,"" said Hermann Ferre, Vaello Madero's lawyer. The Justice Department declined comment. Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the mostpopulous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people. SSI benefits are available to American citizens living in all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. The Supreme Court has been instrumental in defining the legal status of Puerto Ricans dating to a series of rulings starting more than a century ago called the Insular Cases, some suffused with racist language. Those rulings endorsed the notion that the people of newly acquired U.S. territories could receive different treatment than citizens living in U.S. states. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch in a separate opinion said the court in a future case should overturn the Insular Cases, saying they ""rest on racial stereotypes"" and ""deserve no place in our law."" Congress decided not to include Puerto Rico when it enacted the SSI program. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different benefits program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding. The government's appeal originally was filed by former President Donald Trump's administration. Biden's administration continued the appeal while also urging Congress to extend SSI to Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico Olympian’s mother killed at home by stray bullet,DAVE COLLINS,4/12/22,"The mother of a Puerto Rican Olympian was killed by a stray bullet while sewing in her Connecticut home over the weekend, according to the athlete and police. Police believe Mabel Martinez, 56, was an innocent bystander and the intended target was apparently a man walking outside her home in the town of Waterbury. He was wounded in the leg and survived. No arrests have been announced. Mabel Martinez was the mother of Yarimar Mercado Martinez, a rifle shooter on the Puerto Rico Olympic team who competed in the summer Olympics last year and in 2016. Mabel Martinez died Sunday after being shot in the head Saturday afternoon, police said.  Mercado Martinez, 27, expressed her anguish in social media posts. “Why you? Why this way? You were just sitting in your little house sewing, as you always did,” she wrote in Spanish. “Two days ago you called me with excitement, asking me to save the date and help you prepare to renew your wedding vows with daddy in Puerto Rico,” she said Sunday. “There are so many things I still needed to learn from you ... I was so far away without being able to do anything, I couldn’t even say goodbye to you.” She wrote that the family intends to bring her mother’s body to Puerto Rico “so her friends and family can say goodbye.” “I apologize to Puerto Rico because even if I wanted to, I really can’t compete, my place is with my family,” she wrote. A message seeking comment was left Monday for Mercado Martinez. The athlete flew out of Brazil late Sunday and has arrived in Connecticut, according to Gilberto Hernández, president of the Puerto Rico Shooting Association, the sport’s governing body in the U.S. territory. Hernández said it’s not clear when the body would arrive for burial in Puerto Rico, adding that the shooting association is helping pay a portion of the funeral costs. “We trust that she will overcome this,” he told The Associated Press. “She can count on us. ... The doors of the association are always open.” Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said investigators believe the shooting was drug-related and had nothing to do with Mabel Martinez. “This was definitely a random, tragic act of violence,” he told the AP. “She was in her house. She’s not the intended target.” Spagnolo said relatives were extremely distraught, including Mabel Martinez’s husband, whom he described as inconsolable. He said the investigation has been “very, very active” since Saturday. ___ AP journalist Dánica Coto contributed to this report from San Juan, Puerto Rico.","https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-business-sports-puerto-rico-olympic-team-39b870737726adcf743b9e51ecb01e5c

Power restored in Puerto Rico nearly 5 days after blackout,DÁNICA COTO,4/11/22,"A private company announced Monday that power had been fully restored to Puerto Rico’s almost 1.5 million customers nearly five days after a fire at a main power plant sparked an island-wide blackout and prompted public schools and government agencies to close. Officials are now focused on investigating what exactly caused the failure of a circuit breaker at a substation within the Costa Sur power plant in southern Puerto Rico, one of four main plants in the U.S. territory. “I know many in Puerto Rico are asking, ‘How is it that this happened?’” said Wayne Stensby, CEO of Luma, a company that took over transmission and distribution for the Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority last year. “There’s no question the electricity grid in Puerto Rico is incredibly fragile.” The blackout outraged and worried many on the island of 3.2 million people, including those who cannot afford generators and have medical conditions including diabetes and respiratory issues that depend on electricity for their treatments.  The outage snarled traffic, shuttered businesses and forced some people to sleep outdoors given the heat. Customers angry over the extended outage noted they have been hit with recent increases in their power bills, and people complained the blackout damaged electrical appliances and forced them to throw out groceries as the island struggles to emerge from a more than decade-long economic crisis. Gary Soto, director of Luma project system operations, said another outage occurred just days after the blackout that affected 25% of customers due to a new failure at another power plant involving a boiler that crews had recently repaired. Shay Bahramirad, an engineering vice president, said a third party will look into the failure of the circuit breaker, noting that the blackout occurred 19 seconds after the initial fault was recorded. She said equipment at the power plant where the fire occurred dates from 1969 to the mid-1970s, although she declined to provide details including maintenance records on the failed circuit breaker, saying it would be taken out of context. It was not immediately known what maintenance, if any, Luma had performed on the circuit breaker once it took over operations of Puerto Rico’s transmission and distribution last June. When asked several times whether maintenance on the circuit breaker was delayed, the company’s CEO said, “We are not going to speculate.” Stensby said independent third parties would be responsible for the investigation and the structural testing and engineering design to rebuild the damaged area.  The outage comes as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Company tries to emerge from a bankruptcy-like process and restructure some $9 billion in debt. The utility has long struggled with corruption, mismanagement and a lack of investment in the electric grid, which Hurricane Maria razed in 2017. Emergency repairs were made at the time, but reconstruction projects have yet to start. In addition, a series of strong earthquakes that hit southern Puerto Rico in late 2019 and early 2020 damaged the Costa Sur plant and other infrastructure. Prior to Hurricane Maria, a fire at another power plant sparked an island-wide blackout in September 2016. A large fire in June last year at a substation in the capital of San Juan left hundreds of thousands of clients without power.","https://apnews.com/article/business-san-juan-puerto-rico-fires-3c00707d8efc4cc7ef716d3155266020

Puerto Rico struggles to emerge from outage as anger builds,DÁNICA COTO,4/8/22,"Shuttered businesses. Sleepless nights. Canceled classes. Hundreds of thousands of people across Puerto Rico remained without power on Friday, nearly two days after a fire at a main power plant sparked an island-wide outage. Crews have restored power to some 650,000 customers out of nearly 1.5 million, but people in several neighborhoods have complained that the electricity went out once again as the island struggles to emerge from the blackout that also left more than 160,000 clients without water. The outage forced the government to cancel classes and shutter agencies for the second day in a row on this U.S. territory of 3.2 million people as frustration and anger bubbled over. “This is unbearable,” said Maribel Hernández, 49, as she wiped her forehead with a small blue washcloth that she hung over her left shoulder. Hernández, who is recovering from cancer, has been sleeping on the concrete floor in her home’s narrow outdoor patio with only a sheet because her mattress doesn’t fit there. She worries about being mugged because she lives in a working-class neighborhood with a high crime rate, but the heat inside her house is overwhelming. “Those who have generators are doing well, but what about people like us?” she said, adding that she’s been forced to throw out all her food. Officials with Luma, which took over transmission and distribution from Puerto Rico’s Electric Power company last year, have said they don’t know exactly when power would be fully restored but note crews have been working nonstop. “The system is extremely fragile,” said Shay Bahramirad, an engineering vice president with Luma. Hours later, dozens of angry protesters marched in front of the company’s headquarters, throwing eggs at the front door and dropping off bags of room-temperature chicken, cheese and ground meat. The company has said that a circuit-breaker failure could have caused the blackout after a fire erupted late Wednesday at the Costa Sur power plant in southern Puerto Rico, but that it will be weeks before they’ll know the exact cause of the interruption. Meanwhile, the lack of power prompted at least one city to distribute food to the elderly and ice to those with health conditions including diabetes as many wonder when exactly they’ll have lights again. “I haven’t slept,” said Fernando García, a 51-year-old construction worker who is more worried about not being able to find work in the past two days given the outage. “I don’t have a budget right now.” García stood outside a small outdoor cafeteria selling eggs and greasy turnovers known as empanadillas, grateful that the owner allowed him to charge his phone for the day as he continued to look for work. Luma CEO Wayne Stensby has called the outage “very unusual” and said it demonstrated the fragility of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, which Hurricane Maria razed in 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. Emergency repairs were made at the time, but reconstruction efforts have yet to start on the crumbling electrical grid that has caused weekly outages in dozens of communities  Late Thursday, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said it had approved nearly $9.5 billion to Puerto Rico’s power company in September 2020 to rebuild the grid, but that it has not yet received any transmission and distribution projects for evaluation and approval of construction funds. In addition, the Costa Sur generation plant, one of four main ones on the island, was damaged during a series of strong earthquakes that struck southern Puerto Rico in recent years. Kevin Acevedo, a vice president for Luma, said Friday that the company hopes to have restored power to 1 million customers by late Friday night. Those who have power back said they are relieved but worry about the impact the outage had on shrinking budgets already hard hit by the island’s more than decade-long economic crisis. Felicia Serrano, manager of a small grocery store in a community called Barrio Obrero in the capital of San Juan, said she lost $2,000 worth of merchandise as a result of the blackout. The store runs on a small generator that keeps the lights on but doesn’t have the power to keep large refrigerators running. “Ýou’re working under a lot of stress when you have no lights,” she said as she grabbed large bunches of green plantains and placed them on worn shelves. Many are now worried about the state of the electrical grid just two months before the Atlantic Hurricane season starts. Josué Colón, executive director of Puerto Rico’s power company, said those concerns are legitimate: “It’s still a system that is not in prime condition. It’s still a system that has to be rebuilt.” The outage comes as Puerto Rico’s electric power company tries to emerge from bankruptcy and restructure some $9 billion in public debt. The company has long struggled with corruption, mismanagement and a lack of investment into aging infrastructure.","https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-san-juan-puerto-rico-fires-fade8a02da091a9dbc43573d627515d7

"Major outage forces Puerto Rico to shutter schools, offices",DÁNICA COTO,4/8/22,"More than a million customers in Puerto Rico remained without electricity on Thursday after a fire at a main power plant caused the biggest blackout so far this year across the U.S. territory, forcing it to cancel classes and shutter government offices. The blackout also left nearly 170,000 customers without water, forced authorities to close some main roads and snarled traffic elsewhere across the island of 3.2 million people, where the roar of generators and smell of diesel filled the air. “We urge you to stay home if possible,” said Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Domingo Emanuelli, who is serving as interim governor since Gov. Pedro Pierluisi is on an official trip in Spain. Those who could not afford generators and have medical conditions such as diabetes, which depends on refrigerated insulin, worried about how much longer they’d be without power. Owners of shuttered businesses also wondered when they could reopen. Long lines formed at some gas stations as people sought fuel for generators. Others tried to charge their cellphones at businesses in scenes reminiscent of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which struck as a Category 4 storm in 2017. Frustration and anger grew throughout the day as officials warned the outage could stretch into Friday. “No one can say exactly when” power would be fully restored, said Kevin Acevedo, a vice president of Luma, the company that took over transmission and distribution from Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority last year. “We have to be realistic. The system is complex, delicate.”  As of late Thursday afternoon, crews had restored power to some 500,000 customers out of nearly 1.5 million. Officials in at least one city distributed food to hundreds of elderly people as well as ice to those whose medication must be kept cool. “This is horrible,” said Luisa Rosado, a mother of two who lives in the San Juan neighborhood of Río Piedras. She said she and her husband had sacrificed their savings to install a solar electricity system at their home after Hurricane Maria, which left them with at least partial power following the blackout. She said her neighbors had been outraged by recent increases in power bills, which were already higher than in most U.S. states. “To increase bills when you don’t provide a perfect service ... the level of impunity is absurd,” Rosado said. Luma said the blackout could have been caused by a circuit-breaker failure at the Costa Sur generation plant — one of four main plants on the island. But company officials said the exact cause of the interruption is unknown. “It’s going to require an exhaustive investigation,” Acevedo said, adding that that the equipment whose failure sparked the fire had been properly maintained. Officials said at least three generation units were back online by Thursday, with crews working to restore more. Luma CEO Wayne Stensby called it a “very unusual” outage that “clearly indicates the fragility of the system.” The outage occurred two months before the Atlantic hurricane season starts, worrying many about the condition of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid. “Yes, the system is fragile, no one is denying that, but we’re prepared,” Acevedo said. Police officers were stationed at main intersections to help direct traffic on Thursday while health officials checked in at hospitals to ensure generators were still running. The outage further enraged Puerto Ricans already frustrated with an electricity system razed by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Emergency repairs were made at the time, but reconstruction efforts have not yet started, and power company officials blame aging, ill-maintained infrastructure for the ongoing outages. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said late Thursday that it approved nearly $9.5B to Puerto Rico’s power company in September 2020 to rebuild the island’s electrical grid, but that it has yet to receive any transmission and distribution projects for evaluation and approval of construction funds. A series of strong earthquakes that struck southern Puerto Rico where the Costa Sur plant is located also had damaged it. The Electric Power Authority also is trying to restructure $9 billion worth of public debt to emerge from a lengthy bankruptcy. The company has struggled for decades with corruption, mismanagement and a lack of maintenance. In June last year, a large fire at a substation in the capital of San Juan left hundreds of thousands without power. Another fire at a power plant in September 2016 sparked an island-wide blackout.","https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-san-juan-puerto-rico-fires-7239c6a0679779daf7845d1d46d24ba2

A third of Puerto Rico remains in the dark for the second day,Reuters,4/8/22," More than a third of all homes and businesses in Puerto Rico remained without power on Friday, the second day of a massive outage on the Caribbean island that may have been caused by a fire at a power plant. Some 500,000 of the 1.4 million homes and businesses in the U.S. territory were without power, according to a PowerOutage.US tally. The outage forced public schools to cancel classes for the second day and some courts to suspend work on Friday. Some 162,000 customers, out of a total of 1.3 million, were without drinking water service due to the blackout, media reported on the island. ""7 am on Friday and we are still without power in Laguna Gardens. I officially lost all my food, couldn't work, and what little hope I had turned to courage,"" said a Twitter user who goes by the name of Nicole Shantei, referring to a neighborhood in San Juan. Puerto Rico's LUMA Energy reported late on Thursday that work to restore power for 380,000 customers was expected well into Friday, given the massive size and scope of the outage. ""We continue to work hard to restart generation units and high voltage lines,"" it said. The exact cause of the islandwide power outage was unknown, LUMA said, but a failed circuit breaker at Costa Sur power plant may be to blame. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority posted a video on Twitter of a fire at the plant in Guayanilla, a town in southwest Puerto Rico, on Wednesday night. Hurricane Maria, which wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico in 2018, exposed the fragile state of the electrical grid on the island of 3.3 million people.

Puerto Rico plunged into darkness after power station fire,DÁNICA COTO,4/7/22,"A major power outage hit Puerto Rico late Wednesday, plunging hundreds of thousands of customers into darkness after a fire erupted at one of the largest power plants in the U.S. territory. The outage was one of the biggest in recent months for the island’s crumbling electrical grid, which has seen its periodic blackouts grow worse the last few years. The outage elicited a collective groan across the island of 3.2 million people, with many who depend on insulin or respiratory therapies once again worried about how long it would last. “Apagón!” wrote many frustrated customers across social media, using the Spanish word for outage. Luma, a private company that took over transmission and distribution of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority last year, called it an island-wide power outage. However, the state power company’s website said nearly 350,000 clients out of nearly 1.5 million were without lights. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said priority would be given to hospitals and other institutions as he tweeted: “I urge everyone to remain calm.” Puerto Rico’s health secretary said generators at all hospitals and health centers were functioning and had enough fuel, adding that coronavirus vaccines remained properly stored at the correct temperature.  Transportation officials said crews evacuated passengers from the island’s rapid transit system and took them to their destinations via buses. Meanwhile, long lines formed at some gas stations as those with generators sought to refill them. Education officials said they would soon announce whether classes at public schools would be cancelled Thursday, frustrating many parents who worried they might not find out if their cellphones died and they were unable to charge them. Luma said in a statement that power might not be restored until Thursday, “given the size and scope” of the outage. “The power grid has suffered a massive island-wide blackout, potentially caused by a circuit breaker failure at the Costa Sur generation plant. We are not clear on the exact cause at this time,” the company said. Costa Sur is one of the island’s four main power plants. Puerto Rico’s fire department worked late into the night to put out the blaze as frustration and anger over yet another blackout continued to grow. Carian Montull, 36, said she was at a clothing store in southern Puerto Rico when the lights went out. She said the store’s generators failed to turn on, so she and about a dozen other customers were forced to leave their purchases behind and go home. She said someone nearby cried out: “The lights seriously went out?! It can’t be.” Montull said she doesn’t have a generator at home and hoped the power would come back soon so the food in her refrigerator wouldn’t spoil. Luma said it would release additional information once it had more details. When it took over transmission and distribution in June, the governor at the time said the company had pledged to reduce power interruptions by 30% and the length of outages by 40%. That same month, a large fire at a substation in the capital of San Juan left hundreds of thousands without power. Another fire at a power plant in September 2016 sparked an island-wide blackout. A year later, Hurricane Maria hit, razing the island’s frail electrical grid and leaving some customers without power for nearly a year. Emergency repairs have since been made, but reconstruction efforts have yet to start. In addition, Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority is trying to emerge from bankruptcy and holds some $9 billion in public debt that it is trying to restructure. The utility has long struggled with mismanagement, corruption and aging infrastructure that has not been maintained.","https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-puerto-rico-san-juan-power-outages-58b8a7a059b3a1f0c65fe25083d949cd

Puerto Rico steps into abortion restriction debate,DÁNICA COTO,4/7/22,"Powerful lawmakers in Puerto Rico are joining conservatives in states across the U.S. mainland in attempting to set tighter restrictions on abortions, alarming feminist groups and others on the island. A recently introduced bill would prohibit abortions starting at 22 weeks, or when a doctor determines that a fetus is viable, with the sole exception being if a woman’s life is in danger. That is roughly in line with most U.S. state laws, though more limiting than Puerto Rico’s current status, which sets no term limit. The move comes at a time when a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court has many speculating that it may reverse or weaken the constitutional right to abortion recognized under the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. A Puerto Rico Senate committee approved the bill last week in a 9-3 vote despite objections from the island’s health and justice departments. The health secretary said the measure interferes with the patient-doctor relationship and doesn’t take into account circumstances that affect women’s health and access to abortion services. The justice secretary objected to the bill’s call for a government registry of those who terminate pregnancies and the reasons behind it, which he said could endanger patients’ right to privacy. Feminist groups and others also complained of a lack of public hearings before the bill was approved. Some were further angered when José Luis Dalmau, president of Puerto Rico’s Senate and the opposition Popular Democratic Party, said last week that those who abort a viable fetus are “murderers.” His speech brought criticism from former governors of his own party, which has long been considered more liberal than the New Progressive Party of Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. While many polls show majority support for abortion rights in many or most cases on the U.S. mainland, there are signs the opposite is true in Puerto Rico: Recent polls are scarce, but a 2017 survey by Pew Research found that about three quarters of people in Puerto Rico opposed abortion in all or most cases — a far higher percentage than among Puerto Ricans living on the U.S. mainland. Smaller, more recent surveys by local media organizations suggest public opinion hasn’t swayed much. And key politicians from Puerto Rico’s two main parties seem to see advantages in appealing to anti-abortion beliefs. Raúl Cotto-Sierra, a political philosophy professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said both the Popular Democratic Party and the New Progressive Party are trying to regain conservative supporters they lost in the recent election to newer parties such as Project Dignity, which ran on a Christian platform and vowed to implement abortion restrictions. Sen. Joanne Rodríguez Veve, a member of that party, is one of the authors of the current abortion bill. Joining her are Dalmau and Sen. Thomas Rivera Schatz, a former Senate president who is a member of the New Progressive Party. If Puerto Rico lawmakers approve the bill, they would join a growing trend of U.S. states restricting abortions. Forty-four U.S. states have imposed a threshold on abortions — many at fetal viability or in a range of 20 to 24 weeks. And last year, 19 states enacted more than 100 abortion restrictions, the highest total in any year since the Roe v. Wade ruling, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based research organization that supports abortion rights. The most recent occurred Tuesday, when the Republican-controlled House of Oklahoma approved a bill that makes performing an abortion in most circumstances a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Puerto Rico’s Senate had been expected to vote Monday on the bill, but instead kicked it back to the Committee on Life and Family Affairs following criticism about the lack of public hearings. Rodríguez, one of the senators who authored the bill, oversees that committee. “This is a real threat that we’re facing,” said attorney Amárilis Pagán, executive director of Mother Project, a nonprofit group focused on helping women. “We have to align forces so we can fight this.” The committee is expected to hold public hearings this month and send it to the Senate for a vote. If it passes, it would go to the House of Representatives. Sens. Dalmau, Rivera and Rodríguez released a joint statement implying they don’t expect hearings to sway positions: “Some believe or imply that holding public hearings would change the minds of those who favor or those who oppose the measure. Time will tell.” Their supporters include the activist group Women for Puerto Rico, which said the bill could help boost the island’s dwindling birth rate and argued that fetuses at 23 weeks have survived. The territory of 3.2 million people recorded a total of more than 3,700 abortions in 2020, a drop from the 4,200 reported in 2018, according to the latest government statistics. Health officials say about 99% of abortions in Puerto Rico are done before 22 weeks. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi has not joined the debate, saying only he favors public hearings “so that we can obtain input from all parties, including medical criteria. We must be careful in this matter, and it must depend on the greatest amount of analysis possible.”","https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-caribbean-puerto-rico-cd8ce1e0f0f4b9e0551c07aa8c6b71fa

Massive power outage leaves a third of Puerto Rico in the dark,Reuters,4/7/22," Crews in Puerto Rico worked to restore electricity to almost a third of the island on Thursday as utility officials tried to pinpoint the exact cause of the massive outage on the Caribbean island, saying a fire at a power plant may be responsible. Some 400,000 of the 1.4 million homes and businesses in the U.S. territory were without power on Thursday morning, according to a Reuters tally.

Puerto Rico exits bankruptcy after grueling debt negotiation,DÁNICA COTO,3/15/22,"Puerto Rico’s government formally exited bankruptcy Tuesday, completing the largest public debt restructuring in U.S. history after announcing nearly seven years ago that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion debt. The exit means that the U.S. Caribbean territory’s government will resume billion-dollar payments to bondholders for the first time in several years, settle some $1 billion worth of claims filed by residents and local businesses and issue more than $10 billion worth of bonds. The government also will restore up to $1.3 billion taken from a public pension system. “This is a significant success,” said Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances and its debt restructuring process. “Remaining in bankruptcy has been a drag on the economy in multiple ways.” The bankruptcy led to widely criticized austerity measures on an island that paid some $1 billion in fees to consultants and lawyers and in other expenses during the process.  The exit was a priority for the board and Jaresko, who previously announced she is retiring April 1. A replacement has not been named yet. The board is expected to remain in place until Puerto Rico has four consecutive balanced budgets, a feat that has yet to be achieved. The debt restructuring plan was approved by a federal judge in January. It reduces claims against Puerto Rico’s government from $33 billion to just over $7.4 billion, with 7 cents of every taxpayer dollar going to debt service, compared with 25 cents previously. “This is a transcendental moment,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “The plan is not perfect ... but it has a lot of good things.” The board has clashed several times with Pierluisi and previous administrations, particularly on a proposal to reduce certain monthly pension benefits that was ultimately scrapped. The plan also creates a public pension reserve trust that will be funded with more than $10 billion in upcoming years. “For decades, past governments have neglected to put aside enough money,” Jaresko said. While many celebrated Puerto Rico’s exit from bankruptcy, Jaresko said it is unlikely the island will be able to access financial markets soon because it has yet to get its audited financial statements up to date. Puerto Rico accumulated more than $70 billion in public debt and more than $50 billion in public pension liabilities through decades of corruption, mismanagement and excessive borrowing. The U.S. Congress created the federal board in 2016, a year after the island’s government said it was unable to pay its debt. In 2017, Puerto Rico’s government filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S history. Months later, Hurricane Maria struck, razing the island’s power grid and causing billions of dollars in damage. The island is still trying to recover from the hurricane as well as a series of powerful earthquakes that struck its southern region starting in late 2019. The coronavirus pandemic also has been a serious setback. Still unresolved are the bankruptcy proceedings for the $5.8 billion in debt held by Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority and the Electric Power Company, which owes $9 billion, the largest debt of any government agency.  In early March, Puerto Rico’s governor announced he was canceling a debt restructuring deal for the power company, saying that worsening inflation, surging oil prices and other factors had changed significantly since the deal was negotiated with creditors in 2019. Jarekso said the board expects to soon renew negotiations, mediation and discussion with all those who bought bonds issued by the power company.","https://apnews.com/article/business-puerto-rico-economy-f59ac458d3d007e05716d9302b069ca5

"Puerto Rico exits bankruptcy, but work remains",Maria Chutchian,3/15/22," Puerto Rico will formally end its bankruptcy on Tuesday as the federally appointed financial oversight board implements key provisions of the commonwealth’s debt adjustment plan, including the establishment of a pension reserve trust and the exchange of existing bonds for new debt. An emergence from bankruptcy has been a long time coming for Puerto Rico, which has been in a bankruptcylike process known as Title III since May 2017. In January, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain  approved  a $135 billion debt adjustment plan. On Tuesday, the financial transactions outlined in that plan, including approximately $10 billion in settlements with creditors, will go into effect, the oversight board said on Monday. That amount includes $7.2 billion for general obligation bondholders, $1.4 billion for public employees' retirement accounts, and $200 million for general unsecured creditors, according to the board. The plan reduces $33 billion in bond debt to $7 billion and cuts overall debt by around 75%. It includes protections that limit how much debt Puerto Rico can take on in the future. The plan also slashes the commonwealth’s annual debt service to around $1.5 billion from $3.9 billion previously. Puerto Rico had not made a payment on its general obligation bond debt since early 2016. But that plan only addresses the commonwealth’s own debt. Billions more owed by Puerto Rico’s electric power authority and its transportation authority remain outstanding. Both of those public entities are still in the process of their own, separate Title III cases before Swain. Natalie Jaresko, the oversight board’s executive director, said during a press conference to discuss the plan's implementation on Monday that the board is still working to file a debt adjustment plan for the transportation authority this spring. The electric power authority, however, recently saw Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi  back out  of its $8 billion restructuring proposal. Swain has instructed the parties to come up with a new plan quickly or face a potential dismissal of the case. Jaresko said the board is looking to renew negotiations with interested parties, which includes bondholders, fuel line lenders and the electric authority's pension system, among others. Jaresko is slated to step down from her position on April 1. Board chairman David Skeel said on Monday that the board is in the process of finding a replacement. The case is In re Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, No. 1704780.

Vatican replaces Puerto Rico bishop who alleges persecution ,DÁNICA COTO,3/9/22,"The bishop of the Arecibo diocese in Puerto Rico said Wednesday that the Vatican dismissed him against his wishes, a rare move for the Holy See.  The announcement comes nearly a year after Monsignor Daniel Fernández declined to sign a decree issued by the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference declaring that unvaccinated parishioners would be separated from vaccinated ones during activities including the presentation of bread and wine at the altar. The Episcopal Conference also suggested that unvaccinated parishioners avoid other in-person church activities until further notice. “We’re taking this measure for your own safety, and for that of priests, religious people and also relatives and parishioners,” the Aug. 24, 2021, decree stated. Days before the decree was signed, Fernández issued a statement noting, among other things, that “it is legitimate for a faithful Catholic to have doubts about the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.” Pope Francis has been a vigorous champion of vaccines, describing them as a way to protect others as well as oneself against COVID-19. Fernández did not specify the reason for his substitution in a lengthy statement but said that he felt “blessed to suffer persecution and slander,” adding that “God is my judge.” He said he was never formally accused of anything nor faced any kind of process. Fernández added that he was informed that he had not committed any crime but that he allegedly “had not been obedient to the Pope nor had he had sufficient communion with my brother bishops of Puerto Rico.” A spokesman for the Vatican did not respond to a request for comment, while a spokeswoman for the Arecibo Diocese declined comment. The office of Puerto Rico’s archbishop issued a statement calling the dismissal “painful news” and urged people to pray, while the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference said in a statement that it was “such a painful moment” for the Arecibo diocese.  “Out of deference and respect for the internal canonical processes of the Church, these will be the only official expressions that will be made,” it said. Fernández said that a person he did not identify suggested that if he resigned, he would remain at the service of the Catholic Church if they needed him for anything. He declined. “I did not resign because I did not want to become an accomplice in a completely unjust action,” he wrote, adding: “I express my communion in the Catholic faith, with the Pope and my brothers in the episcopate, despite my perplexity at an incomprehensible arbitrariness.” Fernández had served as bishop for nearly 12 years. The Vatican said it had appointed an apostolic administrator from the same diocese, Monsignor Álvaro Corrada del Río, retired bishop of Mayaguez, to replace Fernández.","https://apnews.com/article/health-religion-puerto-rico-6593163326d0d057b00ff85727ad39c1

Judge orders speedy revamp of Puerto Rico power authority debt plan,Maria Chutchian,3/9/22," The federally appointed board overseeing the bankruptcy of Puerto Rico’s electric power authority must submit a new debt adjustment plan quickly after an existing agreement to restructure more than $8 billion in debt was axed by the island’s governor on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain instructed the oversight board on Tuesday to develop a plan, or a detailed plan outline, by May 2. Swain indicated that she may consider dismissing the power authority’s entire courtsupervised bankruptcylike process, known as Title III, as well, for failing to show that a feasible plan can be put together in a timely fashion. The power authority, known as PREPA, filed for Title III protection in 2017 alongside the commonwealth itself. Swain  approved  the commonwealth's separate $135 billion restructuring plan in January. In 2019, PREPA and the board cinched a  restructuring deal with a group of PREPA bondholders, including BlackRock Financial Management, that would reduce the utility’s debt by up to 32.5%. It would have required new legislation to issue new bonds that would be backed by new charges to PREPA customers. Governor Pedro Pierluisi's decision to back out of the agreement on Tuesday followed longstanding opposition to such legislation by lawmakers. Pierluisi said on Tuesday that he hopes to work toward a new agreement that, among other things, does not impose charges on private power generation. After the governor terminated the deal, Swain issued an order instructing the board, the government, the bondholders and other interested parties to discuss the possibility of entering mediation. She also stated that if the board is not able to develop a plan or detailed outline of a plan by May 2, it must either submit a detailed schedule to litigate outstanding issues or explain why she shouldn’t dismiss the case outright. The termination of PREPA's restructuring deal ""presents the risk of a major setback in progress toward readjustment of PREPA's liabilities,"" Swain said. A spokesperson for the board said on Wednesday that it is reviewing the judge’s order and will respond as instructed. A lawyer for the bondholder group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is In re Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, No. 1704780.

Puerto Rico to lift mask mandate as COVID-19 cases ease,DÁNICA COTO,3/7/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Monday that he is ending a requirement for mask use indoors for the second time since the pandemic began as the number of cases and hospitalizations ease. The change will take effect Thursday with a few exceptions. Face masks will still be required in health facilities and nursing homes. In addition, starting March 10, domestic travelers will no longer have to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test or fill out a currently required form. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi also will lift all capacity restrictions at public and private businesses and said proof of vaccination to enter will no longer be required. He added that vaccination requirements for people including public school students, restaurant employees and health workers will be lifted. Puerto Rico’s Scientific Coalition, a group of experts appointed by the governor to advise him during the pandemic, said it agreed with some of the measures announced but said the vaccine mandates for certain groups and proof of vaccination for events of 1,000 people or more should be kept in place. It also advised that masks should be worn in enclosed places that serve the public such as airports, buses and others. “We’re still facing uncertain scenarios in the context of variants,” said Dr. Iris Cardona, a coalition member. The U.S. territory of 3.2 million people has reported a 4% positivity rate, a significant drop from the nearly 40% reported during the holiday season. Pierluisi said more than 95% of people in Puerto Rico have received a first vaccine dose, 86% a second dose, and more than 50% a booster shot. The island has reported more than 267,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19.","https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-pandemics-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-896e92b5d2a69af38cff41427c784d86

Arrest of longtime Canadian fugitive stuns Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,3/4/22,"Last week, phones across Puerto Rico began to ring as members of a private WhatsApp group dedicated to helping others in the U.S. territory stared at their screens in disbelief. The businessman they knew as administrator of that chat — someone who organized philanthropic efforts such as a Christmas toy drive for needy children and renovations for an elementary school — had just been arrested.  Conor Vincent D’Monte, who went by Johnny Williams in Puerto Rico, was allegedly a leader of a violent gang sought by Canadian authorities on charges including first-degree murder. He had been on the run for more than a decade. “It’s like a Netflix story,” said Antonio Torres, chief deputy U.S. marshal for the district of Puerto Rico. Authorities don’t know exactly when D’Monte, 44, arrived in Puerto Rico, but they believe he had been using the alias “Johnny Williams” for a while. The 6-foot, 1-inch fugitive settled into a rural, eastern mountain community near El Yunque rainforest, living in a working-class neighborhood on a street with no name, Torres said. Every month, D’Monte would accompany employees of a nonprofit organization known as Karma Honey Project to a farmer’s market in the nearby city of Carolina, said a woman who lived in the same community and sold goods next to his stall. She declined to give her name out of fear. “No one knew anything,” she said, adding that she remembers his quiet demeanor the most. “We were surprised.” Others who met D’Monte said they were struck by his charisma, good looks and biological knowledge about bees, adding that he was a frequent name-dropper who easily made connections with Puerto Rico’s wealthiest residents. He didn’t like having his picture taken but didn’t make any effort to hide.  He even met with Puerto Rico’s agriculture secretary and a local senator and was invited to the governor’s mansion last month for his role in trying to save honeybees after Hurricane Maria as part of his involvement with the Karma Honey Project, a nonprofit company created in February 2019. Its president, Candice Galek, is a Miami entrepreneur and former model. Neither Galek nor her company returned messages for comment. In its 2020 annual report, the most recent one available, the company stated that its volume of business did not exceed $3 million. Its balance sheet reported no assets or liabilities, according to filings with Puerto Rico’s Registry of Corporations and Entities. “The guy fooled us all,” said a Puerto Rican businessman who asked that his name not be used out of fear. He said he met D’Monte in the early days of the pandemic after being added to his WhatsApp group, and that D’Monte was known as “Johnny Teeth,” because his teeth were so white and straight. The businessman described D’Monte as a “tremendous sales guy” who was very jovial. “It struck me that he didn’t have Facebook or any of those things because he truly was a great networker,” the businessman said, adding that D’Monte once called him asking if he could borrow a hammer since he was helping repair a school. When he was working on the Christmas toy drive, D’Monte messaged his WhatsApp group warning they were 500 presents short and that he was “grinding” to get donations as he noted that the prices went up 40% at the toy distributor warehouse: “Caught us off guard. Will figure it out. Universe conspires,” he wrote, adding three different star emojis. D’Monte remains in federal prison in Puerto Rico as he awaits an extradition process. His public defense attorney declined comment, but she noted in a court hearing on Thursday that D’Monte, who has Canadian and Irish citizenship, requested that the consulates of those countries be notified. It’s unclear why D’Monte chose Puerto Rico or if he knew anyone in the U.S. territory. He is accused in the killing of a rival gang member at a Vancouver strip mall in February 2009, at a time when that part of British Columbia was experiencing one of the worst gang violence outbreaks in its history, according to a police statement. D’Monte also is accused of conspiring to murder two alleged rival gang members known as the Bacon Brothers, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The “United Nations” gang that D’Monte allegedly belongs to is considered one of the most powerful ones in British Columbia and is best known for exporting one of the most popular marijuana strains in the U.S. mainland: the B.C. bud. The gang also imported about 100 kilos of cocaine every three months and paid someone to create a personal encrypted phone system for them to prevent police from tapping their phones, said Doug Spencer, a retired detective with Vancouver’s police gang unit who knew D’Monte and described him as “treacherous” and a “very smooth talker.” At its height, the gang had an estimated 200 members, and they often sport tattoos of tigers, dragons and Chinese characters. The gang also imports firearms and other drugs, making millions of dollars a year, said Keiron McConnell, a criminal justice expert and professor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Surrey, British Columbia. “Anyone thinking that Mr. D’Monte was a street corner hustler, it couldn’t be further than the truth,” he said. “Mr. D’Monte was a fairly sophisticated individual.” McConnell said it’s highly unusual for fugitives to be on the run for as long as D’Monte and to successfully assimilate themselves into a community. D’Monte, who police said has traveled to Asia and allegedly is associated with a drug network in Mexico, was last seen in the Vancouver area in January 2011. He then fled to Spain and traveled up to Ireland where he obtained a fake passport, said Spencer, the retired detective. He noted that authorities tried to catch D’Monte by monitoring all calls to his daughter’s phone every year on her birthday, “but that never worked out. That tells you how smart he is. He knows not to do that.” After stopping in Ireland, D’Monte vanished until he reappeared in Puerto Rico more than a decade later. Torres, with the U.S. Marshals Service, said high-profile fugitives often assume the profile of a very wealthy person because they have the means. “It doesn’t raise any red flags,” he said. “It will draw attention, but not suspicion. They just act like a businessman.” Three weeks before federal agents arrested D’Monte, Torres said his agency finally had collected enough information to identify the fugitive, noting they never received any tips. As D’Monte drove through the popular tourist district of Isla Verde on Feb. 25, the agents closed in. “He acted surprised,” Torres said, adding that he didn’t resist arrest. D’Monte was alone, except for a 9mm at his side.","https://apnews.com/article/canada-lifestyle-arrests-philanthropy-puerto-rico-306e9dcd25be61fd913c83d46e981b9f

Protests grow in Puerto Rico amid demands for higher wages,DÁNICA COTO,2/19/22,"Shrill whistles mixed with drums, tambourines and the clacking of spoons on pots as public employees shut down streets in Puerto Rico’s capital Friday to demand better pay and pensions. The crowd shimmied and clapped as demonstrators held up signs reading, “Fair wages now!” It’s a call that has echoed across Puerto Rico in recent weeks as government employees and supporters take to the streets, emboldened by thousands of public school teachers who abandoned classrooms in early February to demand raises and better pensions. Protests have multiplied and the unrest is posing one of the biggest challenges for Gov. Pedro Pierluisi a year into his term.  “The people kicked the U.S. military out of Vieques. They kicked out a governor. We can make this happen,” said Abner Dumey, who teaches history in the northern town of Naranjito. Legislators are the only public workers who have an automatic cost-of-living increase for their salaries. Most of the U.S. territory’s other public employees have not gotten pay raises in more than a decade — sometimes two — as the cost of living has risen and the island has suffered a lengthy economic crisis and a government bankruptcy in the aftermath of deadly hurricanes, earthquakes and the pandemic. Power and water bills are nearly 60% higher in Puerto Rico than the U.S. average. Groceries are 18% more expensive than on the mainland, although health care and housing costs, among others, are lower, according to the island’s Institute of Statistics. Marcia Rivera, an economist and sociologist whose research focuses largely on poverty and inequality, said government workers are grappling with rising prices while getting the same salaries they had in 2008.  “They’re fed up,” she said. Many public employees work one or two additional jobs to make ends meet.  Carlos Javier Vázquez, for one, is a paramedic in the mountain town of Barranquitas, and he also teaches emergency medicine and operates an ambulance company to help support his wife and four children. It’s a life that is exhausting and not sustainable, he said. But with paramedics in Puerto Rico earning a base salary of $1,725 a month, he said he has no choice. “It’s extremely difficult to survive on that.” In an attempt to quell the demonstrations, the governor promised teachers a $1,000 monthly increase just days after 70% of them walked out of their classrooms in protest earlier this month. He expanded the offer to school principals, regional superintendents and others just days later.  Shortly afterward, he promised a $500 monthly increase for firefighters and a 30% raise for paramedics. Pierluisi’s actions only fanned anger among other government employees, with some demanding their own pay increases as others fumed over the governor’s recent comment that no one is forced to become a firefighter or police officer.  A problem is that all those increases promised by Pierluisi rely on federal funds that expire in upcoming years, and many people did not believe the governor when he promised to find local funds to make the increases permanent. That promise also worried economists. Puerto Rican leaders are trying to restructure a $70 billion public debt following decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing that forced the government to declare the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2017, just months before Hurricane Maria battered the island. “It’s highly irresponsible,” said Antonio Fernós, a Puerto Rico economist and university professor who believes the government is unable to make the increases permanent. “It’s Public Finance 101 of what not to do.” Fernós said one of the key things that made the government go bankrupt was to use temporary funding for fixed costs. “They certainly haven’t learned their lesson yet,” he said. “Puerto Rico is the poster child for government finances mismanagement. This is the worst timing for all wage earners.” Rivera, the poverty researcher, agreed, saying no salary increase should be authorized without having a financial policy in place. She added that the governor should not manage affairs by responding to yelling. “He has opened Pandora’s box,” she said. “He cannot meet all the demand that he himself generated.” Pierluisi’s announcement came just weeks after the federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances approved a fiscal plan that contained smaller pay increases for teachers, firefighters and other employees. It said the government’s financial state did not allow for more. The governor has said a new compensation plan will go into effect next year and bring higher wages for thousands of public employees, yet he also says he won’t be able to raise the pay of all public workers. “I obviously cannot please everyone,” he said Wednesday. “That is impossible.” That same day, he announced a 30% pay increase for dispatchers and medical emergency technicians including paramedics. On Thursday, he announced a $500 monthly increase for prison officers. And while economists are warning about the lack of financing, union leaders say the promised increases are only a good first step. They say more is needed and complain that the government is cutting pension benefits and raising the retirement age. Wanda Ramos, a special education teacher in Caguas, said the pension she is to get upon retirement is being cut from $2,400 a month to $960. She said she struggles now after not getting a raise in 12 years. “I can only buy the essentials. I never have a full fridge,” Ramos said, adding that a hefty portion of her salary goes to paying her daughter’s college education. Migdalia Santiago, who is also a special education teacher, said she faces similar struggles. “Pay the lights, you don’t pay water,” she said. Public school teachers in Puerto Rico earn a base salary of $1,750 a month and are demanding a minimum of $3,500. Meanwhile, firefighters earn a base salary of $1,500 a month and are seeking $2,500 and an improved pension plan.  Union leader José Tirado said firefighters previously could retire at age 55 after 30 years of service with up to 75% of their salary. Now, the minimum retirement age is 58 and they get only 33% of their salary, he said. “The quality of life, with those salaries they earn, is a misery,” Tirado said.","https://apnews.com/article/business-puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-709f1a7892a433f7160f2cfbbcfa0750

Puerto Rico to increase teachers’ salaries by $1K a month,DÁNICA COTO,2/7/22,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Monday that all public school teachers will receive a temporary $1,000 monthly salary increase starting in July as he promised to make it permanent. The move comes just days after 70% of teachers left their classrooms and joined a protest to demand higher wages, better pensions and improved working conditions. Another protest is scheduled for later this month. “For years, we’ve truly been waiting for this moment,” said Víctor Bonilla, president of the Puerto Rico Teachers’ Association, which represents some 25,000 teachers. The base salary of public school teachers in Puerto Rico is $1,750 a month, a number that hasn’t budged in 13 years. While some teachers praised Monday’s announcement, union leaders noted that they are still seeking a base salary of $3,500 a month. Giovanna Ostolaza, who teaches 8th and 9th grade English at a school in the capital of San Juan, said it’s very hard to live on a teacher’s salary, especially for those who have families. She also worried that the governor might not come through on his promise to make the increase permanent. “They have to prioritize education,” she said. “These are people essential to society.” Puerto Rico economist José Caraballo-Cueto noted that utilities are nearly 60% more expensive in Puerto Rico than the U.S. average, and groceries are 18% more expensive. However, healthcare and housing costs, among others, are lower in comparison, according to Puerto Rico’s Institute of Statistics. The teachers’ association and others had rejected a smaller wage increase recently approved by a federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances and the U.S. territory’s exit from bankruptcy. Teachers would have seen an average increase of 27% compared with what they made in fiscal year 2019. They would receive half that increase on July 1, with the other half tied to them finishing a payroll and attendance system and providing for student attendance keeping. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he had been looking for alternatives after the board rejected his proposal to increase teachers’ salaries by $1,000 a month. He added that the additional money will come from federal funds, specifically the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund. He said the use of those funds is temporary and will give his administration time to identify recurrent state funds to make the salary increase permanent. Sybaris Morales Paniagua, interim general secretary for the teachers’ association, said they will make sure the increase is made permanent as part of a collective agreement still being negotiated and that they will continue to push for even higher wages. She said in a phone interview that the governor told them he also has identified funds to increase teachers’ defined contribution pension plans.","https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-f3e871cf314f0d794f633b74498447e0

Fast and Ferocious: Inside the lawyering of Puerto Rico’s historic bankruptcy,Jenna Greene,2/7/22," When lawyers from Proskauer Rose began working on the Puerto Rico debt restructuring five years ago and court filings started coming thick and fast, sometimes 25 or 30 lengthy ones each day, litigation department chair Timothy Mungovan likened the firm’s initial procedures to a makeshift life raft. Think of Tom Hanks’ construction of bamboo and debris in the movie “Castaway,” he said. It stayed afloat, but it wasn’t pretty. As the firm found its sea legs representing the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico in the $120 billionplus bankruptcy and hundreds of related disputes, Mungovan said, “We built an ocean liner over time, while we were crossing the ocean.” The proceedings reached an historic turning point on Jan. 18 when U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain approved the largestever U.S. municipal debt restructuring, my colleague Maria Chuchian  reported . The “plan of adjustment” will cut billions from Puerto Rico’s debt, fix its broken pension system and return the commonwealth to balanced budgets. The work isn’t over  the governmentowned electric power company as well as the transit authority are still in bankruptcy, for example  but the biggest fights have now been resolved. I had a chance to catch up with Mungovan to talk about the onceinacareer legal experience, which in its “speed and ferocity” he said felt at times “like the Oklahoma land rush, with cases filed out of nowhere.” To date, Proskauer has billed $219 million for the representation, according to public fee records, with 260 firm lawyers, about onethird of Proskauer’s total headcount, working on the matter. Firm lawyers are charging a flat rate for their work. Initially, it was set at $730 an hour and has since been bumped up to about $830, the records show. For junior associates, that’s pricey. But conversely, the lead Proskauer partners  who in addition to Mungovan include Martin Bienenstock, Brian Rosen, Michael Firestein, Margaret Dale, Michael Mervis, Ehud Barak, Paul Possinger and Jeffrey Levitan  have been working at bargain rates. And given the novelty and complexity of the matter, it doesn’t strike me as work that could be shuffled off in bulk to inexperienced lawyers. Mungovan declined to comment on the fees. The oversight board frames it as money well spent. In a  January 2021 press release , it noted that creditors have filed 172,893 claims totaling roughly $44 trillion and that the legal team had succeeded in eliminating more than $43 trillion worth of them. “The legal expenses incurred are a fraction of the savings that have been achieved and will be achieved in the future through a substantial reduction of debt service payments,” the board said. In an interview, the board’s executive director, Natalie Jaresk, praised the Proskauer team’s “experience, creativity and strategic perspective,” adding that it “always felt like they’re more than lawyers. They’re our partners.” The oversight board was created by the U.S. Congress in 2016 when it enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA. At the time, Puerto Rico was in dire financial straits. It had no cash flow to pay debt service on $75 billion in bonds or to cover unfunded pensions of about $50 billion, and neither did it have the ability to borrow more. The bipartisan, sevenmember oversight board was tasked with making difficult (and often unpopular) decisions to address the commonwealth’s fiscal crisis. Soon after its formation, the board conducted a competitive process for selecting counsel and picked Proskauer from a pool of 48 applicants. O'Neill & Borges serves as local counsel. Mungovan recalled that he and his colleagues at the time recognized it would be “a huge commitment, and one that we knew would take away from our regular practices and everyday work.” They were right, though he said he’s taken pains to continue handling litigation for other clients, “even though Puerto Rico is a fulltime job.” Traditional bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9 wasn’t an option because Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. In place of that protection, the new law created a courtsupervised, bankruptcylike process known as Title III. It’s new legal ground, with no direct case law to guide the way. Mungovan on a Zoom call showed me his bound copy of the 62page PROMESA legislation – “my Bible” – he called it, a rainbow of highlighted text and flagged pages. It strikes me as the litigator’s version of the old curse, “May you live in interesting times.” But the work has also been fascinating. “We had many, many debates internally and with our client and with colleagues representing the (Puerto Rico) government and legislature over how to interpret the statute,” Mungovan said. “It’s never been examined before.” According to Mungovan, work has included more than 100 adversary proceedings, which are separate from the main bankruptcy, and more than 400 contested matters within the main case. Of the matters that have been appealed, he said Proskauer has won 17 cases and lost four, with one split decision. Dozens of other firms have represented stakeholders in the proceedings, notably O’Melveny & Myers as counsel to the governor of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority. In total, the matter has racked up about $1 billion in legal fees to date. It’s also come against the backdrop of a devastating natural disaster, when Hurricane Maria struck in September 2017, as well as the pandemic. One of the things Mungovan said he’s most proud of is that the firm never missed a filing deadline. Normally, of course, that’s not something to brag about. It’s simply expected. But a normal case doesn’t have 60,000 substantive filings and more than 3,300 separate deadlines for pleadings. The firm over time implemented customized software to track deadlines and scheduling. Every day, dozens of Proskauer lawyers get an email – a chart listing what’s due that day and the next, that week, that month, and the following month, including internal deadlines such as when drafts are due for review by the lead partner and client. They also get an email with the daily filings by all parties. With the work now winding down, I asked Mungovan, will it leave a Puerto Ricoshaped hole in his life? He laughed. “The transition downward is normal and natural and good,” he said. “As a litigator and a lawyer, I like new challenges.” Our Standards:  The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/fast-ferocious-inside-lawyering-puerto-ricos-historic-bankruptcy-2022-02-07/,Reuters,Neutral
"MLB umps: West done, Ortiz is 1st staffer from Puerto Rico ",No Author,2/4/22,"Joe West has made it official, retiring from Major League Baseball after umpiring a record 5,460 regular-season games. Roberto Ortiz became the first Puerto Rican-born umpire to join the big league staff in a series of retirements and promotions announced Friday by MLB. “I am honored and blessed to have the privilege of becoming the first Puerto Rican umpire to be hired by MLB,” the 37-year-old Ortiz said. “It fills me with pride to be able to represent my family and my island of Puerto Rico in what I consider the best league in the world.” Longtime umpires Gerry Davis, Kerwin Danley, Brian Gorman and Fieldin Culbreth also have retired. Ben May, Ryan Additon, Sean Barber and John Libka joined Ortiz in promotions to the full-time MLB staff. Laz Díaz, Greg Gibson, Marvin Hudson, Ron Kulpa and Bill Welke were elevated to crew chiefs. The 69-year-old West worked his first big league game on Sept. 14, 1976, at third base in Atlanta when the Braves hosted the Houston Astros. His finale was on Oct. 6, when he worked home plate at Dodger Stadium for the NL wild-card game between Los Angeles and the St. Louis Cardinals. Known as Country Joe, West set the record for regular-season games last May 25, when he worked the plate when the Chicago White Sox hosted the Cardinals. NL umpire Bill Klem had held the record following in a career that spanned 1905-41. Ortiz had worked 411 major league games since 2016 as a call-up ump. He had been a minor league umpire since 2009 and was assigned to Triple-A last year. May, 40, called 650 MLB games as a call-up since 2014. He started in the minors in 2007 and was in Triple-A last season. Additon, 36, worked the plate when Corey Kluber pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees at Texas last May 19. A minor League ump since 2010 and assigned to Triple-A last year, he had called 381 games in the majors. Barber, 36, had called 690 big league games since 2014. He began in the minors in 2006 and was in Triple-A last season. Libka, 34, had worked 371 MLB games since 2017. He started in the minors in 2010 and was in Triple-A last year. Davis worked a combined 5,000 games in the majors, including a record 151 in the postseason to go with 4,849 in the regular season. He had postseason assignments for 24 straight seasons in his 38-year major league career. He turns 69 later this month. Danley, 60, in 2020 became the first African American crew chief in MLB history and was a big league ump for 25 years. In college, he was an All-American at San Diego State and teammate of Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. Gorman, 62, worked three World Series in his 30-year career and represented umps on MLB’s Playing Rules Committee. He is the son of former umpire Tom Gorman.

"US to modernize, speed up work on Puerto Rico power grid",DÁNICA COTO ,2/2/22,"Three federal agencies promised Wednesday to help modernize Puerto Rico’s outage-plagued power grid and speed up efforts to strengthen it more than four years after Hurricane Maria razed it. More than $12 billion in federal recovery funds are available, and a portion of that will help finance dozens of grid modernization projects scheduled to start this year, said the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which signed the agreement with Puerto Rico’s government along with the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Energy. In addition, more than $1.9 billion will be used to improve the island’s power system, including the creation of small and large microgrids with the aim to help lower income households.  Officials said more than 130 projects soon will be in the bidding phase or under construction, including repairs to substations across Puerto Rico, the replacement of thousands of street lights and the creation of an early warning system for dams. The announcement comes as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority struggles to emerge from bankruptcy and restructure some $9 billion in debt as power outages continue to hit the U.S. territory of 3.2 million people, with many worried about the state of the grid four months before the Atlantic hurricane season starts. “It’s very much needed,” said Cathy Kunkel, energy program manager for CAMBIO, a Puerto Rico-based environmental organization. “The electrical system is still very fragile and there are a lot of problems with blackouts.” The agreement signed with the U.S. territory also aims to lessen Puerto Rico’s dependence on petroleum, with the island’s power company slated to sign contracts for at least 2 gigawatts of renewable energy and 1 gigawatt of energy storage projects. Officials said Puerto Rico is finalizing negotiations on several initial projects, including one that would provide 844 megawatts of renewable energy and 220 megawatts of energy storage. The deal also marks the launch of a two-year study funded by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency that will include public participation to help determine the best way for Puerto Rico to reach 40% renewable energy by 2025 and 100% renewable energy by 2050, a priority of the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. Kunkel praised those efforts, adding that her organization commissioned a study that found Puerto Rico can realistically reach 75% renewable energy by 2035. “It’s absolutely feasible,” she said in a phone interview. “It’s a question of politics.” She noted Puerto Rico’s outdated generation system is 97% based on fossil fuels. The deal also calls for the U.S. Energy Department and one of its laboratories to develop a tool ahead of the June 1 start of the hurricane season combining models of Puerto Rico’s electric system and hurricane forecasting to help the island prepare for storms and speed up emergency response, officials said. Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, which hit September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm that damaged or destroyed thousands of homes and led to the deaths of an estimated 2,975 people. It shredded most of the island’s already rickety and aging power grid, leaving some people without electricity for almost a year. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement that the commitments by the federal agencies and the upcoming study mean “2022 will be a year of action to modernize Puerto Rico’s grid and increase energy resilience.”","https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-caribbean-hurricanes-puerto-rico-5fce692e70cb1566f95ca91fd9149e57

U.S. agencies prepared to give Puerto Rico $12 billion to modernize electric grid,Kanishka Singh,2/2/22," The Biden administration and Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi reached a deal on Wednesday to revamp the U.S. territory's outdated electric grid and move it towards renewable energy, securing over $12 billion in federal recovery funds. Three federal agencies  the U.S. Department of Energy, Homeland Security and Housing and Urban Development  said they were prepared to distribute the federal recovery and grid modernization funds for Puerto Rico's energy sector. The three federal agencies added they implemented a memorandum of understanding to align federal investments with local policies to start transition into clean energy, with the goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2050. Puerto Rico filed for protection under a bankruptcylike law, known as Title III, in May 2017.   read more  In January, the judge overseeing Puerto Rico's nearly fiveyearlong debt restructuring process approved a debt adjustment plan that is intended to revitalize the commonwealth's economy and reduce its $135 billion in liabilities. The debt adjustment plan is expected to go into effect by March 15. The oversight board will remain in place until Puerto Rico has had four consecutive years of balanced budgets. Puerto Rico piled up unsustainable levels of debt in the years leading up to 2017. In 2016, the federal government enacted a law which created a process for the territory to restructure its debt.

"Canada hopeful table potato shipments will resume in weeks to Puerto Rico, U.S. mainland",Rod Nickel,1/27/22," Canada is hopeful of resuming shipments of table potatoes from the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI) to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in two weeks, and to the U.S. mainland in the weeks following that, partially resolving a trade dispute, Canadian Agriculture Minister MarieClaude Bibeau said. Bibeau met in Washington on Thursday with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, after shipments of PEI fresh potatoes to the United States halted in November over U.S. concerns about potato wart. Bibeau said Vilsack agreed to ask the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to conduct a risk analysis of PEI potatoes to Puerto Rico within two weeks, and a risk analysis for the mainland United States in the weeks after that. ""It gave us a lot of hope,"" Bibeau told Reuters. ""Considering that our Canadian scientists are so confident (about safety), we think that the American scientists should come to the same conclusion."" Table potatoes are those meant for human consumption without processing. Bibeau said it would take longer to resolve concerns about potatoes for processing and planting. Potato wart can decrease crop yields but poses no threat to human health. Vilsack's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Farmers in tiny PEI this year expected to sell C$120 million ($94.24 million) worth of potatoes, some 300 million pounds, to the United States. But within a week, farmers will begin destroying potatoes to prevent them from rotting, said Greg Donald, general manager of the PEI Potato Board. ""Folks have just been hanging on, hoping that there will be a change in the border situation,"" he said. The United States has not detected potato wart since the 1970s, said Kam Quarles, CEO of the National Potato Council. U.S. East Coast farmers and processors rely on PEI for seed and fresh potatoes, Quarles said. At U.S. coldstorage facilities in the New England region, potato supplies dropped by 29% to 29.2 million pounds over the year through Dec. 31, USDA data shows.

Statue toppled in Puerto Rico before Spanish king’s visit,DÁNICA COTO,1/25/22,"Unknown people toppled a statue of Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in the pre-dawn hours of Monday ahead of a visit of Spain’s King Felipe VI to the U.S. Caribbean territory of Puerto Rico. Col. José Juan García, police commissioner for San Juan, told The Associated Press that officers patrolling the cobblestone streets of the capital’s historic district heard a loud bang at 4:30 a.m. and found the broken statue. “It sounded like an explosion,” he said. The statue was made of melted steel from British cannons and featured the Spanish explorer facing south with his left hand on his hip and right finger pointed toward the first settlement he founded, which was the island’s first Spanish capital and is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The statue also points in the direction of the nearby San Juan Bautista Cathedral that holds Ponce de León’s remains and is a popular tourist spot. Crews in Old San Juan reinstalled the 1,000 plus-pound (589-kilogram) statue a couple hours after the king arrived late Monday afternoon.  A handful of protesters heckled the workers and briefly interrupted their efforts, with some posting signs on the statue’s base, one of which read, “They’re not gods.” Protesters said that they would topple it again and that a Christopher Columbus statue was next. Spain’s legacy is prominent across Puerto Rico, with a main road in San Juan named after Ponce de León and a colossal Columbus statue rising along the island’s northern coast, a 660-ton sculpture that is more than twice the size of the Statue of Liberty without its pedestal. A much smaller Columbus statue stands at the entrance of Old San Juan, just blocks from the one that was toppled. San Juan Mayor Miguel Romero defended the reinstallation in an interview with Telemundo Puerto Rico, saying, “The Spaniards from 500 years ago are not the same ones of today.” He later told reporters after the king arrived: “Freedom of expression is protected, but what cannot be protected is vandalism. I believe vandalism is the most cowardly form of expression.” Two years ago, activists marched through the streets of Old San Juan as they joined a U.S. movement to eradicate symbols of oppression and demanded that Spain’s legacy in Puerto Rico be erased. While some statues have been defaced with graffiti, police said this is the first time such a statue was toppled. The statue was in the Plaza San José, near the second oldest surviving Spanish church in the Americas, whose construction began by 1532 on land donated by Ponce de León and whose base was erected atop an Indigenous settlement. King Felipe was scheduled to meet with Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi and other officials to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the founding of San Juan. Columbus landed in Puerto Rico in 1493 accompanied by Ponce de León, who became the island’s first governor and quelled an uprising by the native Tainos, a subgroup of the Arawak Indians, after forcing them into labor. Puerto Rico remained a Spanish colony until 1898, when Spain transferred the island to the United States at the end of the Spanish-American war.",https://apnews.com/a60473a72a54ab9a2b244108390f18c8,AP,Neutral
Derriban estatua antes de visita de Felipe VI a Puerto Rico,Por DÁNICA COTO,1/25/22,"Personas desconocidas derribaron el lunes una estatua del explorador español Juan Ponce de León en Puerto Rico antes de la visita del rey Felipe VI de España. El coronel José Juan García, comisionado de policía de San Juan, dijo a The Associated Press que los agentes que patrullaban las calles empedradas del distrito histórico de la capital escucharon un fuerte estruendo a las 4:30 de la madrugada y encontraron la estatua rota. “Sonó como una explosión”, indicó. La estatua está hecha de acero fundido de cañones británicos y presentaba al explorador español mirando hacia el sur con la mano izquierda en la cadera y un dedo de la otra mano apuntando hacia el primer asentamiento que fundó, el cual fue la primera capital española de la isla y es un Monumento Histórico Nacional Estadounidense. La estatua también apunta en dirección de la Catedral de San Juan Bautista, la cual tiene los restos de Ponce de León y es un popular sitio turístico. Trabajadores en el Viejo San Juan reinstalaron la estatua de 589 kilogramos (1.000 libras) un par de horas después de la llegada del monarca la tarde del lunes. Un puñado de manifestantes hostigaron a los trabajadores e interrumpieron su labor brevemente, y algunos pusieron letreros en la base de la estatua, uno de los cuales decía: “No son dioses”. Los manifestantes aseguraron que derribarían el monumento nuevamente y que la estatua de Cristóbal Colón sería la siguiente. El legado de España es palpable en todo Puerto Rico, donde la calle principal de San Juan lleva el nombre de Ponce de León y una enorme estatua de Colón se erige junto a la costa norte de la isla, una escultura de 660 toneladas que es más de dos veces más grande que la Estatua de la Libertad sin su pedestal. Una estatua de Colón mucho más pequeña se ubica en la entrada del Viejo San Juan, a unas cuantas cuadras de la que fue derribada. El alcalde de San Juan, Miguel Romero, defendió la reinstalación de la estatua y declaró a Telemundo Puerto Rico que “los españoles de hace 500 años no son los mismos de hoy”. Posteriormente dijo a los reporteros tras la llegada de Felipe que “las opiniones se respetan. Lo que sí no vamos a tolerar es el vandalismo”. Hace dos años, activistas marcharon por las calles del Viejo San Juan como parte de un movimiento en Estados Unidos para erradicar símbolos de opresión y exigieron que el legado español en Puerto Rico fuera eliminado. Si bien algunas estatuas han sido vandalizadas con grafiti, la policía indicó que esta es la primera vez que una es derribada. La estatua estaba ubicada en la Plaza San José, cerca de la segunda iglesia española más antigua en América, cuya construcción inició en 1532 en tierras donadas por Ponce de León y cuya base fue levantada sobre un asentamiento indígena. El rey Felipe VI tenía programada una reunión con el gobernador puertorriqueño Pedro Pierluisi y otros funcionarios para celebrar el 500mo aniversario de la fundación de San Juan. Colón desembarcó en Puerto Rico en 1493 acompañado de Ponce de León, quien se convirtió en el primer gobernador de la isla y sofocó un levantamiento de los nativos taínos tras haberlos esclavizado. Puerto Rico siguió siendo una colonia española hasta 1898, cuando España transfirió la isla a Estados Unidos al final de la guerra hispano-estadounidense.",https://apnews.com/1b2cce6adcba8a3ef693feae03e9ae11,AP,Neutral

US allots $554M for post-Maria repairs in Puerto Rico,No Author,1/24/22,"The U.S. government has allotted more than $554 million to repair some 275 public housing complexes in Puerto Rico that were damaged by Hurricane Maria more than four years ago, officials announced Monday. The money approved by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency also will be used to remove lead and asbestos and repair basketball courts, officials said. Maria was a powerful Category 4 storm that struck in September 2017, razing the U.S. territory’s power grid, destroying and damaging tens of thousands of homes. An estimated 2,975 people died in its aftermath. Officials said more than 4,600 buildings in the public housing complexes will benefit from the funds.

Puerto Rico’s Nieves regains lead at Latin America Amateur,No Author,1/22/22,"Roberto Nieves of Puerto Rico regained the lead Saturday with a fast start and a steady nerve late for a 2-under 70 and a one-shot advantage going into the final round of the Latin America Amateur Championship. At stake for the winner is a spot in the Masters in April and the British Open at St. Andrews in July, along with being exempt into the final stage of U.S. Open qualifying. Nieves had the lead after the first round with a 66, only to fall four shots behind Julian Perico of Peru going into the weekend on the Teeth of the Dog course at Casa de Campo. Perico, who set the 36-hole record at 9-under 135, fell out of contention with an 80. Nieves quickly got into the mix with three birdies in the opening six holes. He started to lose ground with bogeys on the 13th and 16th holes, only to finish with a birdie to reach 7-under 209. Fred Biondi of Brazil, who plays at Florida, started the third round 10 shots out of the lead and posted a 65 to briefly take the lead until Nieves closed with a birdie. Segundo Oliva Pinto (73) and Vicente Marzilio (72), both of Argentina, and Santiago De La Fuentes of Mexico (72) were two shots behind.  “I feel like I did everything pretty solid, took my medicine on the tough holes. It wasn’t easy, every hole was a challenge today,” Nieves said. “It definitely played harder than the last two days. I think I did a good job of keeping the ball in front of me. I left myself in spots where I wouldn’t get a big number.” Biondi made the most of moving day with his eight birdies against a single bogey. The Brazilian tied for sixth at the Latin America Amateur in 2019 when it was at Casa de Campo. “I like this course in multiple ways and I think you can’t really fake it around here. The greens are small and there are a lot of runoffs. It’s always windy,” Biondi said. Perico isn’t the only player who struggled. Abel Gallegos of Argentina, who won the last Latin America Amateur two years ago, shot 78 and fell out of contention in hopes of defending his title. The championship was canceled last year by the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://apnews.com/article/sports-dominican-republic-peru-puerto-rico-masters-golf-tournament-dfa2065f1d9d667daaa57526827d9f7c,AP,Neutral
"Judge signs plan, resolves Puerto Rico bankruptcy battle",DÁNICA COTO,1/19/22,"Puerto Rico’s nearly five-year bankruptcy battle is ending after a federal judge on Tuesday signed a plan that slashes the U.S. territory’s public debt load as part of a restructuring and allows the government to start repaying creditors. The plan marks the largest municipal debt restructuring in U.S. history and was approved following grueling bargaining efforts, heated hearings and multiple delays as the island struggles to recover from deadly hurricanes, earthquakes and a pandemic that deepened its economic crisis. “There has never been a public restructuring like this anywhere in America or in the world,” said David Skeel, chairman of a federal control board appointed to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances that has worked with the judge on the plan. He noted that no bankruptcy mechanisms exist for countries or U.S. states like the one Puerto Rico was granted. “This was an astonishingly complex and large and important bankruptcy,” Skeel said, noting that the island had three times as much debt as Detroit. Puerto Rico’s government declared in 2015 that it could not afford to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load it had accumulated through decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing. It also had more than $50 billion in public pension liabilities. In 2017, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, a year after U.S. congress created the financial oversight and management board for Puerto Rico. The plan that restructures the central government’s debt goes into effect March 15 and could be appealed, although Skeel expected the judge to affirm it. The board said that the plan signed by federal judge Laura Taylor Swain cuts Puerto Rico’s public debt by 80% and saves the island more than $50 billion in debt service payments as some creditors agreed to deep cuts. Board members noted the plan reduces claims against the government from $33 billion to just over $7.4 billion, with 7 cents of every taxpayer dollar going to debt service, compared with the previous 25 cents. “This period of financial crisis is coming to an end,” said Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director. “We have accomplished what many thought impossible.” The plan also avoids proposed pension cuts that had led to heated debates and created a rift between the board and Puerto Rico’s legislature and the island’s governor, which vehemently opposed them. The plan notes that Puerto Rico has sufficient resources to pay the debt through 2034, but critics have said the government does not have the finances required to meet debt service payments and warned of more austerity measures. Jaresko brushed away those concerns, saying that while budgets were cut, there were no layoffs or agencies shut down. “It wasn’t austerity,” she said. “People look at the last five years and think it’s going to continue like that forever, but it doesn’t.” Still pending is the debt restructuring of some government agencies, including that of the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which holds the largest debt. “This one is very important for the economy of Puerto Rico because if it means a rise in energy costs, it makes us less competitive,” said José Caraballo, a Puerto Rico economist and professor. He added that the island likely would be able to access the market in three to five years to issue bonds for capital projects but warned it should avoid repeating past mistakes. “Borrowing is playing with fire,” he said. “You need to have people who know what they’re doing. Otherwise, one can return to this disaster we call a debt crisis.” Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said that while the plan approved Tuesday is not perfect, it represents a big step for the island’s economic recovery.  “We still have a lot of work ahead of us,” he said. José Luis Dalmau, president of Puerto Rico’s senate and a member of the main opposition party, also praised the plan and called it a transcendental step for the island’s economic recovery. “From this moment on, a new page of fiscal responsibility, good governance and unity begins, which will lead to a more prosperous economy, a climate of job creation and greater fiscal stability,” he said. Jaresko noted the plan has guardrails to prevent a repeat of the island’s debt crisis, including allowing long-term borrowing only for capital improvement projects. The board, known as “la junta” in Puerto Rico and reviled by many, expects to be around for at least three more years, or until Puerto Rico has four consecutive balanced budgets, Skeel said. “We will not stay a day longer than our mandate,” Jaresko said. “It is our goal to finish what we were instructed to do by Congress.”",https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-puerto-rico-bcc3dd61544e8b0a401bbd6567c04da6,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico gets green light to end five-year bankruptcy,Maria Chutchian,1/19/22," The judge overseeing Puerto Rico's nearly fiveyearlong debt restructuring process has approved a debt adjustment plan that is intended to revitalize the commonwealth's economy and reduce its $135 billion in liabilities. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain approved the plan in an order filed on Tuesday, bringing nearly half a decade of litigation over Puerto Rico's financial standing to a close and marking a historic moment for the largestever U.S. municipal debt restructuring. Puerto Rico filed for protection under a bankruptcylike law, known as Title III, in May 2017. Its $135 billion in liabilities included more than $55 billion in underfunded pension obligations. The debt adjustment plan, proposed by a federally appointed financial oversight board, incorporates settlements among an array of creditors and aims to encourage new investments to aid the island's economy. The plan reduces $33 billion in bond debt to $7 billion and cuts overall debt by 80%, according to the board. It also includes protections that limit how much debt Puerto Rico can take on in the future. The case has racked up approximately $1 billion in legal fees. Swain noted in Tuesday's decision that the plan has ""broad but not universal support,"" with many public workers and retirees, among others, taking issue with certain aspects. The oversight board has said that under the plan, government retirees are still in line to receive their full pensions at their current levels. The plan freezes definedbenefit retirement programs that cover active teachers and judges and replaces them with defined contribution plans and enrollment in social security. The board said in a statement on Tuesday that it welcomed Swain's decision but that the commonwealth ""needs to continue to reform itself to ensure a prosperous future."" Puerto Rico piled up unsustainable levels of debt in the years leading up to 2017. In 2016, the federal government enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, which created a process for the territory to restructure its debt. The commonwealth's troubles reached new levels just a few months after it filed for Title III protection as Hurricane Maria ravaged the island, killing about 3,000 people. And in 2019, its governor resigned amid protests over a scandal involving offensive chat messages and government corruption that rocked the island. The debt adjustment plan is expected to go into effect by March 15. The oversight board will remain in place until Puerto Rico has had four consecutive years of balanced budgets.

"Puerto Rico battles COVID-19 surge, imposes new measures",No Author,1/4/22,"Puerto Rico on Tuesday imposed new measures to fight a surge in COVID-19 cases that has overwhelmed medical staff in the U.S. territory and led to temporary shortages of testing kits. All private businesses that cater to the public must close from midnight to 5 a.m., no alcohol will be sold during those hours and gatherings of more than 250 people are banned. The measures will remain in place until Jan. 18 and come as the island of 3.3 million people reports a more than 30% positivity rate, the highest since the pandemic began. The government has reported more than 201,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,300 deaths. Officials note that a third of all cases reported since the pandemic began have occurred in the past month, with many linked to a two-day outdoor concert held in December. The number of daily cases per 100,000 reported in Puerto Rico rose from three to 225 in just three weeks, according to statistician Rafael Irizarry. More than 500 people are hospitalized. Almost 85% of people in Puerto Rico have received the first dose and more than 70% have received the second one. However, at least 40% have not received a booster shot. The increase in cases has caused temporary shortages of home testing kits, with people taking to social media to share places where they’ve run out or are still available, while some government-run testing sites have closed early after exhausting testing kits for the day. Meanwhile, the Association of Hospitals of Puerto Rico urged people to stop visiting emergency rooms to request tests because the demand was overwhelming and preventing staff from treating urgent cases. As a result of the spike, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi has ordered all businesses that sell food and drinks to reduce their capacity to 50% indoors and 75% outdoors until Jan. 16. Restaurant employees and those who work in health and education also were ordered to receive their booster shots by Jan. 15, while customers are required to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter any business that sells food or drinks. In addition, the government recently required that all cruise ship passengers who disembark must be fully vaccinated and provide a negative test taken 48 hours prior to arrival, a move that caused several cruise ship companies to cancel visits to Puerto Rico. Last month, Pierluisi announced that all those flying from the U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico must present a negative test taken 48 hours prior regardless of their vaccination status. Passengers lacking a test must take one within 48 hours of arrival or face a heavy fine, while those who are not vaccinated must remain in quarantine for seven days regardless of whether they test negative. On Monday, the University of Puerto Rico, the island’s largest public university, announced it would offer classes online for all of January given the rise in cases.",https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-caribbean-puerto-rico-9dd4776487246a5ecb8cf927ecab26e5,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico mayor, official charged in US corruption case",No Author,12/9/21,"Federal agents arrested the mayor of one of the wealthiest cities in Puerto Rico on corruption charges Thursday, the second such case announced this month. Guaynabo Mayor Ángel Pérez Otero faces three counts, including bribery and extortion. He is accused of regularly accepting payments of $5,000 in exchange for awarding contracts to the owner of a construction company. The indictment alleges that the scheme ran from 2019 to 2021 and accuses the two of meeting in secret places and of using coded text messages. No one answered the phone at his office on Thursday and it was not immediately clear if Pérez had an attorney. He was sworn in as mayor in August 2017 following a special election after the former mayor, Héctor O’Neill, pleaded guilty to sexual harassment, gender violence and violating an ethics law. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said in a statement that he was disappointed and extremely upset about the arrest. He demanded that Pérez resign immediately as mayor and as president of Puerto Rico’s Federation of Mayors. In early December, federal officials announced that former Cataño Mayor Félix Delgado pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery and receive kickbacks after he was accused of awarding 50 contracts worth nearly $10 million to an asphalt company. U.S. Attorney Stephen Muldrow said that Radamés Benítez Cardona, the executive assistant of the mayor of Trujillo Alto, also was arrested on federal charges including bribery and extortion. He said Benítez is accused of receiving a $200,000 advance payment and more than $17,000 a month from a solid waste company in exchange for securing a government contract for them. Benítez pleaded not guilty.

Puerto Rico arrest order against power company CEO in limbo,DÁNICA COTO,11/10/21,"An arrest warrant issued against the CEO of Luma Energy, the company that operates transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, was in limbo late Wednesday amid accusations he did not submit documents sought by legislators. A judge initially ordered the arrest of CEO Wayne Stensby on Wednesday morning because even though he had turned over a majority of documents that the island’s House of Representatives demanded, two requests were still pending. Shortly after the order was issued, Luma submitted additional documents, although it was still not clear whether they contained all the information sought. As a result, Judge Anthony Cuevas Ramos suspended but did not revoke the arrest order as legislators met with the company’s attorneys to go over the newly released documents. Luma had requested more time to turn over the documents, including receipts filed by employees, consultants and contractors and all communications between Stensby and any Puerto Rico government official, including text messages and emails. “The truth is that (they) have had at a minimum 233 days or 5,592 hours to have copied all the information to the any digital format of their choice,” Cuevas wrote in the initial arrest order. “Unjustified delays cannot be sponsored or blessed by this Court. We consider them a mockery to our judicial system.” The judge further wrote: “Nobody is above the Law. NOBODY.” In a statement issued hours after the arrest warrant, Luma said it had complied with all the information requested by the court, saying that it had submitted more than 10,000 pages of documents and that it is committed to being transparent.",https://apnews.com/article/business-puerto-rico-arrests-e6a92a08e42d06218b5556d660f13111,AP,Neutral
Court seems reluctant to sweep Puerto Rico into SSI program ,MARK SHERMAN,11/9/21,"The Supreme Court appeared reluctant Tuesday to rule for a resident of Puerto Rico who claims it’s unconstitutional to be excluded from a welfare program that’s available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The justices acknowledged that the differential treatment of Puerto Ricans might be problematic, but several suggested that it is up to Congress, not the courts, to act. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said there are “compelling policy arguments” for including Puerto Rico in the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides benefits to older, disabled and blind Americans. But Kavanaugh said the court had to confront a provision of the Constitution that allows Congress to treat territories and states differently. The Caribbean island has been a U.S. territory since the Spanish American War in 1898.  Jose Luis Vaello-Madero, the Puerto Rico resident at the center of the case, began receiving SSI payments after he suffered a series of strokes while living in New York.  The payments continued to his bank account in New York even after he moved back to Puerto Rico. When he notified the Social Security Administration, the payments stopped and then the government sued to recover more than $28,000 it said he was not entitled to. Lower courts sided with Vaello-Madero, ruling that the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the SSI program is unconstitutional. In a similar case in Guam, a federal judge ruled recently that residents of that Pacific island also should be able to collect SSI.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico, was the clearest voice in favor of Vaello-Madero. Sotomayor said it seems irrational to treat poor Americans differently based on where they live. “Needy is needy, whether in Puerto Rico or on the mainland,” Sotomayor said. The Justice Department first filed its appeal of a ruling by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals during the Trump administration, but maintained the case even after President Joe Biden took office. The Biden administration has said it supports changing the law to extend SSI payments to Puerto Rico. The proposed Build Back Better bill in the House of Representatives would make residents of U.S. territories eligible for SSI payments. Justice Department lawyer Curtis Gannon said that a pair of 40-year-old Supreme Court decisions already upheld the federal law that created SSI and excluded Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories from it. Congress later added in the Mariana Islands. Herman Ferre, representing Vaello-Madero, said a series of court decisions dating back to 1901 known as the Insular Cases has left Puerto Rico without “a full seat at the table.”  Residents of the island have no vote for president or representation in Congress. They also do not pay federal income tax. Justice Neil Gorsuch said the high court should formally renounce the Insular Cases, which included racist and xenophobic rhetoric about Puerto Ricans. “Why shouldn’t we just admit the Insular Cases were incorrectly decided?” Gorsuch asked. Another case pending in the 1st Circuit could extend other federal welfare benefits to Puerto Rico as well.  A separate program, Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, covers residents of the territories, but it has more stringent eligibility requirements and pays less generous benefits than SSI.",https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-business-congress-puerto-rico-district-of-columbia-11c51e1f5ce5e3ba0191b5742f3b1c70,AP,Neutral
U.S. Supreme Court wrestles with Puerto Rico's exclusion from benefits program,Lawrence Hurley,11/9/21," The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday tackled the question of whether a decision by Congress five decades ago to exclude Puerto Rico from a federal program that provides benefits to lowincome elderly, blind and disabled people was unlawful. Some of the nine justices posed tough questions during arguments in the case to the lawyer for the U.S. government, which has appealed a lower court ruling that Puerto Rico's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program exclusion violated a U.S. Constitution mandate that laws apply equally to everyone. But it remained unclear whether the Supreme Court, which has a 63 conservative majority, ultimately will rule in favor of Puerto Rican resident Jose Luis VaelloMadero, who received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the Caribbean island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the mostpopulous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people. SSI benefits are available to American citizens living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. If VaelloMadero wins, more than 300,000 Puerto Rico residents could become eligible for the benefit at a cost that the U.S. government has estimated at $2 billion annually. The Supreme Court has been instrumental in defining the legal status of Puerto Ricans dating to a series of rulings starting more than a century ago called the Insular Cases, some suffused with racist language. The rulings endorsed the notion that the people of newly acquired U.S. territories could receive different treatment than citizens living in U.S. states. VaelloMadero's case gives the justices  an opportunity to revisit  those rulings. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed interested in doing so. ""Why shouldn't we just admit that the Insular Cases were incorrectly decided?"" Gorsuch asked. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, mentioned the history of Puerto Ricans being treated as secondclass U.S. citizens. ""Puerto Ricans are citizens and the Constitution applies to them. Their needy people are being treated different than the needy people in the 50 states,"" Sotomayor said. The federal government's central argument is that the congressional decision to exclude Puerto Rico was rational based on the fact that Puerto Ricans do not pay many federal taxes, including income tax. Conservative justices wondered about the repercussions of a ruling favoring VaelloMadero including whether other benefits would have to be extended to residents of U.S. territories. Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted that if there was ""equal treatment across the board"" then questions would be raised over whether Puerto Ricans should pay federal income taxes. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said VaelloMadero's lawyer made ""compelling policy arguments"" but noted that a clause of the Constitution specifically allows Congress to treat territories differently than states. Kavanaugh said it is a part of the Constitution that ""people would want to change"" but that it is not the court's role to do that. VaelloMadero is 67 years old and disabled. The government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for SSI payments he received after moving to Puerto Rico. Congress decided not to include Puerto Rico when it enacted the program in 1972. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different government program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding. The appeal originally was filed by Republican former President Donald Trump's administration. His Democratic successor Joe Biden has  continued the appeal  while at the same time urging Congress to extend SSI to Puerto Rico. A provision extending SSI benefits to Puerto Rico is being considered as part of Democraticbacked social spending legislation being crafted in Congress. Enactment of the provision would limit the importance of the Supreme Court's eventual ruling, due by the end of June.

Puerto Rico bankruptcy nears end as debt plan goes up for approval,Maria Chutchian,11/9/21," The federally appointed board tasked with overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcylike process on Monday kicked off a multiday hearing on its proposed plan to restructure the island’s debt and revamp its economy. The financial oversight board is seeking a ruling from U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who sits on both the Manhattan and San Juan federal courts, approving the  plan  at the conclusion of the hearing, which is currently slated to last 10 days. A favorable ruling will allow the board to wrap up the island's Title III process after more than four years of litigation and negotiations with the commonwealth’s government and various groups of creditors, which has resulted in nearly $1 billion in legal fees. Under the proposed plan, Puerto Rico would reduce $33 billion in bonds and other debt to $7.4 billion. Pensions, which have been a controversial topic during the case, will not be cut, according to the board. However, the plan freezes defined benefit plans for current teachers and judges and shifts them to defined contribution pension plans. While the board has struck deals with groups of bondholders and the Puerto Rican government to secure their support for the plan, others remain opposed, including a teachers union and some retail bondholders. The plan approval hearing  almost didn't happen  after the board clashed with the Puerto Rico Senate over a bill that authorizes the issuance of new bonds, but the sides resolved that dispute in late October. When the proceedings resume on Tuesday, Swain will hear from 25 members of the public selected randomly to share their views on the proposed plan. When the case began in May 2017, Puerto Rico had more than $70 billion in debt and $55 billion in pension liabilities. The case is In re Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, No. 1703283.

Report: $12B in hurricane home damage pending in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,11/3/21,"Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused $18.6 billion in damage to housing across Puerto Rico, with only 36% of that damage covered by federal and local government officials some four years later, according to a report released Wednesday by a nonpartisan think tank. The Center for a New Economy, which focuses on Puerto Rico, said in its analysis that $11.87 billion worth of unrepaired damage to homes is pending, a figure that applies only to those who did not have insurance when the storms hit. “Housing is going to be what to a large extent will determine the success or failure of this reconstruction,” said Raúl Santiago Bartolomei, a research associate with the Center. Irma was a Category 5 storm that skirted Puerto Rico’s northeast region in September 2017. Maria pummeled the U.S. territory two weeks later as a Category 4 hurricane. An estimated 2,975 people died in the aftermath of Maria, which also razed the island’s power grid, leaving some people without electricity for up to a year. The center found that the municipalities with the greatest unmet housing needs are the capital of San Juan, the nearby city of Bayamón and the southern coastal city of Ponce, which also is rebuilding from a series of strong earthquakes that hit almost two years ago. In September, Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi estimated that between 8,000 and 15,000 homes still had so-called “blue roofs” — tarps distributed by the government as a temporary fix following the hurricanes. At the time, Pierluisi announced that a further $20 million in federal funds would be used to replace those roofs as well as make other repairs.",https://apnews.com/article/business-storms-hurricanes-think-tanks-puerto-rico-0191b1e618589499fbe5f667e42a5a21,AP,Neutral
Errant monkey captivates crowd in Puerto Rico’s capital,DÁNICA COTO,11/3/21,"With necks craned and eyes shielded from the sun, dozens of people gathered Wednesday around a towering eucalyptus tree in the heart of Puerto Rico’s bustling capital for a most unusual sight: a rhesus macaque monkey on the loose. It was first spotted clinging to the tree’s branches Tuesday morning. Firefighters and other officials struggled to coax the monkey off the tree as the crowd offered suggestions. “Give it some lunch to make it come down!” one man yelled. “It’s too fat to come down!” retorted a woman nearby. “Oh my gosh, it must be scared,” chimed in a third person. When the first call reporting the monkey came in Tuesday morning, Ramón Luis Marcano, a lieutenant with the island’s Department of Natural Resources, did not believe it. The caller reported the animal was in a tree on a busy, three-lane street that crosses the Santurce neighborhood in the capital of San Juan. “And I’m like, ‘Where?’” He went to the scene with doubts, but there it was: a juvenile male rhesus macaque, which is native to south, central and southeast Asia. “This is not normal,” Marcano said on Wednesday as he observed workers from his agency place a ladder between the tree and the rooftop of a nearby apartment and filled a cage with water, oranges and bananas to lure the monkey. But the monkey refused to budge further, moving up and down the tree at times to the delight of the crowd below that included students, security guards and waiters. “Look! Look! It’s moving! There it goes! There it goes!” yelled one woman as she pointed upward. Police directed traffic as drivers slowed down to try to catch a glimpse of the monkey, which remained largely hidden by leaves and branches. Marcano said he has no idea where the monkey came from. Rhesus macaques, often descended from escapees from research projects, have been found on Puerto Rico’s main island and hundreds of them populate Cayo Santiago, a tiny island off Puerto Rico’s southeast coast, where they are allowed to roam free. But they’re very rare in urban areas — let alone on busy streets far from fruit trees and other sources of food. The only food available along that stretch of road where the monkey was located is a high-end food truck park and a handful of small, indoor cafeterias. Rhesus macaques are omnivores and considered one of the least friendly monkeys. They have reddish faces and bottoms and live between 20 to 40 years in captivity. They also can transmit the herpes B virus to humans, who can die from it if they don’t receive immediate treatment. Marcano said that once the monkey is captured, it will be taken to a veterinarian and later placed with other rhesus macaques at the Dr. Juan A. Rivera Zoo in the western city of Mayaguez. The zoo has been the target of recent complaints and demands that it close following allegations of injuries and inhumane killings. Picture and videos of the monkey filled social media, with the animal drawing ever-more attention while staunchly staying in the tree. “I feel bad for it, honestly,” said Stephen Hoppe, a 34-year-old business owner who shot a video of the monkey. “I imagine it’s terrified. ... Everyone is wondering where it came from.”",https://apnews.com/article/oddities-caribbean-trees-animals-puerto-rico-129a9a21d617d42b207cc27e972f5abc,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico media petitions Supreme Court in abuse case,DÁNICA COTO,10/29/21,"Andrea Ruiz went to court three times in one week to seek protection from her estranged boyfriend. She was denied each time and several weeks later, in late April, the 33-year-old clothing store manager was found beaten, strangled, stabbed and burned to death. The incident outraged many in the U.S. territory and prompted journalists to demand recordings of those court proceedings, only to be turned down by local courts. On Friday, they turned to the U.S. Supreme Court for help, arguing the public has a right to know whether the justice system in Puerto Rico is working or if reform is needed. “It’s a basic, fundamental right,” David Schulz, a Yale Law School lecturer serving as counsel in the case, told The Associated Press. “Without access, people can’t have confidence that the courts are doing the right thing.” In its petition, the Association of Puerto Rico Journalists asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its case against the U.S. territory’s government. They raise two questions: whether automatic closure of all domestic violence proceedings and their recordings violates the First Amendment, and whether courts may take such action without first considering the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly and the right to petition the government. Puerto Rico’s Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After Ruiz’s death, the department announced new measures to help prevent a repeat of similar cases, including assigning a prosecutor to accompany a domestic violence victim to certain hearings and organizing workshops for prosecutors. Ruiz was killed months after Puerto Rico’s governor declared a state of emergency in late January over gender violence, with nearly 5,900 cases reported in 2019 and some 5,500 cases last year in the island of 3.3 million people, with only a small percentage resulting in convictions. Miguel Ocasio was charged in Ruiz’s killing shortly after her body was found; a couple of months later, he took his own life while in jail on a $1 million bond. Ruiz’s mother supports the release of audio recordings of the court proceedings involving her daughter, who had to be identified via dental records. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi also supports their release. But Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court ruled in a 5-3 decision that restricting access to all domestic violence proceedings was necessary because otherwise it would prevent future domestic violence victims from seeking protection from a court.  “We all want answers, but in the quest for someone to answer, we cannot allow such a dire precedent,” the majority wrote. Puerto Rico law states that it’s up to a judge to decide who gets to access special domestic violence courtrooms. On the U.S. mainland, the law varies by state.  Attorney Rafelli González-Cotto, who is helping represent the journalists’ association, criticized the decision of Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court. “It’s a lack of respect to the country and to journalists,” he said. “They have the right to know exactly what happened.” He and other attorneys representing the journalists argue in part that there is precedent given a case nearly two decades ago in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled there was a First Amendment right that allowed public access to records from a domestic abuse proceeding. Attorney Edgar Villanueva-Rivera said access to the information journalists are seeking is vital given what has been uncovered so far by local media, including prosecutors acknowledging that a local court was not aware at the time Ruiz sought protection that her ex-boyfriend had previously been charged in the attempted murder of a former partner, a matter that was resolved in an alternate diversion program. Now that the petition has been filed, those including Puerto Rico’s justice secretary and relatives of Ruiz and Ocasio can respond within 30 days, according to Stephen Stich, a Yale Law School lecturer also representing the journalists. After that, it’s up to the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether it will consider the case. The court accepts between 100 and 150 cases of the more than 7,000 it is asked to review annually, according to the federal government.",https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-media-caribbean-puerto-rico-a1b53ef2cc58c837e4dd48b8df8acb42,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico debt-restructuring bill advances amid criticism,DÁNICA COTO,10/27/21,"Puerto Rico’s Senate and House approved a bill Tuesday that would slash the central government’s debt by half but has also sparked protests and led to fiery exchanges between lawmakers and a federal control board that oversees the U.S. territory’s finances. The bill aims to end a bankruptcy-like process that began after Puerto Rico announced in 2015 that it could not pay its more than $70 billion public debt accumulated during decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing. In May 2017, the government filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy ever in the U.S. The bill would allow Puerto Rico to cut its debt by more than $30 billion, issue new debt worth $10 billion and award some $7 billion in cash to bondholders who have not been paid for nearly five years. Critics say Puerto Rico’s government does not have the finances to adhere to the proposed debt service and warned of upcoming austerity measures. However, the bill, which squeaked by in a 14-13 vote in the Senate and later 34-12 in the House, is still in limbo because it does not have the control board’s support, although Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi is in favor of it. “Today we took a step forward toward the end of our government’s bankruptcy and the board’s departure,” he tweeted. One of the biggest points of contention between Puerto Rico’s government and the board was a proposed cut to some public pensions. The government refused to approve a bill that contained any kind of public pension cuts, while the board sought to cut pensions higher than $1,500 a month by 8.5%, a move that would affect some 40,000 retirees.  Some lawmakers also demanded zero cuts to the University of Puerto Rico, the island’s largest public university, and to the island’s 78 municipalities. Two organizations that represent mayors across Puerto Rico warned in a statement that some city and town services still might be cut as a result of the bill. “Municipalities already have made great sacrifices and budgetary adjustments to maintain its services, some with a reduction in hours and others with layoffs,” officials said. The control board issued a brief statement late Tuesday saying only that it would carefully evaluate the measure, though it has said previously that it would not approve of the bill. The impasse between the board and legislators threatens to erase nearly five years of negotiations with bondholders as part of a bankruptcy-like process that has generated nearly $1 billion in earnings for the attorneys involved. It also could expose Puerto Rico to litigations that were temporarily suspended as part of the process and force the government to pay bondholders. Both sides are expected to go into mediation after the federal judge in the case, Laura Taylor Swain, warned Monday that she would not push back the Nov. 8 confirmation hearing on the plan, adding that “my patience is wearing thin.” Puerto Rico Sen. José Antonio Vargas Vidot said it was best to skip the bill and go straight into mediation. “The judge’s patience is running out, and so is the people’s,” he said.",https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-puerto-rico-9d6df069e2850bda17c94909789400ec,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico debt restructuring at risk amid uncertainty over key bill,Maria Chutchian,10/25/21," Puerto Rico could see its fouryear financial restructuring process thrown out of court without a resolution if the island's lawmakers do not approve legislation that would enable a plan to adjust $35 billion in debt to proceed. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who has been overseeing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, said at a hearing on Monday she would consider dismissing the entire case, known as a Title III proceeding, if the plan falls apart. Its future became unclear after Puerto Rico's Senate failed to approve legislation by Oct. 22 to authorize the issuance of new bonds, which is critical to the plan. The federally appointed board tasked with overseeing Puerto Rico's economic recovery process was set to present its proposed debt adjustment plan, which would reduce Puerto Rico's $35 billion in public debt to $7.4 billion, for court approval at a hearing beginning Nov. 8. That timeline is now at risk because of the Senate's failure to meet last week's deadline. The Senate will return from recess on Tuesday and lawmakers are working on amendments that could push the bill forward soon, according to court filings. Meanwhile, lawyers for the oversight board and Puerto Rico's government will resume confidential mediation to discuss ways to keep the plan alive. A mediator will file a report on Nov. 2 on whether the plan can move forward. If the mediator does not believe it can, the oversight board will tell the court by Nov. 4 whether it thinks the plan can be approved without the legislation or present any alternative measures it thinks would be appropriate. The judge said that if the board decides the plan cannot move forward, she may consider dismissing the case. The commonwealth has spent nearly $1 billion on legal fees during the case, according to court papers.

"Thousands march in Puerto Rico, outraged over power outages",DÁNICA COTO,10/16/21,"More than 4,000 people outraged over ongoing power outages in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico marched Friday to decry how the lack of electricity has affected their health, work and children’s schooling. Many of them demanded the ouster of Luma, a private company that took over the island’s transmission and distribution of power on June 1. Some also are angry at Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which owns and operates generation units that have been breaking down in recent weeks largely due to a lack of maintenance and repair. “We’re tired of coming home and discovering that we have no lights,” said Mayra Rivera, 55, adding she is especially worried about her parents, who are in their 90s, and the sweltering heat they face at home. Thousands marched down a main highway in the capital of San Juan as the sun set, blocking traffic. Once dark, they held their cellphones aloft, turning the highway into a sea of tiny lights. The highway was last shut down during large protests in 2019 that led to the resignation of the governor.  Some wore T-shirts that read, “Go to hell, Luma” as they clapped or banged on pots while walking behind huge speakers on pickups that blasted slogans such as, “My power went out, damn it, and now my fridge will be ruined.” Among those marching was Juan Antonio Rivera, 78, who said the most recent outage left him in the dark this week for 43 hours. Previous ones damaged his two computers. “And one of them cost $200 to fix!” he exclaimed. “I have the receipts at home to send to Luma.” Power outages have occurred more frequently and lasted longer in recent months, with people complaining that they cannot give themselves respiratory therapies or have had to throw away insulin or food. Many also have complained that they can’t work or their children are unable to attend online classes, and that expensive appliances have been damaged. Cicma Albino, a 56-year-old teacher from Guayama who drove more than an hour to participate in the demonstration, said outages affected her school for three days. “We had to send them home,” she said of the students. Outages have not only occurred after generation units break down, but also because of selective blackouts announced by Luma that last several hours after officials warn that demand is exceeding supply. One demonstrator who worked as a linesman for the Electric Power Authority donned his work clothes complete with helmet and tool belt, saying he was frustrated and angry over the outages since his mother is bedridden. “She will suffer,” said Jesús Ambert of the outages. Puerto Rico’s power grid has grown increasingly unstable after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. Efforts to strengthen the grid have yet to start, with the government announcing on Thursday the first disbursement of federal funds to the Electric Power Authority, with $7.1 million slated for reconstruction work. The money is part of an overall $9.5 billion obligated by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild the grid. The authority’s new director, Josué Colón, said officials have identified various projects totaling $2.4 billion. He also noted that the generation units are in “critical condition.” The march comes on the same day that Luma announced it provided electricity for the first time to a community in the neighboring island of Culebra that had depended exclusively on generators or battery-operated solar panels. The company on Friday also was authorized to launch eight transmission and distribution reconstruction projects worth $117 million.",https://apnews.com/article/business-health-caribbean-power-outages-puerto-rico-b3afa248e406f33359fe3ca365dd221d,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico ponders race amid surprising census results,DÁNICA COTO,10/15/21,"The number of people in Puerto Rico who identified as “white” in the most recent census plummeted almost 80%, sparking a conversation about identity on an island breaking away from a past where race was not tracked and seldom debated in public. The drastic drop surprised many, and theories abound as the U.S. territory’s 3.3 million people begin to reckon with racial identity. “Puerto Ricans themselves are understanding their whiteness comes with an asterisk,” said Yarimar Bonilla, a political anthropologist and director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York. “They know they’re not white by U.S. standards, but they’re not Black by Puerto Rico standards.” Nearly 50% of those represented in the 2020 census — 1.6 million of 3.29 million — identified with “two races or more,” a jump from 3% — or some 122,200 of 3.72 million — who chose that option in the 2010 census. Most of them selected “white and some other race.”  Meanwhile, more than 838,000 people identified as “some other race alone,” a nearly 190% jump compared with some 289,900 people a decade ago, although Bonilla said Census Bureau officials have yet to release what races they chose. Experts believe people likely wrote “Puerto Rican,” “Hispanic” or “Latino,” even though federal policy defines those categories as ethnicity, not race. Among those who changed their response to race was 45-year-old Tamara Texidor, who selected “other” in 2010 and this time opted to identify herself as “Afrodescendent.” She said she made the decision after talking to her brother, who was a census worker and told her how people he encountered when he went house to house often had trouble with the question about race. Texidor began reflecting about her ancestry and wanted to honor it since she descended from slaves on her father’s side. “I’m not going to select ‘other,’” she recalled thinking when filling out the census. “I feel I am something.” Experts are still debating what sparked the significant changes in the 2020 census. Some believe several factors are at play, including tweaks in wording and a change in how the Census Bureau processes and codes responses.  Bonilla also thinks a growing awareness of racial identity in Puerto Rico played a part, saying that “extra intense racialization” in the past decade might have contributed. She and other anthropologists argue that change stemmed from anger over what many consider a botched federal response to a U.S. territory struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria and a crippling economic crisis. “They’ve finally understood that they’re treated like second-class citizens,” Bárbara Abadía-Rexach, a sociocultural anthropologist, said of Puerto Ricans. Another critical change in the 2020 census was that only a little over 228,700 identified solely as Black or African American, a nearly 50% drop compared with more than 461,000 who did so a decade ago. The decline occurred even as grass-roots organizations in Puerto Rico launched campaigns to urge people to embrace their African heritage and raised awareness about racial disparities, although they said they were encouraged by the increase in the “two or more races” category. Bonilla noted Puerto Rico currently has no reliable data to determine whether such disparities have occurred during the pandemic, noting that there is no racial data on coronavirus testing, hospitalizations or fatalities. The island’s government also does not collect racial data on populations, including those who are homeless or incarcerated, Abadía-Rexach added. “The denial of the existence of racism renders invisible, criminalizes and dehumanizes many Black people in Puerto Rico,” she said. The lack of such data could be rooted in Puerto Rico’s history. From 1960 to 2000, the island conducted its own census and never asked about race. “We were supposed to be all mixed and all equal, and race was supposed to be an American thing,” Bonilla said. Some argued at the time that Puerto Rico should be tracking racial data while others viewed it as a divisive move that would impose or harden racial differences, a view largely embraced in France, which does not collect official data on race or ethnicity. For Isar Godreau, an anthropologist and professor at the University of Puerto Rico, that type of data is crucial. “Skin color is an important marker that makes people vulnerable to more or less racial discrimination,” she said. The data helps people fight for racial justice and determines the allocation of resources, Godreau said. The major shift in the 2020 census — especially how only 560,592 people identified as white versus more than 2.8 million in 2010 — comes amid a growing interest in racial identity in Puerto Rico, where even recent surveys about race prompted responses ranging from “members of the human race” to “normal” to “I get along with everyone.” Informally, people on the island use a wide range of words to describe someone’s skin color, including “coffee with milk.”  That interest is fueled largely by a younger generation: They have signed up for classes of bomba and plena — centuries-old, percussion-powered musical traditions — as well as workshops on how to make or wear headwraps.  More hair salons are specializing in curly hair, eschewing the blow-dried results that long dominated professional settings in the island. Some legislators have submitted a bill that cites the results of the 2020 census and that if approved would make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their hair style. Several U.S. states already have similar laws. As debate continues on what sparked so many changes in the 2020 census, Bonilla said an important question is what the 2030 census results will look like. “Will we see an intensification of this pattern, or will 2020 have been kind of a blip moment?”",https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-census-2020-puerto-rico-e2cb57f6e4ea5f6eb0ebdacd9ed266e5,AP,Neutral

The system means that government employees can virtually access a variety of documents, eliminating the need for citizens and business owners to visit different state agencies to obtain them in person as they seek permits, contracts, services or certificates. The announcement was welcomed by many in this territory of 3.3 million people who have long complained about the convoluted process to obtain such documents. The documents that government agencies can access online include certificates of good standing, criminal records and business registrations.

Supreme Court leaves in place Puerto Rico cockfighting ban,No Author,10/12/21,"The Supreme Court is leaving in place a federal law that bars cockfighting in Puerto Rico. The high court on Tuesday turned away a challenge to the law. As is typical, the high court did not explain why it declined to take the case.  
Congress in 2018 changed a federal law that had permitted cockfighting in the territory. Individuals and organizations involved in cockfighting challenged the law, arguing that Congress had exceeded its powers in applying the ban to Puerto Rico. They noted that “cockfighting is deeply ingrained in the island’s history, tradition and culture.”  Cockfighting was introduced into the territory by the Spanish in the 16th century and Puerto Rican law calls it a “cultural right of all Puerto Ricans.” Puerto Rico estimates cockfighting supports more than 11,000 jobs and brings about $65 million into the territory’s economy annually. Two lower courts had sided with the federal government and said Congress acted appropriately. Also on Tuesday, the Supreme Court turned away a challenge by organized labor opponents in Washington to a public records law that allows unions, but not the general public, to obtain contact information for in-home health care workers.  A federal appeals court ruled the law doesn’t violate the Constitution, but the challengers had hoped the court would follow on recent rulings against organized labor by taking up their case. The contact information would enable union opponents to more easily try to persuade the health-care providers to stop paying union dues. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the case.",https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-congress-puerto-rico-1832c7fddefbf1ded3464cfc83af8b45,AP,Neutral
US legislators probing Puerto Rico power outages demand data,DÁNICA COTO,10/8/21,"A U.S. House committee on Friday demanded that the company in charge of the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico release key data amid widespread outages in the U.S. territory that have outraged and frustrated many. The Committee on Natural Resources ordered Luma to submit by Oct. 22 information including the number of maintenance workers it employs, the estimated amount of time one generation unit will be inoperable and the compensation packages and titles of employees who earn more than $200,000 a year. The letter comes two days after officials including Luma CEO Wayne Stensby testified at a hearing held by the committee to learn more about the ongoing outages in Puerto Rico. “Many of your answers were incomplete. You refused to answer others,” stated the committee, which oversees U.S. territorial affairs. Luma previously was sued by Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives for similar information, with the island’s Supreme Court ordering the company to turn over the data, although that hasn’t occurred. At the time, Stensby said the company is private and the information confidential. Luma issued a statement on Friday saying its more than 3,100 employees are working hard despite “the numerous and very difficult challenges from those that oppose the transformation,” adding that much misinformation has been spread. However, the company did not address the questions and concerns raised by the committee. The outages have forced schools and workplaces to close and sparked concern for those who depend on insulin or oxygen. The lack of power also has led to losses at thousands of businesses across the island, including a small store that Carmen Lydia de Jesús owns in the central mountain town of Ciales. She estimates she has lost $6,000 as a result of not being able to open her business, noting that power surges also sparked a fire at her house and caused more than $4,000 in damage. “It’s a miracle I wasn’t burned,” she said. “We can’t continue like this. This is abusive.” Luma took the reins of Puerto Rico’s transmission and distribution on June 1 and has faced sharp criticism ever since. The U.S. House committee letter said that in some cases, conditions have worsened since Luma took over. Legislators demanded information including the number and length of outages, the causes behind every service disruption and the number of voltage fluctuations that caused property damage. Current and former government officials have blamed the outages on the retirement of experienced employees and a lack of maintenance of generation units owned and managed by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority. They also note the power grid remains fragile after Hurricane Maria struck the island in September 2017 as a Category 4 storm, and that reconstruction has yet to start. On Friday, the power authority’s governing board approved a declaration of a state of emergency to speed up contracts and the purchases of costly equipment, although Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he didn’t feel it was needed since the authority was already authorized to do that.",https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-congress-puerto-rico-power-outages-d659a96650f47ad49c328cde2d45150a,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico high court: Not guilty verdict must be unanimous,DÁNICA COTO,9/9/21,"Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court ruled Thursday that not guilty verdicts in criminal cases must be unanimous, marking a significant change in how jury trials are conducted in the U.S. territory. For nearly seven decades, Puerto Rico’s constitution has allowed a minimum of nine jurors for such verdicts. The 5-2 decision comes more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that jury verdicts must be unanimous to convict in criminal trials, a decision that affected Louisiana, Oregon and Puerto Rico, which had not required unanimity for a guilty verdict. Though that decision specifically concerned unanimity in guilty verdicts, it sparked discussion in Puerto Rico about how the island’s judicial system should handle not guilty verdicts. In their decision, the majority of judges on Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court said justice demands unanimity also be required for not guilty verdicts, to maintain the same decision proportion for both guilty and not guilty verdicts as required by Puerto Rico’s constitution. Two judges dissented. One accused his colleagues of distortion and the other said the decision ignores constitutional protections.  The dissenters also argued that a defendant’s culpability is being judged, not their innocence. “Why ... is it necessary that a jury see itself entirely convinced of an absence of culpability that is already presumed and is up to the state to defeat?” wrote Judge Luis Estrella Martínez. The ruling stems from a 2016 case involving a Puerto Rico man accused of first-degree murder and other charges. Puerto Rico’s Tribunal of First Instance held a hearing last November to talk about jury instructions for his case. Prosecutors requested the jury be told unanimity was required for a guilty or not guilty verdict based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling the previous year. The defense attorney disputed that position, noting that Puerto Rico’s constitution states that only a minimum of nine jurors are required for a not guilty verdict.  The tribunal found in favor of the defense attorney, and prosecutors took the issue to Puerto Rico’s Court of Appeals, which upheld the tribunal’s ruling. “In a criminal procedure, the only thing that is being judged is the culpability of the accused, not their innocence. Their innocence is presumed at all times. It makes no sense to have to prove something that is presumed until it is defeated with evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,” the appeals court stated. Prosecutors then appealed to the island’s Supreme Court. The defense attorney argued the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling applied only to guilty verdicts, while prosecutors argued that Puerto Rico’s constitution does not allow a different number of jurors to be required for a guilty versus a not guilty verdict. The high court decided the constitution does require the same standards for each kind of verdict. Legal experts said they disagreed with Thursday’s ruling. “I feel this is a mistake that doesn’t think about administrative and technical issues,” said Wanda Valentín, former president of the association’s criminal law commission. Puerto Rico required a jury’s 12 members to unanimously agree on finding a defendant guilty or not guilty until 1948, when the law was amended to allow either verdict to be based on a majority of at least nine jurors. The amendment was made at a time when the government was prosecuting leaders seeking Puerto Rico’s independence, which made it easier for them to be found guilty, Valentín said. The provision was added to the island’s constitution in 1952. A request that the court reconsider its ruling can be submitted. If the court denied such a petition, the last recourse would be the U.S. Supreme Court.",https://apnews.com/95466f25620c82df1d706acd1bdcfeba,AP,Neutral

"Puerto Rico requires vaccinations in food, drink sector",DÁNICA COTO,8/11/21,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Wednesday that employees of restaurants or other enclosed places that serve food or drinks will have to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, and customers will have to show a vaccination card or a negative virus test. The new rules, which take effect Aug. 23, come as the U.S. territory faces a spike in coronavirus infections blamed largely on the delta variant. Those who do not comply face up to six months in jail or up to a $5,000 fine. “As governor, I have the responsibility ... of taking the necessary measures to guarantee everyone’s health,” said Gov.

Pierluisi said another option will soon be available: a QR code that vaccinated people can obtain if they enroll through a new government system.  While the vaccination requirements are mandatory for employees, restaurants and other places that decide not to request proof from customers must lower their maximum capacity to 50%, the governor said. Pierluisi added that if employees do not get vaccinated, they must present negative coronavirus tests. “If these measures do not have a significant impact, I will be forced to implement additional restrictions,” Pierluisi said. The former and future presidents of Puerto Rico’s Restaurant Association said they fully support that employees be vaccinated but raised concerns about asking clients for proof of vaccination or a negative test. Mateo Cidre, the association’s upcoming president and owner of several restaurants, said that the logistics will be complicated and that he had hoped they would be given time to see how New York City implements such measures. He wondered what he should do if a customer shows up and says he cannot be vaccinated for health reasons. “Am I supposed to ask him why not, what does he have?” Cidre said. Ramón Leal, the association’s former president, said restaurants will likely end up losing money and opt to operate at 50% capacity because employees are scarce and owners can’t afford to have a worker exclusively posted at the door to check customers. “There’s a shortage never before seen in the restaurant industry,” he said of workers, adding that scenario could change once federal pandemic funds run out in upcoming weeks.  Wednesday’s announcement follows recent ones in which Puerto Rico’s governor has said that vaccinations are required of public employees, government contractors, hotel guests and staff and all health facility workers, among others. “The goal here is for everyone to get vaccinated,” he said. The U.S. territory of more than 3.3 million people has reported more than 130,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 2,600 deaths from COVID-19. Some 76% of people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.",https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-business-health-caribbean-coronavirus-pandemic-04985332beddaeccdee60d1b24d0e48e,AP,Neutral
"Rain pelts Puerto Rico, USVI as Tropical Storm Fred forms",DÁNICA COTO,8/11/21,"Heavy rains pelted the northern Caribbean as a weather disturbance strengthened into Tropical Storm Fred south of Puerto Rico late Tuesday following a quiet month of no named storms in the region. Power outages were already reported in Puerto Rico, where Luma, the company in charge of the U.S. territory’s transmission and distribution system, warned those who depend on electricity for life-saving medical devices to activate emergency plans. “Puerto Rico’s system ... continues to be very fragile,” the company said, referring to a power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The storm’s center was 45 miles (70 kilometers) south-southwest of Ponce, Puerto Rico, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Its maximum sustained winds increased to 40 mph (65 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico for Fred, which is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. “The most important thing today is preparation,” said Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “I am not going to minimize the potential impact of this event...we expect a lot of rain.” Pierluisi said government agencies would close by noon Tuesday and officials noted that some gas stations had closed after running out of fuel. The heaviest rain was expected to fall overnight, forecasters said. Eight shelters were opened across the island, though officials said only about seven people had checked in by midevening. “Do not wait until the last minute to mobilize,” said Nino Correa, Puerto Rico’s emergency management commissioner. “We don’t want to have fatalities.” The Dominican Republic, Haiti and the southern Bahamas could get hit Wednesday, and people in Florida were urged to monitor updates, but forecasters said it remained uncertain where the storm would move later in the week. Copious rains hit parts of the eastern Caribbean during Monday night, including the islands of Guadeloupe and Dominica. More than a month had passed since the last named Atlantic storm, Hurricane Elsa, but this time of summer usually marks the start of the peak of hurricane season. The hurricane center issued warnings for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic on the south coast from Punta Palenque eastward and on the north coast from Cabo Frances Viejo eastward. A watch was in effect for Hispaniola’s north coast, from Cabo Frances in the Dominican Republic to Gonaives, Haiti. The Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas were also under a tropical storm watch, including the Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Cay, the Inaguas, Mayaguana, and the Ragged Islands. The storm was expected to produce rainfall of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) over the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) in some areas, and could lead to flooding and mudslides.",https://apnews.com/article/environment-and-nature-caribbean-storms-tropical-storms-a95dae1fe983e72b8fb860220238a2ae,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico widens vaccine requirements amid COVID-19 spike,DÁNICA COTO,8/5/21,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Thursday that vaccinations will be required of government contractors, hotel guests and employees and all health facility workers to control a spike in COVID-19 cases blamed largely on the Delta variant. The order goes into effect Aug. 16; those who refuse to get inoculated will be required to submit a weekly negative COVID-19 test. Violators will face up to a $5,000 fine or six months in jail, with few exceptions allowed. “We cannot lower our guard,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “There are vaccines for everyone. Vaccinations are the solution.” The announcement comes as Puerto Rico reports an 11% transmission rate this month, compared with a 1.4% rate reported in late June. Pierluisi said the requirement applies to all those working in health facilities including laboratories and elderly care centers as well as those in short-term rentals including Airbnbs. He said government contractors who meet with officials in person will be required to show vaccination proof. The governor previously announced that vaccinations will be required of all government employees working in their office. Carlos Mellado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary, said the majority of cases are being driven by the Delta variant. He noted that 20% of current hospitalizations are people who have already received two vaccine doses and added that the government will not issue health certificates unless proof of vaccination is submitted. The U.S. territory of 3.3 million people has reported more than 128,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,500 deaths.

Puerto Rico dock workers to end strike as goods accumulate,DÁNICA COTO,8/4/21,"Dock workers who launched a strike that prevented thousands of shipping containers with items including food and medicine from reaching Puerto Rico in recent weeks have reached a tentative agreement with their employer, officials said Wednesday. Many in the U.S. territory were relieved at the announcement, given the island’s huge dependence on imports. However, concerns remain since the deal between Puerto Rico’s Union of Dock Workers and stowage company Luis Ayala Colón Sucres, Inc. is in place for only 45 days. The strike had prevented some 4,500 shipping containers and 13 boats from reaching Puerto Rico and another 5,000 containers from leaving the island. It also prompted the U.S. territory’s government to file a lawsuit on Monday against union workers and the company known as LAC, which handles 80% of all international cargo entering the Port of San Juan. “The situation has reached a breaking point,” Puerto Rico’s Ports Authority said in the lawsuit. It is seeking a permanent injunction ordering that those sued meet their responsibilities, noting that it has been unable to collect more than $400,000 in fees and tariffs. Noelia García, the government’s chief of staff, said the lawsuit will be withdrawn only when the deal between dock workers and the stowage company is final. She also hinted that government officials might look into contracting other companies to avoid a repeat. “Diversity is healthy,” she said. “We’re going to take proactive measures to ensure this won’t happen again.” García declined to provide more details. Hernán Ayala, vice president of the stowage company, said there are no plans to prioritize items. “We’ll empty the ships as they arrive,” he said. “This will be done as quickly as possible.” The workers were striking in part because they said the company had given workshop tasks to managers. While the strike did not cause severe shortages of life-saving items, the Association of Hospitals of Puerto Rico issued a statement Tuesday warning that supplies of certain medical equipment would run out in two to six weeks as the island faces a spike in COVID-19 cases it blames on the delta variant.",https://apnews.com/article/business-health-caribbean-coronavirus-pandemic-puerto-rico-48e1e28b79a413239f748a8448a5a6d2,AP,Neutral
1st cruise ship docks in Puerto Rico since pandemic began,DÁNICA COTO,8/3/21,"The Carnival Mardi Gras docked Tuesday in Puerto Rico — the first time a cruise ship has visited the U.S. territory since the pandemic began.  Some cautiously celebrated the arrival. It comes as Puerto Rico has reported an increase in COVID-19 cases blamed on the Delta variant but also as it seeks to restart its crucial tourism sector, which depended largely on record numbers of cruise ship passengers in recent years. Carlos Mercado, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Tourism Company, told The Associated Press that the government took several precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including allowing only those who are fully vaccinated to disembark. He said the ship was traveling at 70% capacity, with some 4,500 people aboard, and that he estimates a total of 3,500 will disembark. Mercado noted that 95% of the ship’s passengers are vaccinated, with children younger than 12 making up the majority of those who have not been inoculated. The visit was expected to generate some $360,000 during the nine hours that the ship is docked in the historic part of Puerto Rico’s capital known as Old San Juan. “This is incredibly important for us,” Mercado said, noting that Puerto Rico’s hotel and aviation sector has boomed in recent months. “This is what we were missing.” Passengers began to trickle out of the ship to the sounds of Puerto Rico’s traditional bomba and plena music filling a nearby plaza while artisans prepared their wares and government officials distributed maps of the historic cobblestone district. Passenger Tom Seuberling, of Oak Hill, Florida, said he was impressed by the health protocols aboard the ship. “You had to have proof of vaccination. They got sanitation throughout the ship. They make sure that you don’t contaminate food bars. They have been very cautious about cleaning the rooms,” he said. “It has been a remarkable job.” Mercado said the ship will dock twice more this month, generating an estimated total of $1.2 million for August. He added that starting next month, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship will start using San Juan as its base port, and that by next year, he expects the cruise schedule to go back to normal. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said that visits of the Carnival Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration in the next two years alone will deliver an estimated 300,000 passengers and generate some $28 million for the island’s tourism sector, which represents nearly 7% of its economy. Some 1.9 million cruise passengers visited Puerto Rico in 2019, a record for the island, according to tourism spokeswoman Astrid Rolón. The Carnival Mardi Gras departed Port Canaveral, Florida, and Puerto Rico was its first stop.  The island of 3.3 million people has reported more than 127,500 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 2,500 deaths. Some 1.9 million people are fully vaccinated. ___ AP photographer Carlos Rivera contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-health-travel-caribbean-pandemics-bc7ca737ea23c57020812c2de0bcd6f6,AP,Neutral
"Australia beats Puerto Rico 96-69, advances to quarters",TERESA M. WALKER,8/2/21,"The Australia Opals didn’t get anywhere close to the start they wanted. They made up for it by how they finished with the big margin of victory needed to stick around the Olympics. Marianna Tolo scored 26 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as Australia beat Puerto Rico 95-69 Monday night to advance to the quarterfinals of the women’s tournament.  “Obviously very relieved,” Australia coach Sandy Brondello said.  Australia will play the United States in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.  The world’s second-ranked team came in needing to beat Puerto Rico by at least 24 points to advance with another tiebreaker. Anything less would send the Opals home with Canada advancing to the quarterfinals. FanDuel set a line favoring Australia by 36.  “It doesn’t happen very often does it in our situation?” said Brondello, also head coach of the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury.  She tried to get Australia to break the game into quarters and focus on smaller goals like trying to get three consecutive stops twice in each quarter. The Opals won by enough to end Canada’s stay before the knockout round, though they needed a 10-0 run over the final 2:19 to clinch and start a celebration.  “The way we finished the game that’s the brand of basketball that we’re known for and that’s what we’re going to take into the (quarter)finals,” Australia forward Cayla George said.  Australia played without Liz Cambage, who withdrew before the Tokyo Games, and Stephanie Talbot, who plays with the WNBA’s Seattle Storm. She missed the Olympic opener with an injured foot, played the first half of a loss to China but stayed on the bench for the second half.  George scored 19 points for Australia. Jenna O’Hea added 15, Leilani Mitchell had 12 and Ezi Magbegor 10.  Jazmon Gwathmey led Puerto Rico (0-3) with 26 points. Pamela Rosado had 13 and Jennifer O’Neill added 12.  The Opals missed their first five shots. Puerto Rico didn’t and scored the first eight points and led 24-22 after 10 minutes. Australia led 45-44 at halftime.

Puerto Rico board finalizes deal securing bond insurers' support for debt plan,Maria Chutchian,7/27/21," The federally appointed financial oversight board tasked with guiding Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring has finalized a deal with two key creditors, adding to  growing support  for the proposed plan to fix the commonwealth’s debt crisis. The oversight board, represented by Proskauer Rose, announced its pact with bond insurers Ambac Financial Group and Financial Guaranty Insurance Company in a statement on Tuesday. The settlement resolves the bond insurers’ litigation over rights to certain revenues and sets aside $260 million for holders of debt issued by the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA). Puerto Rico filed for its bankruptcylike court proceeding, known as a Title III case, in May 2017 to address its approximately $120 billion in public debt and pension liabilities. In recent months, the board has struck deals with a variety of powerful creditor groups that should help it conclude the Title III proceedings by the end of the year. Under the proposed  debt adjustment plan , Puerto Rico’s $35 billion in public debt would be reduced to $7.4 billion and more than $50 billion in pension liabilities would be restructured. The  proposal  has support from several groups of bondholders and other creditors but still faces opposition from the Puerto Rican government, as well as some retail investors and individual citizens. Ambac, represented by Milbank, and FGIC, represented by Butler Snow, insure hundreds of millions of dollars in PRIFA bonds, which the authority stopped paying in 2015. Under the agreement announced Tuesday, PRIFA bondholders will collect $260 million in cash – a 90% discount to PRIFA claims, according to the board’s statement. Of that amount, Ambac will receive $34.75 million and FGIC will receive $21.75 million, according to  court papers . At the request of the board, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who sits on both the Manhattan and San Juan federal courts, postponed the continuation of a July 13 hearing that was scheduled to occur on Tuesday on soliciting creditor votes. The hearing is now set for Thursday. At the July 13 hearing, a lawyer for the board had told Swain that it had reached a  tentative deal  with Ambac and FGIC. Tuesday’s statement confirms the settlement. The judge overruled some objections to the proposed solicitation at that hearing but said she would wait to issue a final ruling until the Ambac and FGIC agreement was finalized. Despite the increasing support from creditors for the oversight board’s debt restructuring, Puerto Rico’s government remains opposed to proposed pension cuts tied to the plan. The board sued the government in early July to block legislation that it says would reintroduce expensive pension obligations that the plan is specifically trying to address. The case is In re Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, No. 1703283.

Puerto Rico nets 'verbal' deal with bond insurers as legal fees near $1 billion,Maria Chutchian,7/14/21," Puerto Rico has reached a tentative agreement with two bond insurers that have long opposed its debt restructuring proposal, a lawyer for the federallyappointed financial oversight board said on Wednesday. Brian Rosen of Proskauer Rose made the announcement about the “verbal understanding” at the outset of a virtual hearing before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in San Juan. The deal, with bond insurers Ambac Assurance Corp and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co, still needs to be finalized and documented, Rosen said. The tentative accord comes a day after the oversight board announced an agreement with its official unsecured creditors’ committee that secures its support for the  restructuring . The board hopes to push through its  debt adjustment plan  by the end of the year. Under the proposed plan, Puerto Rico’s $35 billion in public debt would be reduced to $7.4 billion and more than $50 billion in pension liabilities would be restructured. The proposal has support among several groups of bondholders but still faces opposition from the Puerto Rican government, as well as some retail investors and individual citizens. As a result of the tentative bond insurer settlement, Swain will likely wait until later this month to issue a formal ruling on the board’s request to begin soliciting creditor votes for the plan. Atara Miller of Milbank, who represents Ambac, said during Wednesday’s hearing that she is “pleased” by the agreement reached with the board and that Ambac will soon move to halt ongoing  litigation over rights to certain revenues  that they say secure their bonds. Puerto Rico is now four years into its courtsupervised bankruptcylike process, known as Title III. The case has racked up approximately $943 million in legal fees, according to a  report  from the courtappointed fee examiner filed on Tuesday night. The major dispute remaining involves the Puerto Rican government, which opposes pension cuts proposed in the board’s plan. The plan would impose an 8.5% cut to public pensions with a floor to ensure no monthly retirement benefits are below $1,500. The board  sued  the government in early July to block legislation that it says would reintroduce expensive pension obligations that the plan is specifically trying to address.

Puerto Rico financial oversight board lands deal with junior creditors,Maria Chutchian,7/13/21," The federally appointed board tasked with guiding Puerto Rico's  debt restructuring  has reached a deal that garners support from a group of junior creditors for its proposed debt adjustment plan. A lawyer for the Financial Oversight and Management Board, Brian Rosen of Proskauer Rose, announced the agreement during a virtual hearing on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing the commonwealth’s bankruptcylike proceedings in San Juan. The accord is a key step toward Puerto Rico’s ability to exit its socalled Title III debt restructuring process, which is now four years old. The agreement boosts the unsecured creditors’ payouts to $575 million, from $125 million previously, according to Rosen. The deal was disclosed during Tuesday’s hearing on the financial oversight board's request to  begin soliciting creditor votes  for its proposed plan. A lawyer for the unsecured creditors’ committee, Luc Despins of Paul Hastings, confirmed during the hearing that his group has dropped its prior opposition to the vote solicitation. The committee support is a notable step forward for the board, which is hoping it can corral the support it needs to conclude the commonwealth’s lengthy restructuring this year. The  proposed plan  would reduce Puerto Rico’s $35 billion in public debt to $7.4 billion and restructure more than $50 billion in pension liabilities. The proposal has support among several groups of bondholders but still faces opposition from bond insurers Ambac Assurance Corp and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co, the Puerto Rican government, as well as some retail investors and individual citizens. Negotiations among the Financial Oversight and Management Board, Ambac and FGIC are ongoing and could result in a deal this evening, lawyers for the board and the bond insurers said on Tuesday. The commonwealth sought relief in 2017 under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, which was created to provide the territory – which is not eligible to file for traditional U.S. bankruptcy protection – a means of restructuring its $120 billion debt load. A lawyer for Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, John Rapisardi of O’Melveny & Myers, said on Tuesday that the government remains opposed to proposed pension cuts embedded in the debt adjustment plan. Earlier this month, the financial oversight board  sued  Governor Pedro Pierluisi and other top government officials to block a new law it says would interfere with the pension restructuring. “I hope and pray this is not resolved through more litigation and delay but is overcome through consensus,” Rapisardi said during the hearing. The entity tasked with issuing new bonds to restructure debts of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, known as the GDB Debt Recovery Authority, also raised issues with the proposed plan. Douglas Mintz of Schulte Roth & Zabel, representing the entity’s collateral monitor, said on Tuesday that the plan cannot be approved because it attempts to use $264 million in assets belonging to the Highways and Transportation Authority to pay off certain bondholder claims ahead of the DRA’s HTA loans. The HTA is undergoing its own Title III proceeding and has not yet proposed its own debt adjustment plan. The hearing on the solicitation of creditor votes for the plan, which can only begin once Swain determines the board has made adequate disclosures to inform creditors of the details of the plan, will resume on Wednesday morning.

Puerto Rico to lift face mask requisite for those vaccinated,No Author,7/1/21,"Fully vaccinated people in Puerto Rico will no longer be required to wear face masks starting next week with few exceptions, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi announced on Thursday. He also said that capacity restrictions at all businesses will be lifted as the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations across the U.S. territory keeps dropping. Both measures go into effect July 5. “Each day we get closer to normal,” Pierluisi said, acknowledging that it will be difficult to determine who has been vaccinated. Face masks, however, will still be required of everyone who visits a hospital, doctor’s office or dental clinic, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said. He added that face masks also are required for those younger than 12. “It’s important that we protect those who are vulnerable,” he said. Some health experts criticized the governor’s announcement, saying the face mask requirement should be upheld given the presence on the island of the delta variant, which scientists believe is about 50% more transmissible than other types. The U.S. territory of 3.3 million people has reported nearly 123,000 cases and more than 2,500 deaths. Pierluisi said 74% of adults have received at least one vaccine dose, while more than 63% are fully vaccinated.",https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-health-coronavirus-pandemic-2c9ce06f59a79c67715f0f15d219a28a,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to receive nearly $4B in US pandemic funds,DÁNICA COTO,6/28/21,"U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Monday that Puerto Rico will receive nearly $4 billion in federal education pandemic relief funds to help boost the U.S. territory’s fight against COVID-19. The announcement was made during Cardona’s official three-day trip to Puerto Rico, the first for a Biden administration Cabinet member. It marks the first time the island has full access to those funds. “The students of Puerto Rico have suffered enough,” he said. “It’s time to get back to school safely and quickly.” Roughly half of the nearly $4 billion will be released as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, which was signed into law in March to help offset the pandemic’s impact on the economy and public health. Puerto Rico reopened dozens of public and private schools in March for the first time since the pandemic began, although less than 100 of the island’s more than 850 public schools were authorized to do so. At the time, only kindergarteners, special education students and children in first, second, third and 12th grades were allowed to return to school for in-person classes twice a week. A month later, officials closed all schools given a spike in COVID-19 cases and didn’t reopen some of them until May. For more than a year, many teachers and students have struggled with ongoing power outages and unreliable or nonexistent internet connections amid virtual learning. Some 24,000 students failed their classes this year, with 13,000 receiving an ‘F’ in all their courses, prompting the island’s Department of Education to hold summer courses to help them with the help of $210 million in previously approved federal funds. Cardona said that in addition to meeting with Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, he also will meet with students, parents, educators, union leaders and others “to make sure we hear what’s happening and how we can best support...Puerto Rico.” It wasn’t immediately known exactly how Pierluisi’s administration planned to spend the newest federal funds. The announcement comes three months after Cardona announced that Puerto Rico had immediate access to $912 million in federal education money.

Power outage hits 337K in Puerto Rico amid growing outrage,DÁNICA COTO,6/17/21,"A sudden power failure left more than 337,000 customers in the dark across Puerto Rico late Wednesday, enraging many who were recovering from a massive outage that hit the U.S. territory just days ago. Luma Energy, a private company that took over the island’s power transmission and distribution system on June 1, said three units were knocked offline for reasons not immediately known. At first, the company said some 190,000 customers had been affected, but it later tweeted that power had been restored to more than 252,700 customers, leaving more 84,000 still without electricity.  Various spokeswomen did not return calls for comment. The latest outage unleashed a flood of complaints on social media as anger spread among thousands of people who were forced to throw out food and refrigerated medication including insulin in recent days. Some also complained about damaged appliances as lights flickered on and off since Thursday’s outage that left 900,000 people in the dark. Wednesday’s outage came just hours after Luma warned that services would be interrupted nightly for the next three days given pre-scheduled maintenance at one plant and interruptions in the generation of power run by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority. The most recent outage is not related to the upcoming interruptions in service, Luma said. It’s the latest challenge to hit a company that has come under scrutiny amid high expectations that it would briskly solve problems despite having to rely on aging infrastructure and a fragile power grid that has not been strengthened since Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017 as a Category 4 storm, leaving some customers without power for up to a year. Victoria Pérez, who lives in the capital of San Juan, said power in her neighborhood of Río Piedras usually goes out two to three times a week, but that outages have recently worsened. She and her family already had spent two days without electricity when Thursday’s massive outage hit, adding that they have had to adjust their budget and buy gasoline to keep their generator going. “These days it’s been running like it’s Maria all over again,” she said. “The entire neighborhood is noisy.” The outages have been so constant lately that several mayors have declared states of emergency and handed out generators and ice to those most in need, as well as hired private crews to restore power after saying that Luma informed them they lacked enough brigades. Earlier Wednesday, Luma said it was still probing what caused a large fire at a main substation that led to Thursday’s outage, adding that the investigation won’t be finalized for another four to six weeks. Luma is a consortium made up of Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston. It serves roughly 1.5 million customers as part of a 15-year contract with Puerto Rico’s government, which remains the owner and operator of the island’s power generators.",https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-power-outages-business-9894e9679ef144acb08973e199b8b73a,AP,Neutral
"New company, same woes: Puerto Rico suffers power outages",DÁNICA COTO,6/11/21,"A private company that took over power transmission and distribution in Puerto Rico this month has struggled with widespread outages and growing anger as it scrambled to control a fire that left hundreds of thousands of clients in the dark. Officials say outages had affected more than 1 million customers so far this month, not counting those affected by the explosion and fire at a main substation in the capital of San Juan. Several mayors had declared an emergency as they distributed ice and generators to those most in need before Thursday’s fire, whose cause was under investigation as officials warned it would take all night to restore power after a transformer blew.  Around 700,000 clients were without power at the height of the outage, and at least 400,000 remained without electricity late Thursday. Many in Puerto Rico had hoped for a quick improvement in service, but clients complain it has gotten even worse in Luma’s first few days of operations – with problems complicated by heavy rains this week followed by the explosion. “This has turned into chaos,” said Javier Jiménez, mayor of the western town of San Sebastián, which had established its own brigade of workers to make repairs after Hurricane Maria largely destroyed the U.S. territory’s electrical grid in 2017, leaving some people without electricity for nearly a year. Jiménez said he was forced to activate that brigade once again this week because Luma Energy, which took over the transmission and distribution system of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority on June 1, told him it did not have enough manpower to restore electricity to the more than 1,000 families left in the dark over the weekend in his town. “I could not believe it,” he said. “A company that has been here just days...” Jiménez also noted that Puerto Ricans have complained that when they call the company, they are placed on hold for hours with no response. A Luma spokeswoman did not return a message for comment, while a company representative, José Pérez, told local radio stations that the outages could be acts of sabotage or instances of too many people using the system at one time. Then on Thursday afternoon, Luma reported that its website became the target of a cyberattack, saying that the 2 million hits per second it was receiving was preventing customers from accessing the site. Government officials have urged patience, noting that Luma inherited thousands of outages and only just took over a system running on rickety infrastructure, much of it patched together after Hurricane Maria. In early June, Luma CEO Wayne Stensby told reporters that the company had more than 350 line workers and that the number was sufficient. On Tuesday, Luma issued a statement urging municipal officials and private contractors to stop trying to fix the system independently, saying that such efforts were illegal and dangerous. “Luma is aware of the outages affecting communities across Puerto Rico and working safely and strategically to restore power across the island,” it said. But many customers are seething, including José Aquino, a 38-year-old gymnastics instructor who said he and his family have been without power for 14 hours at a time on several occasions this week. His father is a diabetic and had to throw away his insulin before buying a small cooler to store it on ice. “He hasn’t had to do that since (Hurricane) Maria,” Aquino said, adding that neither he nor his wife have been able to report the outages to Luma. “They don’t answer.” Luma, a consortium made up of Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston, serves some 1.5 million customers. It will operate the transmission and distribution system under a 15-year contract with Puerto Rico’s government.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-power-outages-business-ef221db81d13ab8206029221d3a551b8,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico probes fire that left 900K clients without power,DÁNICA COTO,6/11/21,"Authorities said Friday they are investigating what sparked a fire at a key substation that plunged 900,000 customers into darkness across Puerto Rico, with thousands still without power. Wayne Stensby, CEO of Luma Energy, which took over transmission and distribution this month for Puerto Rico’s 1.5 million electricity customers, said he expects power to be fully restored by late Friday. He said officials don’t know what caused a transformer to blow on Thursday evening in a secured area monitored by cameras. “We have not located the source of the fault,” he said. “It’s clear that the electrical system here in Puerto Rico is very fragile.” Some 13,000 customers affected by the fire were still without power on Friday, including Gertrudis Calderón, who lives in a working-class neighborhood in the capital of San Juan. While the area has a solar-powered community center that was built after Hurricane Maria razed Puerto Rico’s electrical grid in 2017, she worries about the elderly people in her neighborhood who are bedridden and dependent on oxygen or refrigerated insulin. “They have to pay attention to the infrastructure of less privileged communities because we’re sometimes the most affected,” she said. “We have to think of the elderly.” Luma was already struggling with thousands of outages that affected more than 1 million customers this month before the fire occurred. Some mayors declared states of emergency, saying the company told them it didn’t have sufficient brigades to restore power quickly. Many Puerto Ricans also have criticized Luma, which faced high expectations that problems could be solved immediately despite a decades-old, unstable infrastructure. Many people say they have had problems reporting outages. Hours before the fire, Luma said it was the target of a cyberattack in which its website received 2 million hits per second, preventing customers from accessing it. Some customers like Iván Quiles, who lives in the western mountain town of San Sebastián, said he has given up contacting Luma and calls the mayor directly instead. His sister relies on oxygen to stay alive, and he worries with every outage. “It’s very hard,” he said. “When the lights go out, my biggest concern is my sister’s health.” Stensby, Luma’s CEO, said he doesn’t expect an event like Thursday to occur often: ““I hope yesterday was not normal. This cannot be normal.” Luma, a consortium made up of Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston, will operate the transmission and distribution system of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority under a 15-year contract.",https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-business-caf43f0c694a153ec76819d37e23d9e3,AP,Neutral
US fights ruling to extend SSI benefits to Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,6/8/21,"The federal government filed a brief late Monday to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing Congress has the authority to withhold Supplemental Security Income benefits from U.S. citizens depending on where they live even as President Joe Biden promised to extend those benefits to Puerto Rico. In its 57-page filing, the U.S. Department of Justice urged the Supreme Court to reverse a ruling last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals that stated anyone from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico can apply for the supplemental benefits, which are meant to help elderly, blind and disabled people who struggle financially. An estimated 700,000 people on the island would qualify for the benefits, attorney Hermann Ferre said. The Justice Department argued in its filing that the proper venue for deciding the issue is Congress and not the courts. “It is to Congress that the Constitution has entrusted the power to govern territories and to spend money for the general welfare,” it said. The filing stems from the case of José Luis Vaello Madero, who lived in New York from 1985 until he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013 to care for his wife. He kept receiving the supplemental benefits until told in 2016 that he was ineligible. A year later, the Social Security Administration filed civil action against Vaello, demanding he return more than $28,000 he had received in the benefits while living in Puerto Rico. The benefits are available to any U.S. citizen living in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Mariana Islands, but are denied to those in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. Biden, however, said in a statement that the provision is inconsistent with his administration’s policies and values. “I call on Congress to amend the Social Security Act to extend these benefits to the residents of Puerto Rico. ... There can be no second-class citizens in the United States of America,” he said. Instead of supplemental benefits, Puerto Rico has a program called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled. People can’t make more than $65 a month to qualify, compared with $750 monthly for the Social Security supplemental benefit. The average benefit received under Puerto Rico’s program is $77 a month, compared with $533 with the Social Security program.  More than 40% of the island’s 3.3 million people live in poverty, a rate higher than any U.S. state.",https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-puerto-rico-business-50d85570b479bb41e2efe4a11adf065e,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico under scrutiny as youngest COVID-19 patient dies,DÁNICA COTO,6/8/21,"Puerto Ricans are becoming increasingly disgruntled with how the government is handling the COVID-19 crisis as details emerge, including the death a 29-year-old man who became the U.S. territory’s youngest victim after his father said he wasn’t tested the first two times he sought help at an emergency room. The allegation was made as the government announced Saturday that a private company took responsibility for disconnecting a refrigerated trailer packed with food that was supposed to be distributed to those in need amid a two-month lockdown to curb coronavirus cases, causing chicken, vegetables, fruits and other items to spoil. “This is completely unacceptable,” said Public Safety Director Pedro Janer. He said that while the government will be reimbursed, the incident is under investigation after the company said it received instructions to disconnect the trailer from an employee of a local emergency management office.  The food was left over from when Puerto Rico was hit with a series of strong earthquakes in recent months that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage along the island’s southern coast. Officials did not provide the estimated cost of the food lost. Meanwhile, newly appointed Health Secretary Lorenzo González acknowledged during Saturday’s press conference that the island’s COVID-19 related data is not entirely accurate because some positive cases might have been counted twice, and that the government is working to improve it. “It’s imperfect data, but we’re going to use it...because it’s the one we have,” he said. González said he hopes to eventually make missing data available, including the number of people who have recuperated from COVID-19. Puerto Rico has reported more than 1,100 confirmed cases and more than 1,700 pending test results, with a total of 10,900 tested on an island of 3.2 million, the lowest per capita testing rate compared with any U.S. state. At least 60 deaths have been reported, including that of a 29-year-old man whose father identified him as Joshua James Sánchez and said he had no chronic health conditions. The father, Luis Ángel Sánchez, accused health workers in a social media post of testing and admitting his son only after he went into respiratory failure. “I don’t wish this disastrous experience on anybody,” he said. Sánchez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As a growing number of Puerto Ricans demand more widespread testing, among other things, they have organized drive-by protests and bang on pots every night to signal their displeasure with the administration of Gov. Wanda Vázquez, who has been praised, however, for placing the island on lockdown since March 15. The lockdown is scheduled to expire on May 3, but González said he will recommend it be extended to at least June 1 since the peak of cases isn’t expected until early May.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-caribbean-virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-understanding-the-outbreak-27f1d92836b51dac0b5b386d79b5e1a2,AP,Neutral
Biden follows Trump in defending Puerto Rico benefits exclusion,Lawrence Hurley,6/7/21,"President Joe Biden on Monday said his administration will defend at the U.S. Supreme Court a law that excludes Puerto Rico from a federal program that provides benefits to lowincome elderly, blind and disabled people, adhering to the same policy as his Republican predecessor Donald Trump. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President  Joe Biden departs after delivering an update on his administration's coronavirus disease (COVID19) response in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building's South Court Auditorium at the White House in Washington, U.S. , June 2, 2021. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File PhotoBiden, a Democrat, said in a statement that he opposes the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provision in question but that the Justice Department has a duty to defend it. The justices in March took up a U.S. government appeal originally filed by Trump’s administration of a lower court ruling that found the exclusion unlawful. “This provision is inconsistent with my administration’s policies and values. However, the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of defending the constitutionality of federal statutes, regardless of policy preferences,” Biden said. Biden called on Congress to amend the law so Puerto Ricans would not longer be excluded. The Bostonbased 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year in favor of a Puerto Rican resident named Jose Luis VaelloMadero who had previously received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. The 1st Circuit decided that Puerto Rico’s exclusion from the program violated a provision of the U.S. Constitution that requires that laws apply equally to everyone. The SSI benefits are available to any U.S. citizen living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D. C. , and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. The decision not to include Puerto Rico was made by Congress when it enacted the program in 1972. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding, the Justice Department said in court papers. After Biden took office in January, some advocates urged his administration to drop the appeal as did Jenniffer GonzalezColon, a Republican who is Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress. Many Puerto Ricans have complained that the Caribbean island’s residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens.

Report scrutinizes FCC response in Puerto Rico after Maria,DÁNICA COTO,6/1/21,"A U.S. report released Tuesday found that abstract emergency response guidelines for the Federal Communications Commission could have caused confusion and delays after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2017. The Category 4 storm destroyed 96% of telecommunication cell sites in Puerto Rico after slamming into the island in September 2017, leaving people with no way to call for help, apply for federal assistance or make financial transactions, according to the report published by the Government Accountability Office. It stated that the Department of Homeland Security did not specifically outline what actions the FCC should take to help restore communications infrastructure, and that the agency obtained only limited public input and did not share its actions or findings. The report said such information could help officials build more resilient telecommunication networks and better prepare for future disasters. “As citizens and first responders are increasingly dependent on telecommunications, ensuring the resiliency and reliability of telecommunications networks in U.S. territories may prevent future loss of life,” the GAO said in its report. It noted that Maria, along with Hurricane Irma -- which hit the U.S. Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm about two weeks before Maria – damaged more than 90% of power lines above ground in the three-island territory. The report said the FCC collected information on network outages in Puerto Rico for six months, the longest period in the agency’s history. It also issued nearly 900 special temporary authority licenses to allow radio facilities to operate. But nearly four years after the storms hit, the FCC has not issued a report on its actions or findings or a full account of its response to Hurricane Maria, the GAO found. It added that FCC officials said they were dealing with limited resources given the multiple disasters that occurred in 2017 and 2018. The GAO called on the Department of Homeland Security to define specific emergency response roles and responsibilities for the FCC to avoid confusion in those moments. “During a disaster, there is little time to learn about such technologies and their appropriate use when critical sectors require telecommunications services immediately,” the report stated. The GAO issued its findings more than three months after an inspector general report found that the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump was responsible for stalling about $20 billion in federal funds to help Puerto Rico recover from Maria and also obstructed a probe into the delay.",https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-puerto-rico-49a3ed8979d313f29a53dec46dd0ccbe,AP,Neutral
Private company takes over Puerto Rico power utility service,DÁNICA COTO,6/1/21,"A private company on Tuesday took over the transmission and distribution operations of Puerto Rico’s power authority, which has struggled with blackouts and bankruptcy, corruption and mismanagement. The takeover by Luma Energy under a 15-year contract coincided with the beginning of the Atlantic hurricane season, with many across Puerto Rico worried about the transition and whether the new company can handle a severe storm. The U.S. territory is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, which destroyed most of the power grid in September 2017. “It is extraordinarily fragile and in very poor condition,” warned Wayne Stensby, CEO of Luma, a consortium made up of Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston. However, Stensby said the company, which will serve all of the island’s roughly 1.5 million clients, has enough resources to handle a Category 2 hurricane and can bring in more equipment and workers if a stronger storm hits. The agreement approved by the territory’s government and a federal control board calls for Luma to spend billions of dollars in upgrading the battered system — with most of that money coming from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency — while receiving hundreds of millions of dollars for managing the system. Officials are betting the private operator can do better than the island’s Electric Power Authority, which has struggled to restore the storm-battered electrical grid and keep power flowing while trying to cope with $9 billion in debt — more than that of any other government agency in Puerto Rico. Even with privatization, most analysts expect the government and control board will be forced to agree to an eventual power rate increase to meet the demands of bondholders. Meanwhile, the new company will inherit unresolved blackouts, with more than 30,000 customers left without power in recent weeks. “We don’t wish to go into June 1 with a large backlog of outages, but it’s going to be what it’s going to be,” Stensby said. Puerto Rico chose Luma in June 2020 to operate and modernize the island’s transmission and distribution system. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the company has pledged to reduce power interruptions by 30%, the length of outages by 40% and cut workplace accidents by 50%. “We’ve had a bankrupt ... (and) incompetent public utility for too long,” he said. “The transformation that is underway will make a difference.” But critics have called on the government to cancel the deal. A Texas-based nonprofit, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, complained that Luma would not be penalized for failing to save money or meet renewable energy goals. It said the control board “is turning a blind eye to some of the same fiscal practices that led the commonwealth into bankruptcy,” wrote Tom Sanzillo, the nonprofit’s director of financial analysis. “These include politically driven contracting processes, poorly documented cash transfers between commonwealth entities, lack of clarity and accountability for budgetary savings initiatives, failure to prioritize renewable energy and costly and shortsighted labor management.” The Puerto Rico-based Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan think tank, also criticized the deal, saying, “There are no guarantees that the process to modernize and transform (the electric authority) will be successful.” In addition, some 20 unions representing thousands of Puerto Rican workers ranging from teachers to truck drivers announced on Tuesday that they would go on strike if the Luma contract is not rescinded. Stensby, Luma’s CEO, said he was perplexed by that development: “What are they fighting against? ... How can you fight against better customers service and better electricity?” Meanwhile, the federal board said the effort must go forward. If the Electric Power Authority is not transformed, the economy will shrink, said David Skeel, the board’s chairman. “Some people are not happy with it, but it is the way forward,” he said of the contract. “It is absolutely essential, in my view.” Puerto Rico’s power generation units average 45 years old, twice those of the U.S. mainland, and a fiscal plan approved by the federal board foresees Luma spending some $3.85 billion through fiscal year 2024 to revamp the grid’s transmission and distribution system.",https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-puerto-rico-business-135b9ec52e130f3716f8862021a524d4,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico ends pandemic curfew after a year in force,No Author,5/25/21,"Puerto Rico ended a nightly pandemic curfew Monday after more than a year in force and will allow vaccinated visitors to enter the island without a negative coronavirus test result.

Even when the curfew was sometimes changed, it mostly stayed between midnight and 5 a.m. Arriving visitors who are not vaccinated will still be required to present a negative coronavirus test or promise to offer a test result within 48 hours. The government intends to impose a $300 fine to those who don’t comply with the testing.  But in addition to letting in vaccinated visitors, the government said that beginning Friday it will offer the Johnson and Johnson coronavirus vaccine to anyone who arrives at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan.

"Puerto Rico bond insurer gets split rulings on cash, asset discovery",Maria Chutchian,5/17/21," A bond insurer can access a limited pool of information explaining Puerto Rico's cash position amid ongoing efforts to restructure the commonwealth’s debt stack, but it is not entitled to more information related to the territory's real estate assets right now, a judge ruled on Monday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith Dein issued a pair of written decisions largely rejecting bond insurer Ambac Assuranc Corp's calls for more detailed explanations of Puerto Rico's cash that can be used to pay creditors and real estate properties that could be sold for the benefit of creditors. (Dein works in the Massachusetts federal court but is providing some oversight in the commonwealth's bankruptcylike Title III proceedings.) Her rulings come as the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (FOMB), represented by Proskauer Rose,  continues its efforts to build support  for its proposed debt adjustment plan for the commonwealth, which would reduce $35 billion in public debt to $7.4 billion and restructure more than $50 billion in pension liabilities. Though the board has lined up support from two other major bond insurers, Ambac has not yet signed on to the proposal. Ambac, represented by Milbank, in November requested information surrounding three analyses that break down which of the commonwealth’s cash accounts are restricted – meaning unavailable to pay off creditors – and which are unrestricted. Puerto Rico has about $11.4 billion in unrestricted cash sitting in various accounts, according to court papers filed last week. In one of her two rulings on Monday, Dein held that Ambac  did not prove  that it needs access to socalled process documents showing the evolution of the analyses. Additionally, Dein said, the board already provided information it used to identify accounts as restricted or unrestricted and additional details Ambac seeks is likely protected by attorneyclient privilege. The burden of forcing the oversight board to collect additional documents from its various advisors would outweigh any benefit Ambac would receive, she added. However, Dein granted Ambac's request to access certain materials used to calculate the analyses. The status of the cash accounts, she added, are “clearly” relevant to the proposed plan of debt adjustment. In her  ruling  on Puerto Rico’s real estate properties, Dein held that Ambac offered no legal authority showing that it has the power to designate which properties are available to sell or require the sale of those assets. Ambac has argued that Puerto Rico holds valuable properties that, if sold, could generate more than $1.3 billion that could be used to pay down creditors. Ambac can access information about the properties through publicly available information, she said. “To the extent that Ambac truly believes that appraising specific parcels of real estate and assessing the propriety and likelihood of sale is helpful in these proceedings, nothing herein will prevent its experts from making these determinations from public records as well as from the documents that have already been produced,” Dein wrote. The judge also noted that Ambac will have the opportunity to raise concerns about the commonwealth’s assets when the debt adjustment plan is considered by the court. Atara Miller of Milbank, representing Ambac, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who oversees the majority of the Title III case, is scheduled to hear arguments in July on whether the disclosure materials for the plan are ready to be sent out to creditors for voting purposes. The case is In re Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, No. 1703283.

Grand jury indicts Puerto Rico boxer in lover’s death,DÁNICA COTO,5/6/21,"A grand jury on Thursday indicted Puerto Rican boxer Félix Verdejo in the killing of his pregnant lover, a case potentially eligible for the death penalty. The indictment was announced as dozens of people — some bearing flowers, balloons or small gifts — attended the wake of 27-year-old Keishla Rodríguez, who was reported missing a week ago and whose body was identified on Sunday via dental records.  An FBI complaint, based on testimony from an unidentified witness, accused Verdejo of punching Rodríguez in the face, injecting her with a syringe filled with an unidentified substance bought at a public housing complex, binding her arms and feet with wire, tying a block to her and then throwing her off a bridge at 8:30 a.m. last Thursday. Authorities said Verdejo then stood on the bridge and shot at her body that authorities found in a lagoon near Puerto Rico’s capital on Saturday. “This is a case that has shocked Puerto Rico,” said Carmen Romero, who had traveled roughly an hour from the coastal town of Arecibo to pay her respects. Verdejo, who is married and has a young daughter, turned himself into authorities on Sunday night and is being held without bail. He is accused of kidnapping and carjacking resulting in death and with intentionally killing an unborn child, in addition to using and carrying a firearm during a violent crime. Neither Verdejo nor his attorneys have commented on the case. Also charged in the case is Luis Antonio Cádiz, who on Thursday was ordered held without bail. The victim’s parents said in a press conference at the funeral home that they did not know him, adding that they needed their space and did not want to talk about the case. “What I want is justice for Keishla,” said her mother, Keila Ortiz. “We’re going through a pain that Tony and I never imagined.” The autopsy report has been completed, but authorities said they won’t release details yet on exactly how Rodríguez died because the investigation is ongoing. The victim’s father, José Antonio Rodríguez, told WAPA TV on Wednesday that he is not in favor of the death penalty. “That doesn’t solve anything for me. What’s done is done,” he said. “Let him remember every day who my daughter was.” Verdejo (27-2, 17 knockouts) represented Puerto Rico in the 2012 Olympics and became a professional boxer that year, competing in the lightweight division. Amid growing accusations that Puerto Rico’s government hasn’t done enough to protect women and victims of domestic violence, the island’s justice secretary announced Tuesday that prosecutors will now be required to appear in court for probable cause hearings where a judge rules whether an alleged abuser should be arrested. The announcement comes amid anger over the case of another woman, Andrea Ruiz, who was recently killed and her body set on fire after she filed a domestic violence complaint that a judge dismissed. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi has said that the government failed Ruiz.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-sports-c650ee3da03dc770a501a3c9b1f5b19f,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico groans under pandemic as health, economy suffer",DÁNICA COTO,5/2/21,"Puerto Rico seemed to be sprinting toward herd immunity this spring before people began letting their guard down against COVID-19 and new variants started spreading across the U.S. territory. Now, a spike in cases and hospitalizations has put medical experts at odds with the government, which is struggling to protect people’s health while also trying to prevent an economic implosion on an island battered by hurricanes, earthquakes and a prolonged financial crisis. “The difficulty here is how do you find a Solomonic decision ... to give people the opportunity to work and be responsible and also maintain health as a priority,” said Ramón Leal, former president of Puerto Rico’s Restaurant Association. “These are hard conversations.” It’s a delicate balance for an island that imposed a lockdown and mask mandates ahead of any U.S. state and has some of the strictest entry requirements of any American jurisdiction — measures that helped contain infections before the latest surge. Overall, the land of 3.3 million people has reported more than 115,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, over 115,000 suspected ones and more than 2,000 deaths, with transmission rates inching up the last week of April to 28 cases per 100,000 people a day, compared with 17 per 100,000 on the U.S. mainland. The pandemic has unleashed the second-biggest economic drop Puerto Rico has seen since recordkeeping began in 1980, according to José Caraballo, a Puerto Rico economist. The biggest was caused by Hurricane Maria, which inflicted more than $100 billion in damage in 2017, with nearly 3,000 people dying in its sweltering aftermath. More than 30,000 jobs have been lost because of the COVID-19 outbreak, and at least 1,400 businesses have closed, Caraballo said — this on an island that saw nearly 12% of its population flee in the past decade and whose government is struggling with crushing debt that led it to file for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2017. “I’m taken aback by what the people of Puerto Rico have had to endure,” Caraballo said. Many of those who remain are mourning over lost homes, jobs, businesses or loved ones. Luis Ángel Sánchez has two close friends in the intensive care unit and lost his father and son to COVID-19 in April 2020 less than two weeks apart. Sánchez got vaccinated in mid-March. “The vaccine will not erase the scars or heal my broken heart,” he wrote on Facebook that day. “It will not bring back my son. It will not bring back my father. They, along with the others who have succumbed to this monster will not have died in vain if we continue to do the right thing.” Sánchez said people should keep their guard up and exhorted the government to impose stricter sanctions on those not following COVID-19 measures. “It’s not over yet,” he said. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi has resisted tighter restrictions, saying that another lockdown would be too extreme and that things will keep improving and the island could achieve herd immunity by August: “The solution is vaccination.” More than 2 million doses have been administered on the island, with a robust 55% having received at least one shot and 27% two. While health authorities say they are relieved many are eager to get vaccinated, they note that some people who are not yet fully protected are disregarding restrictions that include a more than yearlong curfew. That and the presence of at least seven COVID-19 variants on the island are believed to be contributing to the rise in cases. Another factor, experts say, is a drop in testing from an average of around 7,000 tests a day to 2,000, a trend blamed on people becoming fixated on getting vaccinated. The fight against COVID-19 has also been complicated by a drain of medical talent to the U.S. mainland.  The number of doctors in Puerto Rico is down to 9,000 from 14,000 in 2006, said Dr. Víctor Ramos, a pediatrician and president of the island’s Association of Surgeons. Similar drops have been seen among nurses and technicians. “Health professionals are exhausted, and they’re scarce,” said Daniel Colón-Ramos, who presides over a scientific coalition that advises Puerto Rico’s governor. Ramos and other health experts say the governor should temporarily ban indoor dining, a measure imposed last year. Currently, restaurants and other places are restricted to 30% capacity, but officials say the limit is hard to gauge and question whether it is even being followed. It’s an issue the government and business owners have clashed over repeatedly, with the industry insisting that it’s safer to eat at a restaurant indoors, given all the safety protocols, than in someone’s house. Mateo Cidre, the owner of four restaurants and bakeries, said the industry has not recovered from the nine weeks last year in which restaurants could only do delivery, carryout or curbside pickup. He suffered heavy losses and applied for a suspension of car and home payments. He criticized the government for not further loosening restrictions even when there has been a drop in cases. “They’ve never been flexible with us,” he said. “It’s been a very tiresome road.” Other industries also have been hit hard, with a $2 billion drop in retail sales last year, said Jorge Argüelles, former president of Puerto Rico’s Retail Association.  Those being squeezed by the restrictions say the governor should impose tighter restrictions at the airports, where only about 30% of those arriving carry the required negative COVID-19 test. Several tourists have been arrested for lashing out at authorities after refusing to follow health instructions. A voluntary, 14-day confinement option was lifted on Wednesday, and those who don’t have a negative test face a $300 fine if they don’t present one within 48 hours. However, there is no system to fine them on arrival; it is up to people to voluntarily fill out a document online later so that they can be fined. “The thing I’m most anxious about,” said Colón-Ramos, who oversees the scientific council, “is thinking that there are people alive today who can be saved or can die depending on how Puerto Ricans behave.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-economy-business-financial-markets-pandemics-86591ae020b9ea4c117a1364661e5a1e,AP,Neutral
US tourist killed in Puerto Rico after no-photo warning,DÁNICA COTO,4/27/21,"The burned body of a 24-year-old tourist from Delaware was identified on Tuesday, three days after he and a friend were attacked following a drug purchase in a seaside San Juan district popular with visitors, Puerto Rico police said. Police Commissioner Antonio López Figueroa said Tariq Quadir Loat and a friend had purchased unspecified drugs in the shantytown of La Perla and were trying to take photographs after being warned not to. Police said the two were beaten with items including an exercise weight, a piece of wood and a deep fryer on Saturday. Loat disappeared and his friend James Jackson managed to flee, but was then hospitalized with injuries. Police said Loat’s body was found Sunday in the town of Vega Baja, about 20 miles west of San Juan, and was identified by fingerprints. The attackers have not yet been identified. It’s rare for tourists to be killed in Puerto Rico, an island of 3.3 million people that last saw a record number of killings nearly a decade ago. The last tourist to be reported killed was a 39-year-old man from Denver, Colorado, who police say was thrown from an SUV and run over in San Juan in February 2020. La Perla was once a dangerous slum controlled by rival drug gang and considered Puerto Rico’s biggest distribution point for heroin. But that reputation has largely faded, especially since it was used as the backdrop for the video of “Despacito,” a song released in 2017 by Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Hundreds of tourists have since visited La Perla, where criminal activity was greatly reduced after a 2011 raid by federal agents.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-puerto-rico-242f33ea8102ca924ba05107a5e7bd51,AP,Neutral
Ex Puerto Rico justice secretary charged in government probe,No Author,4/26/21,"Authorities charged a former Puerto Rico justice secretary with ethical violations and obstruction of justice Monday in a case involving an ex-governor of the U.S. territory. Wandymar Burgos faces a $15,000 bond and a preliminary hearing in early June. She was suspended from her job as an assistant government attorney for the civil affairs office within the island’s Justice Department. Burgos’ attorney declined comment to reporters. Burgos served as justice secretary for about a week before resigning last July amid strong criticism. Before stepping down, she had identified herself as the person who recalled files that were about to be delivered to Puerto Rico’s Special Independent Prosecutor’s Panel for further investigation. One of those files named then Gov. Wanda Vázquez.  The files were part of an investigation into the alleged mismanagement of disaster supplies following a series of strong earthquakes. The probe had been recommended by another justice secretary whom Vázquez asked to resign, with Burgos taking over the position. Vázquez at the time denied that the move was out of alleged retribution as she defended Burgos’ actions, adding that they were not wrong or illegal and that the investigation against her was rigged. Vázquez, who is not charged in the case, lost in the November general elections. The special prosecutor’s panel on Monday referred Vázquez and several other government officials including a former chief of staff, to the Office of Government Ethics for further investigation into alleged ethical violations.

Scholars study why so many died after Puerto Rico hurricane,No Author,4/22/21,"Researchers said Thursday they are launching a survey of the causes of deaths in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria to clear up questions about why the toll of the 2017 Category 4 storm was so high. Studies by George Washington University found an estimated 2,975 excess deaths in the six months in Puerto Rico following Maria — far above the initial official death counts reported by a government that struggled to keep track of those dying, including many elderly in nursing homes without power. The university’s new study, in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico, will survey nearly 1,700 people who might have information on those who died and why. Analysts have suggested that power outages, building failures and damaged roads contributed to increased deaths after the storm. The university said results of the survey will be accompanied by recommendations on how to improve building codes and other standards that could prevent future deaths or injuries.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-puerto-rico-f500b09dcb670d12c4c185fd24017eca,AP,Neutral
Alaska GOP lawmaker advocates for Puerto Rico statehood,No Author,4/17/21,"Alaska Republican Rep. Don Young has advocated for Puerto Rico statehood, a decision that defies fellow party members across the country and state. Young said on Wednesday that the island’s statehood was long overdue. “I think it’s time,” Young said. “As far as the plebiscites, we’ve had three of them. Each time we’ve actually been victorious, in the sense of being a state.” The most recent plebiscite, or non-binding vote, on the island was in November. More than 52% of Puerto Ricans voted for statehood. But statehood requires congressional approval in order to happen. Puerto Rico statehood scares many Republicans, who have said that it could ensure Democratic leadership in the Senate for decades, Alaska Public Media reported. Rep. Young said the partisan voting patterns of Puerto Rico’s electorate should not determine whether the island qualifies for statehood. Young referred to the fights by Alaska and Hawaii for statehood, which occurred in 1959. He said Alaska was predicted to send almost exclusively Democratic representatives to Congress while Hawaii was expected to send all Republicans. “I have some opposition on my side about, ‘they’ll all be Democrats.’ They said the same thing about Alaska and now we’re all Republicans,” Young said. “So, everybody has the right to decide what they’re going to be, but don’t pre-think what they’re going to be because it doesn’t work out that way.” In the last few decades, Alaska has mostly sent Republicans to Washington while Hawaii has mostly sent Democrats. Young had sponsored the only Puerto Rico statehood bill to ever pass the U.S. House in 1998. “I’m proud of that,” Young said. Fourteen other House Republicans had joined him as sponsors of the most current Puerto Rico statehood bill.",https://apnews.com/article/alaska-puerto-rico-don-young-bd0acb7fb26e8728ee9b8ebcf21f2d75,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to shutter schools amid spike in COVID-19 cases,No Author,4/9/21,"Puerto Rico’s health secretary announced Thursday that all public and private schools in the U.S. territory would close for two weeks amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. The closures would go into effect April 12, roughly a month after some 100 of the island’s 858 public schools were authorized to reopen for the first time in a year amid the pandemic. Only kindergarteners, special education students and children in first, second, third and 12th grades were allowed to return to school. They attend in-person classes only twice a week and are dismissed before noon, with school cafeterias remaining closed. The announcement was praised by some health experts, teachers and parents who worried about an increase in infections and had warned that reopening schools was a rushed decision. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said that while no COVID-19 breakouts were identified at any of the schools, the move is necessary given the recent spike in cases. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 200,000 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 2,000 deaths. More than 1 million vaccines have been administered since inoculations began in December, and starting on April 12, all those 16 years and older can be vaccinated. Currently, only those 35 to 49 years old with chronic health conditions are authorized to receive a vaccine, along with all those 50 and older.",https://apnews.com/article/health-puerto-rico-education-coronavirus-pandemic-latin-america-4c883b1d173ece744690843fba5c07de,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to open vaccinations to all amid COVID-19 spike,DÁNICA COTO,4/8/21,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Wednesday that officials will start vaccinating all those 16 and older beginning Monday, prompting celebrations across a U.S. territory facing a spike in COVID-19 cases. Currently, only people 50 years and older as well as anyone 35 to 49 with chronic health conditions are authorized to receive a vaccine. More than 1 million vaccines have been administered since inoculations on the island of 3.2 million began in December. “We continue to face a terrible pandemic, along with the entire world, and its consequences have been enormous,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. During his first state of the territory address, Pierluisi also announced he would implement more stringent measures to fight a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. A curfew that has remained in place for more than a year was expanded again and will run from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. starting Friday. In addition, businesses will be forced to close by 9 p.m., two hours earlier than currently allowed. “Unfortunately, as in many other jurisdictions, we are seeing a dangerous spike in COVID cases that has caused a rise in hospitalizations and deaths,” he said. Pierluisi also announced that his administration would assign $20 million to establish a genomics surveillance program in the island’s Health Department to help officials monitor coronavirus variants and possible mutations. He said he also will set aside $1.5 million to create a digital vaccine passport, adding that people’s personal information would be protected. Details on the proposed passport were not immediately available. The upcoming changes come as Puerto Rico reports more than 199,000 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 2,000 deaths. Pierluisi praised the U.S. government for treating Puerto Rico fairly as he announced the island is slated to receive millions of additional dollars in federal funds to help those affected by the pandemic. At least $50 million would go to the restaurant and bar industry, which has been hit hard by ongoing restrictions to fight the coronavirus. Bars in Puerto Rico have not been allowed to reopen for more than a year. Another $50 million would go to help clinics and private hospitals, and the same amount would be set aside for agricultural workers. Pierluisi also announced that $250 million would be distributed as part of a special payment to first responders, nurses, medical technicians and others in the health sector who have put their lives at risk. During the roughly hourlong address, Pierluisi made numerous other pledges, including securing statehood for Puerto Rico, improving potable water service to needy communities and building a new hospital in the nearby island of Vieques after Hurricane Maria in 2017 damaged the former one, which remains shuttered. Those pledges were dismissed by legislators of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, who noted that Puerto Rico has been mired in a serious economic crisis for more than a decade and one deepened by hurricanes, a string of recent earthquakes and the pandemic as it tries to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt load. “He offered a message of dreams while the island lives a nightmare,” said José Luis Dalmau, president of Puerto Rico’s Senate. Pierluisi also stressed he would not cancel a contract to privatize the transmission and distribution of power currently run by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority. The contract has come under increased scrutiny amid concerns including what would happen to the thousands of government employees who work there.  Puerto Rico Rep. Rafael Hernández, also of the opposition Popular Democratic Party, said he was disappointed by that pronouncement and said he had hoped the governor would postpone the contract to study it more closely.",https://apnews.com/article/health-puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-pedro-pierluisi-39f12f1d02647e0051eea2dab43c702d,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico vaccinates thousands in 15-hour mass event,No Author,3/31/21,"Thousands of people were vaccinated against COVID-19 on Wednesday as part of a mass inoculation event in Puerto Rico’s capital that was scheduled to last 15 hours. It was the first event of its kind since the U.S. territory began vaccinating people in mid-December.  Officials hoped to vaccinate 10,000 people with the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot during the event that would run from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. By late Wednesday afternoon, more than 5,000 vaccines were given, according to Health Secretary Carlos Mellado. For now, Puerto Rico is vaccinating only those 35- to 49-years-old with chronic health conditions and all those 50 years and older, along with all workers in the food and telecommunications industries, among others. Wednesday’s event was meant only for people who qualified and made an appointment, but Mellado said someone sent a fake message via social media claiming that all those 21 years and older could show up without an appointment. Hundreds did so, and some of them were vaccinated amid grumbling from those who had an appointment and were waiting in line. More than 1 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S. territory of 3.2 million people.

Report: Military cleanup in Puerto Rico islands slow-going,DÁNICA COTO,3/26/21,"The reopening of hiking trails and various white-sand beaches on two tiny Puerto Rican islands long used as Navy bombing ranges and now popular with tourists will be delayed more than a decade, according to a federal report released Friday. Cleanup efforts in Vieques and Culebra led respectively by the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will continue through 2032 at an additional cost of $420 million for a total of $800 million, stated the U.S. Government Accountability Office. “Substantial work remains,” the report stated. “Challenges include logistics, the islands’ topography and environment, and the safety concerns around handling unexploded munitions. The Navy also faces challenges on Vieques with community distrust of the military handling cleanup efforts.” So far, crews have removed munition including 32,000 bombs, 12,000 grenades and 1,300 rockets from Vieques, where the U.S. government relocated residents when the Navy began using the island as a training range in the 1940s. Meanwhile, crews have cleared more than 5,000 unexploded ordnances since January 2020 in Culebra, where the military ceased all activities in 1975. An unknown number of munitions remains on both islands located just east of Puerto Rico as teams use tools ranging from machetes to drones to help clean the area. In addition, the Navy identified perchlorate in the groundwater in at least one site in Vieques, where it operated a training range on 14,500 acres until its closure in 2001. The area was later designated as a Superfund site believed to contain mercury, lead, napalm, depleted uranium and other contaminants. The GAO said that substantial work remains to be done in one site that covers some 11,500 acres underwater and extends from Vieques’ shoreline to a depth of 10 to 15 feet. Meanwhile, cleanup at 14 of 15 former military sites in Culebra will continue through fiscal year 2031, the agency said. The report noted, however, that the U.S. Navy expects some 5,000 acres in Vieques might open by 2021 for hiking and other activities. Overall, the report’s findings are a disappointment to many of those who live in Vieques and Culebra and to Puerto Rico’s government, whose robust tourism sector represents only 7 percent of the U.S. territory’s economy but has remained afloat despite a more than decade-long economic crisis. The beaches that are open in Vieques and Culebra attract tens of thousands of tourists a year, and officials were hoping to increase that number. According to the GAO report, “(federal) officials told us that the beaches and coastlines present a challenge because some beaches, for example, are open to the public, and closures need to be coordinated with local officials, potentially affecting tourism.” A couple of locals and tourists have been injured across the years by live munition, including a young girl who was burned after picking up an old shell that contained white phosphorous. Police at the time said officials found six live bombs near the shell. Another challenge to cleanup efforts is the weather, with officials stating that crews have to sometimes resurvey sites to ensure that a hurricane did not push munitions into a previously cleared site. The cleanup, in addition to the longtime presence of contaminants on both islands, have angered many locals who blame the U.S. government for their health problems. The Navy has agreed to limit controlled burns to two acres a day, and it expects to start using a closed detonation chamber late this year, something that locals had been requesting for a decade, the GAO said. The new mayor of Vieques, José Corcino, did not return messages for comment. The U.S. government has said that past military actions and ongoing cleanup efforts pose no risk, but many have disputed those findings. Last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded a grant to the University of Massachusetts-Boston to launch a three-year assessment of environmental health risks in Vieques.",https://apnews.com/article/us-news-hiking-army-puerto-rico-bombings-816e653d04dc9e88599d37fdcb7da5d8,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico cracks down on tourists flouting pandemic rules,DÁNICA COTO,3/24/21,"They come from New York, Illinois, Michigan, and authorities say too many of the tourists are flouting Puerto Rico’s pandemic health measures, including the mask mandate, the nightly curfew and a requirement to stay in isolation pending coronavirus tests. So officials are cracking down, with nearly a dozen visitors arrested over the past six days.  They include three men from New York who were not wearing face masks and got into an argument with a teenager while visiting a popular beach on the island’s northeast coast, authorities said Tuesday. But most of the arrests have been been in the San Juan metropolitan area, and a couple of tourists remain in jail.  Charges range from assaulting police officers to lying on their traveler’s declaration form, which carries a punishment of three years in prison if found guilty. The lies include falsely promising to honor the required quarantine if someone fails to present a negative coronavirus test upon arrival or agreeing to get tested after landing, said Damarisse Martínez, a spokeswoman for the island’s Justice Department. An average of about 10,000 to 12,000 people have flown into Puerto Rico daily this month, and only about 30% have presented a negative test, according to statistics from the island’s health department. By law, those who do not present a negative test have to remain in isolation for two weeks, until they get tested in a local laboratory and receive a negative result. Last week, officials pledged to increase the number of police officers in popular tourist areas and allow access only to residents in certain neighborhoods as the midnight curfew approaches. That was in response to widespread anger over the behavior of some visitors who, like some local people as well, have flagrantly violated pandemic measures. “After months of complaints, we finally see that action is being taken,” said Joaquín Bolívar, president of the board of directors of Puerto Rico’s Association of Hotels and Tourism. While tourism represents only about 7% of the island’s economy, it was considered one of its strongest sectors prior to the pandemic, drawing a record number of cruise ship passengers. Puerto Rico never closed its main international airport amid the pandemic despite requests sent to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to bar flights from COVID-19 hotspots. The U.S. territory, however, did close all its other airports to better control and monitor incoming people. Bars across Puerto Rico have remained closed for more than a year, though restaurants were recently allowed to increase capacity to 50%. Face masks are mandatory, and a midnight-5 a.m. curfew is in place. Beaches were reopened in September to everyone. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 189,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths related to COVID-19. The island’s government recently relaxed health measures because the number of cases had been falling, although Health Secretary Carlos Mellado warned on Tuesday that there’s been an uptick.",https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-health-san-juan-coronavirus-pandemic-puerto-rico-242aba26e41f08d17cbff4b6d8c2bcb2,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico awarded $900M to help boost island’s education,DÁNICA COTO,3/22/21,"Puerto Rico’s government on Monday was granted access to more than $900 million in federal education funds less than two weeks after reopening dozens of public and private schools for the first time since the pandemic began. The $912 million is available immediately, but the U.S. Department of Education will work with Puerto Rico officials to identify how the money would be used to address the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of students in the U.S. territory, according to a spokeswoman for Jenniffer González, the island’s congressional representative. Further details, including whether the money could be used to buy things including computers or face masks, were not immediately available. Officials with Puerto Rico’s education department did not return a message for comment. The money comes as Puerto Rico struggles to recover and rebuild from the 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria and a string of strong earthquakes that began in late 2019 and destroyed or damaged dozens of schools in the island’s southern region. Then the pandemic hit, forcing hundreds of private and public schools to close for nearly a year as teachers and students alike struggled with power outages and spotty or nonexistent internet connections amid virtual learning. “Our students have been through too much,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “They deserve a semblance of normalcy.” Pierluisi authorized the reopening of certain public and private schools this month to some students, but scarce attendance was reported amid fears of contagion as less than 100 of Puerto Rico’s 858 public schools reopened nearly two weeks ago for the first time in a year. For now, only kindergarteners, special education students and children in first, second, third and 12th grades are allowed to return to school. They attend in-person classes only twice a week and are dismissed before noon. The release of federal education funds comes as Puerto Rico pursues a new relationship with the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, with local officials hopeful that funding delays common under the former Trump administration will dissipate. “The department understands the urgency to access vital federal education funds to meet the needs of Puerto Rican students who are experiencing compounded trauma,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.",https://apnews.com/article/us-news-health-coronavirus-pandemic-puerto-rico-education-e46c32b58a129a9ad0a87978a35b00c4,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to reopen historic church after long restoration,DÁNICA COTO,3/12/21,"The construction worker stood on his tiptoes and tried to arrange a crown of thorns on a statue of Jesus while architect Jorge Rigau fired a flurry of directions from beneath the ladder. “Grab it like this and move it just a bit,” he said, motioning with his fingers. “Move it to the right, but don’t lower it.” It was one of the final touches on a detailed restoration of the second oldest surviving Spanish church in the Americas, whose construction had begun by 1532 on land donated by famous explorer Juan Ponce de León and whose base was erected atop an Indigenous settlement. The church was built for a Dominican convent where the renowned Spanish priest Bartolomé de las Casas once lived, served as shelter during an attack by the Indigenous Taínos, became Puerto Rico’s first high school and was damaged by a cannonball during the 1898 Spanish-American War in which Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the U.S. But the San José Church — surpassed in age only by the Spanish cathedral in the neighboring Dominican Republic — was shuttered in 1996 due to serious deterioration. San Juan’s own cathedral dates to 1521, but the original wooden building was destroyed and the current structure dates to 1540. The $11 million restoration became a personal project for businessman Ricardo González that took nearly two decades to complete. Many thought it would fail due to funding problems, the lack of an original blueprint to provide guidance and widespread deterioration including termites, pigeon droppings and tree roots that had pierced the church’s Gothic-style nave whose ribbed vault was once described as “a grand accomplishment rarely seen outside Europe.” González, who is active in the Catholic Church, volunteered to help oversee its reconstruction in the early 2000s with permission from Msgr. Roberto González, the archbishop of San Juan. He figured it would take one year to complete. But as workers probed with radar and laser technology and physically peeled away the church’s layers, they uncovered centuries-old murals and architectural techniques once used by the Romans. Ricardo González realized he faced a deep and lengthy restoration process. “When we started on that, there was no turning back,” he said. In 2009, he founded the Patronage of Monuments of San Juan, Inc. to raise more funds for the project. Donations ranged from a couple of quarters to large amounts given by businesses, nonprofit organizations and wealthy Puerto Ricans. Actor Benicio del Toro joined the pleas for donations as the building was added to the 11 most endangered historic places listed by the U.S. National Trust for Historic Preservation. For years, tourists and locals had all but given up on being able to once again visit the site. On a recent visit to the church, González’s eyes teared up. “Every day I walk through there and get emotional,” he said as he stood on the roof and gestured at the building. “I’ve seen the movie, you know?” It began, he said, with National Park Service experts showing construction workers how to use lime in accordance with the church’s original workmanship. Workers then had to chip away the concrete that covered the walls of the nearly 17,000-square-foot church bit by bit, in tiny sections to avoid damaging what might be below. Later, experts were hired from abroad to restore murals and other art, including armored mermaids painted in the corners of one chapel. The renovation was halted only three times in nearly 20 years: briefly after 2017′s Hurricane Maria, during last year’s pandemic lockdown and in 2008, when the lime supplier temporarily ran out of material. Rather than face that problem again, González decided the workers — many of them from the Dominican Republic — would learn how to make their own lime, a lengthy process that requires aging the mixture. Instead of horsehair once used to help bind such material, González opted for strips of fiberglass.  They shunned the easier but less authentic concrete used during a prior restoration. “The cement does not allow the walls to breathe,” he said, noting that humidity played a role in the deterioration of the church, which was built near the ocean atop an Indian settlement at the highest point of San Juan’s historic district, known as Old San Juan. The church and its walls have survived a lot over the centuries, said Archbishop González, who is not related to the businessman. “It’s a wonder,” he said as he scanned the church while sitting on one of the pews that will be used for Masses after the opening on March 19. Restorers intentionally left the church’s history exposed in some areas: centuries-old, clay-colored walls and columns as well as faded murals and a niche that once served as the original confessional. A slightly elevated line inside the church’s entrance outlines the shape of the original roof. The restorers framed the area where the cannonball hit during the 1898 war. “We let the church talk to you,” Rigau said, adding that visitors “will find witnesses, ghosts, memories, scars.” But at least one mystery remains. All the figures depicted on the church’s gilded altar have been identified except for one: a woman with flaxen hair in the upper left-hand corner holding a palm frond, which indicates she was a martyr, but offers no other clues.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-san-juan-ceb616b5778c04c1f2af88bbd380cb50,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico debt-restructuring plan filed amid criticism,DÁNICA COTO,3/10/21,"A framework that outlines how Puerto Rico will restructure at least $35 billion in public debt and more than $50 billion in public pension liabilities threatens a 10% cut to certain public pensions if no agreement is reached with retirees. The amended plan of adjustment of 233 pages was filed late Monday in U.S. court by a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances and was created by Congress to lift the U.S. territory’s government out of bankruptcy. The plan includes a proposed cut of up to 8.5% to monthly pensions of at least $1,500. That has long been a point of contention between the board and the governor, who has repeatedly said he would not approve such cuts. Board Chairman David Skeel called the plan “a milestone for Puerto Rico’s recovery, stability, and prosperity. This plan substantially reduces the burden of debt payments on future generations, stabilizes and protects pensions that have been mismanaged for so long, and affirms the collective bargaining agreements of government workers.” The board said that if the proposed pension cut is rejected, it would return to the original proposal of imposing a 10% cut on monthly pensions of at least $1,000. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi issued a statement saying the plan was a great step in helping end the debt-restructuring process. “Puerto Rico needs to leave this bankruptcy process behind in order to achieve the sustainable economic development to which we all aspire and eliminate the uncertainty inherent in this process, as well as the million-dollar restructuring expenses that the government has had to incur,” he said. But Pierluisi noted the government will state in court that it does not wholly support the plan. “My administration has been emphatic that this pension cut is not reasonable,” he said. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico economist José Caraballo said the plan had positive and negative aspects and recommended that the governor negotiate with the board to protect pensions up to $2,000 and then impose a 10% cut on anything higher. “You have to seek a little flexibility,” he said in a phone interview. Caraballo said he supports the plan’s call to create a pension reserve trust, noting that pensions are currently paid by tax revenues. He also agrees that the amount of money bondholders would receive is to be contingent on the ups and downs of government revenue flows. However, he worries that creditors would be paid what he considers an excessive amount. “Practically 30% of Puerto Rico’s budget will go toward paying retirees and bondholders,” he said, adding that the island’s legislature could be a game changer because it would have to approve the issuance of new bonds as outlined in the plan. “That’s where we could see a roadblock.” Ultimately, the plan also has to be approved by a judge overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy-like process. If that occurs, the plan would reduce Puerto Rico’s outstanding debt from $35 billion to $7.4 billion, an 80% cut. Among other things, it also would cut total debt service payments by more than 60%, which the board said would save the government nearly $60 billion in debt service payments. The board said the amended plan has “substantial” support from creditors, including from those who hold more than $13 billion worth of bonds. “This diverse group of stakeholders agrees that it is time to move on, to heal, to build, and to grow this economy,” said Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director. “Bankruptcy has taken a huge toll on the people of Puerto Rico.” The amended plan was filed nearly six years after the U.S. territory declared it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load, an amount accumulated following decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing to balance budgets. In 2017, the island filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history. That same year, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage.",https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-puerto-rico-latin-america-b69cb49d9db1fd25dae5c838d25c9b42,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico reopens public schools amid COVID-19 fears,DÁNICA COTO,3/10/21,"Parents across Puerto Rico knelt down on Wednesday to adjust their children’s face masks and backpacks as public schools reopened for the first time in nearly a year despite the pandemic, with officials reporting scarce attendance amid COVID-19 concerns. The hugs outside schools were followed by a temperature check and a dollop of hand sanitizer at some of the 96 of the U.S. territory’s 858 public schools authorized to reopen because they were located in a municipality with a low number of coronavirus cases and had met a list of requirements issued by Puerto Rico’s Health Department. Among them was the Ramón Marín Solá primary school in Guaynabo, where parents checked their children’s face masks before hugging them goodbye. “You can’t touch it,” a man told his young son who was tugging at his mask.  “It itches, it itches a lot,” his son replied as he walked into the school for the first time as a kindergartner. For now, only kindergarteners, special education students and children in first, second, third and 12th grades are allowed to return to school. They will attend in-person classes only twice a week and be dismissed before noon, with school cafeterias remaining closed, although there is a “grab-and-go” option. In-person attendance is not obligatory, and remote classes were still being offered. “It was important to have in-person education once again, even if it’s little by little,” Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said. Of the 100 students at the Ramón Marín Solá school who were allowed to return to class, only about 30 showed up despite confirmation from the parents of 75 children, officials said. Among them was Luzceli Rivera’s 6-year-old son. “This is something we have to learn to live with,” she said after dropping him off, adding that she had no qualms about sending him back to school because he had a strict teacher. Rivera and her husband were previously infected with the coronavirus, along with one of their three sons, but not the one who was returning to class: “He knows he has to keep the mask on.” The schools that reopened Monday were located in about 50 of the U.S. territory’s 78 municipalities, with openings and closures expected to fluctuate in upcoming weeks depending on the number of coronavirus cases in a specific municipality and whether any infections are reported at a school. Union leaders and some parents and teachers have called on Pierluisi’s administration to wait until August to reopen schools, noting the U.S. territory has not seen a significant decrease in COVID-19 cases. Sheila Mercado, a Spanish teacher at a school that has not yet been authorized to reopen, said she feels the reopening has been rushed. “They have had an entire year to get schools into shape,” she said. “Eventually, one has to return to the classroom because we’re not going to remain like this all our lives...but they glossed over this plan.” The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 180,700 confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases and more than 2,000 deaths. As of Sunday, more than 607,000 people have been vaccinated, with nearly 227,000 already having received the second dose.",https://apnews.com/article/us-news-health-coronavirus-pandemic-puerto-rico-education-7604309c539a45e35e646cfec46700a3,AP,Neutral
Officials seeking answers to Puerto Rico telescope collapse,DÁNICA COTO,3/5/21,"The National Science Foundation said Friday that it could cost up to $50 million just to clean up the debris at a renowned radio telescope that collapsed last year in Puerto Rico, adding that investigations into what caused its cables to fail are still ongoing.  The update is part of a report that the federal agency, which owns the telescope, had to submit to Congress as the investigation continues into the Arecibo telescope. It was until recently the world’s largest radio telescope and was used to study pulsars, detect gravitational waves, search for neutral hydrogen and detect habitable planets, among other things. The NSF noted that results from the forensic evaluations by engineering firms, including mapping the distribution of debris, won’t be ready until late this year. In addition, the NSF said it asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to launch an independent and expedited study into what caused the telescope to collapse. “Ensuring safety has continued to be the NSF’s top priority,” the report stated. “This includes not only the safety of personnel on the site, but also the safety of the environment in the area and the need to address concerns about historic and cultural preservation.” Estimated cleanup costs range from $30 million to $50 million, with crews so far sampling soil and excavating areas contaminated by hydraulic oil. The telescope is located in Puerto Rico’s karst region, which serves as an important water source and contains the island’s richest biodiversity.  The NSF said officials also plan to analyze soil and water and prevent sediment and pollutants from migrating. Meanwhile, the University of Central Florida, which manages the telescope, is charged with screening the debris to identify any equipment that could be reused or possibly displayed at the site or at another museum. “All scientific infrastructure that can be utilized is being saved,” the NSF said. The federal agency said it’s still evaluating whether to repair any damaged technology that could be saved. Some technologies are still in use, including two LIDAR facilities used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research such as analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data. The dish was damaged in August when an auxiliary cable snapped and caused a 100-foot gash on the dish, breaking about 250 of the dish’s 40,000 aluminum reflector panels and damaging the receiver platform that hung above it.  Then in early November, a main cable broke, with engineers warning that further cable failure would likely be catastrophic. A month later, the telescope’s 900-ton receiver platform and the Gregorian dome — a structure as tall as a four-story building that houses secondary reflectors — fell more than 400 feet onto the dish. It was a crushing event for scientists around the world who had been using the telescope for nearly six decades.",https://apnews.com/article/technology-puerto-rico-philanthropy-latin-america-a863462e500d67a65d9a57fbc7c1ff4c,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor to meet with Biden team on Wednesday - White House official,Trevor Hunnicutt,3/2/21,"Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi will meet with top Biden administration officials on Wednesday for discussions to focus on economic development, disaster relief and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, a White House official said. Pierluisi will meet virtually with officials including White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the director of the administration’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and domestic policy official Carmel Martin, the official said. It was not clear whether the administration would address the territory’s referendum last year expressing a preference for statehood or a move by some members of Congress toward that goal. AdvertisementPierluisi is an advocate for Puerto Rican statehood. Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the Caribbean island’s residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the mostpopulous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people. Biden previously promised to engage with Puerto Ricans who have a range of opinions on statehood. A spokeswoman for Pierluisi did not respond to a request for comment. Faith leaders have also been pressing Biden to withdraw a lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump’s administration to block $2. 3 billion in supplemental income payments to some 300,000 aged, blind and disabled Puerto Ricans. The U.S. Supreme Court decided on Monday to agree to hear the case. A hearing is likely in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2022.

Supreme Court to weigh Puerto Rico access to US aid,No Author,3/1/21,"The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether it is unconstitutional to exclude people living in Puerto Rico from Supplemental Social Security Income. The justices said they would hear an appeal, first filed by the Trump administration, of a lower-court ruling that held that residents of the U.S. territory should have the same access to SSI benefits as older, disabled and blind Americans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The administration argues that a pair of 40-year-old Supreme Court decisions already upheld the federal law that created SSI and excluded Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories from it. Congress later added in the Mariana Islands. In recent months, a federal judge ruled that Puerto Rico residents should have access to other federal welfare benefits from which they have been excluded as well. A federal judge in Guam said residents of that Pacific island also should be able to collect SSI. A separate program, Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, covers residents of the territories, but it has more stringent eligibility requirements and pays less generous benefits than SSI.",https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-puerto-rico-ssi-benefits-b0b96a610a1b9f9e68f2283029c2aade,AP,Neutral
U.S. Supreme Court to examine Puerto Rico's exclusion from benefits program,Lawrence Hurley,3/1/21,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide the legality of a decadesold congressional decision to exclude Puerto Rico from a federal program that provides benefits to lowincome elderly, blind and disabled people. Slideshow ( 2 images )The justices took up a U.S. government appeal originally filed by Republican former President Donald Trump’s administration of a lower court ruling that found the exclusion unlawful. Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the Caribbean island’s residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the mostpopulous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people. The Bostonbased 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year in favor of a Puerto Rican resident named Jose Luis VaelloMadero who had previously received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. The 1st Circuit decided that Puerto Rico’s exclusion from the program violated a provision of the U.S. Constitution that requires that laws apply equally to everyone. VaelloMadero, who is 66 years old and disabled, mounted his constitutional challenge after the government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for payments it had made to him after he moved to Puerto Rico. The SSI benefits are available to any U.S. citizen living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D. C. , and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. The decision not to include Puerto Rico was made by Congress when it enacted the program in 1972. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding, the Justice Department said in court papers. After Democratic President Joe Biden took office in January, some religious groups urged his administration to drop the appeal. [L1N2KM1J8]Jenniffer GonzalezColon, a Republican who is Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress, said in a statement that Biden should “do the right thing and withdraw the case. ” GonzalezColon has introduced legislation that would extend the SSI program to Puerto Rico and the other territories. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Puerto Rico asked the Supreme Court to uphold the 1st Circuit ruling. “United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico enjoy much lesser rights than those who reside in the States merely because of Puerto Rico’s status as a territory,” Puerto Rico’s government said in court papers. “This inequality is both unconstitutional and unacceptable. ”The court is likely to hear and decide the case in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2022.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-puertorico-idUSKCN2AT320,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico rejects key deal with creditors to reduce debt,DÁNICA COTO,2/23/21,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Tuesday that a federal control board reached a key deal that would reduce the U.S. territory’s overall debt by nearly 80%, but that his administration is rejecting it amid concerns about cuts to the island’s crumbling public pension system. The impasse between the governor and a board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances threatens to throw into limbo attempts to end a bankruptcy-like process for a government that six years ago declared unpayable its more than $70 billion public debt load. The deal was reached with creditors who hold general obligation bonds and Public Building Authority bonds sold by Puerto Rico’s government and would resolve $35 billion worth of debt and non-debt claims, according to the board. It also would reduce debt held by those creditors from $18.8 billion to $7.4 billion, a 61% reduction, and would provide them with $7.4 billion in bonds and $7 billion in cash, among other things. The board said the deal would free up more than $300 million a year for government services, and that instead of the 30 cents for every dollar in taxes and fees that Puerto Rico’s government collects that once went to creditors, it would be less than 8 cents. “It will set Puerto Rico on the path to end bankruptcy,” said board chairman David Skeel. “We think this is a very, very big moment in Puerto Rico’s recovery.” Gov. Pedro Pierluisi disagreed. He said in a statement that while the agreement is positive in many ways for Puerto Rico, his administration does not back the deal that is scheduled to be submitted in court next month and requires final approval from a federal judge overseeing the bankruptcy-like process. “The plan of adjustment should not be structured in a way that affects our pensioners even more,” he said. Pierluisi added that finalizing the restructuring of a portion of Puerto Rico’s debt is a priority for his administration, but not at the expense of retirees: “Putting the bankruptcy process behind us is a fundamental step toward the recovery and economic development of our island.” Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director, said she understood the governor’s concerns but added that she doesn’t want to presuppose what might happen going forward and what the lack of support from Pierluisi could mean for debt-restructuring efforts. “I’m hopeful that over time people will understand that this is likely to be the most fair and confirmable resolution to exit bankruptcy,” she said. “Hopefully, we’ll reach consensus.” Jaresko noted that more than 70% of pensions would face no cuts, and that most teachers and police officers are under the $1,500 threshold. She added that the board also would set aside a pension reserve trust since it projects budget deficits in upcoming years, and that money in the trust could not be used to help the government make ends meet. Puerto Rico accumulated the debt after decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing to balance budgets. A former governor declared it unpayable in 2015 and then two years later, the government filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history. Officials are now restructuring a portion of that debt amid a nearly 15-year economic crisis that deepened after Hurricane Maria, a string of strong earthquakes that hit a year ago and the ongoing pandemic. The creditor groups involved in the deal hold more than $11 billion worth of bonds. Those who hold more than $8 billion of those bonds said they have engaged in good faith with the board to provide Puerto Rico with the financial flexibility it needs to recover from the pandemic.  “This widely-supported compromise will help Puerto Rico avert years of costly, distracting litigation and finally expedite the island’s long-awaited exit from bankruptcy in 2021,” they said in a statement. The next step is for the court to hold a hearing where details of the plan will be provided. A majority of bondholders would then have to vote in favor of the deal for it to be approved, and then a confirmation hearing would be held. Currently, 60% of bondholders back the deal. The board said mediation continues with creditors that hold other types of bonds, including Employee Retirement System ones.",https://apnews.com/article/us-news-financial-markets-puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-9d6a56ba5347e9eef4bdd74fed8e278a,AP,Neutral
"Deal reached to cut Puerto Rico bond debt, pensions a sticking point",Reuters Staff,2/23/21,"Puerto Rico would substantially reduce its core government debt load under a new deal announced on Tuesday, but obstacles remain for the U.S. territory’s exit from bankruptcy. The island’s federally created financial oversight board said its agreement with certain bondholders was a major step toward resolving the bankruptcy, which began in 2017 in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of debt and other liabilities, including unfunded pensions. “I’m hopeful that people over time will understand this is likely to be the most fair and confirmable resolution to exit bankruptcy,” Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director, told reporters. The deal will be included in a plan of adjustment the board expects to file in March in federal court, with the hope of court approval in the fall. Under the agreement, owners of $18. 8 billion of general obligation (GO) and Public Building Authority (PBA) debt would receive a $7 billion cash payment and $7. 4 billion in new bonds, as well as a capped share of the amount of sales tax revenue that exceeds 2020 fiscal plan projections. The deal would result in an average 27% haircut for GO bondholders and 21% for PBA bondholders and would reduce Puerto Rico’s total debt service payments by 62%, according to the oversight board. That plan also includes pension cuts, a sticking point for Governor Pedro Pierluisi and the island’s legislature which may have to approve any new debt included in the deal. Pierluisi, who took office in January, said while he supported the agreement’s economic terms, he remained opposed to cuts in pension payments for public sector workers and as a result the government would not be part of the agreement.

Board reaches tentative deal to lower Puerto Rico debt,No Author,2/10/21,"A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement in principal with creditors to reduce a portion of the U.S. territory’s more than $70 billion public debt load. The board said the tentative deal followed a mediation process with creditors holding some $7 billion worth of general obligation and Public Building Authority bonds issued by the U.S. territory. “What we achieved at this point is a realistic proposal that will open a path to recovery from bankruptcy,” said board chairman David Skeel. As a result, the board asked a federal judge overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy-like process for an extension to file an amended plan of adjustment. Gov.

Puerto Rico prepares to reopen schools 1 year after pandemic,DÁNICA COTO,2/8/21,"Puerto Rico officials announced Monday that five grades will return to in-person classes next month as the U.S. territory prepares to reopen public schools for the first time in a year, causing some parents to worry about a potential increase in coronavirus cases. Kindergarteners, special education students, and children in first, second, third and 12th grades are tentatively scheduled to be back in classrooms at certain schools March 3, said Elba Aponte, Puerto Rico’s education secretary-designate. “I recognize there is uncertainty among parents and the school community given the announcement of the upcoming reopening,” she said. To minimize the risk of contagion, Aponte said that in-person classes will be held only two times a week and that students will be dismissed before noon, with parents barred from entering schools. Only eight to 12 students will be allowed in a classroom and school cafeterias will remain closed, although they will offer a “grab-and-go” option. Masks, hand sanitizers and thermometers will be available at all schools, Aponte said, adding that more than 24,000 employees have already received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine. “The vast majority concur that it is time for our students, children and youth to be able to have contact with their teachers and classmates,” Aponte said. She made the announcement via Facebook, prompting a swarm of criticism. “Sending children to school without vaccines, in a rush and without a plan that exceeds expectations IS A CRIME,” wrote one woman. Another worried about the level of cleanliness and whether teachers or employees will ensure that children have their masks on at all times.  Others wrote that they would keep their children at home. “With great respect, it is crazy to start classes(.) They should wait until August or until conditions permit,” one said. The island’s Department of Education has not yet identified which schools will reopen. Officials expect to release a list by mid-February. The Teachers’ Association of Puerto Rico also criticized the reopening, questioning whether the government is sufficiently prepared to avoid an increase in coronavirus cases. Víctor Bonilla, the association’s president, said the organization is requesting that the government provide specific statistics about all department employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus. “If the government cannot provide that precise data, it’s not in a position to talk about reopening schools in March,” Bonilla said. “We know that under normal circumstances schools are never ready.” The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 161,300 confirmed and suspected cases of coronavirus infections and more than 1,880 deaths related to COVID-19.  Authorities have vaccinated more than 266,000 people and are awaiting a slight increase in the more than 41,000 doses received weekly.

Puerto Rico’s governor unveils budget priorities amid crisis,DÁNICA COTO,2/3/21,"Puerto Rico’s new governor said Wednesday that modernizing government services, repairing roads and increasing the salaries of certain public workers are among the priorities in the U.S. territory’s proposed $10.7 billion budget. One of the largest investments — $127 million — is slated for the island’s Department of Transportation and Public Works for the maintenance and paving of roads that have severely deteriorated in many parts of an island still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria and a string of strong earthquakes amid an economic crisis that has lasted more than a decade. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi also is allocating $50 million to increase the salaries of an unspecified number of government employees that he says are earning below the average range, in addition to $15 million for the island’s Department of Corrections for the same purpose. Another $50 million is slated to provide Puerto Rico’s police department, one of the largest in a U.S. jurisdiction, with updated equipment and technology. In addition, Pierluisi said he plans to launch a $5.5 million pilot program to fight childhood poverty on the U.S. territory of 3.2 million people where more than 40% live below the federal poverty line. The program would see some $100 to $125 awarded per child. Another $15 million would be destined to a pilot program to help recent graduates find jobs and stop an exodus to the U.S. mainland from an island with a 9% unemployment rate that has worsened amid the pandemic. “It’s an ambitious project, but it reflects the needs of our people,” Pierluisi said in a press conference via Zoom since he’s in isolation after having had contact with the mayor of San Juan, who recently tested positive for COVID-19. If Pierluisi’s proposals are approved by a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances, Puerto Ricans also could see an improvement in government services, with $5 million set aside for technology and innovation. The proposal comes amid longtime complaints about the bureaucratic process to obtain permits and licenses that critics say has delayed economic development. Puerto Rico also is trying to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt load after declaring it unpayable in 2015 and filing for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history two years later. Juan Blanco, director of the Office of Budget and Management, said the proposed budget is some $700 million bigger than what the board requires, although Pierluisi said he believes the board will recognize the island’s needs. If the board insists on cutting the proposed budget, Pierluisi said his top two priorities are to maintain the current budgets of the island’s 78 municipalities and that of the University of Puerto Rico, the territory’s largest public university. Blanco said a final budget would be ready by late May.",https://apnews.com/article/technology-coronavirus-pandemic-latin-america-financial-markets-puerto-rico-f781a7adaf0d7149074891d005d4e6e1,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico to get billions for storm aid, reconstruction",No Author,2/2/21,"Puerto Rico is slated to receive more than $6 billion in federal funds to help prepare the U.S. territory for future hurricanes and other disasters, officials said Tuesday. The money assigned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development would be used for infrastructure projects and economic development, among other things, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said.  In addition, Puerto Rico now has access to $3.2 billion to continue rebuilding from hurricanes Irma and Maria, said Pierluisi, who praised the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden for acting quickly. Congress had assigned $67 billion to help with reconstruction efforts after the hurricanes devastated the island in September 2017, but of the $43 billion obligated, Puerto Rico has only received $18 billion amid concerns over how the money would be spent.",https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-us-news-puerto-rico-hurricane-irma-storms-4a4ccd052155586f9f835b4571ffc3aa,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico to reopen beaches, relax coronavirus curfew",DÁNICA COTO,1/5/21,"Puerto Rico’s new governor announced Tuesday that he will reopen beaches, marinas and pools, eliminate a Sunday lockdown and shorten a curfew that has been in place since the pandemic began to control the number of COVID-19 cases. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi stressed alcohol will be banned at beaches and other places, and that social distancing is required between people who are not family members, with no large groups allowed to gather. Meanwhile, the new curfew will run from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and face masks remain mandatory. He said the new measures go into effect Jan. 8 and will be in place for 30 days but can be amended any time if there’s a spike in cases. The announcement was cheered by many across Puerto Rico who have long sought to visit the U.S. territory’s beaches that had remained off limits to all except those doing exercise. “It’s quality of life,” Pierluisi said. He also ordered Puerto Rico’s Treasury Department to use federal funds and create economic incentives to help tens of thousands of small and medium businesses hard hit by strict closures that have been in place since March.  The U.S. territory of 3.2 million people has reported more than 127,000 confirmed and probable cases and more than 1,200 confirmed deaths. Pierluisi kept in place other measures implemented by former Gov. Wanda Vázquez, including the closure of bars and a limited capacity at gyms, restaurants and other places. “Our goal has to be to be able to return to a new normal,” Pierluisi said. “We have to keep taking preventive measures in the meantime.” The announcement comes the same day that health experts began receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine dose, with some 60,000 people vaccinated so far and an expected 90,000 by the end of the week. Those scheduled to be vaccinated soon include teachers, with Pierluisi saying in-person classes could resume by March on a gradual scale.  Carlos Mellado, Puerto Rico’s designated health secretary, said he expects 40,000 vaccine doses to arrive on the island every week. Meanwhile, officials reported an outbreak at a prison in the northern city of Bayamon, with more than 140 inmates testing positive. Nearly all are asymptomatic, but two have been hospitalized. Officials said the outbreak began when a corrections officer who had COVID-19 came into contact with five inmates.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-pedro-pierluisi-0b3582e39752e5c7a61173990f37f34a,AP,Neutral
Trump administration announces $3.7 billion for Puerto Rico,No Author,1/5/21,"The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will award a $3.7 billion grant to help Puerto Rico rebuild water and wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations and reservoirs damaged by Hurricane Maria more than three years ago. The administration has been slow to release $44 billion in money that was approved for Puerto Rico following the devastating hurricane. But the White House said that once the water funding is allocated, the Trump administration will have obligated more than $40 billion to the island’s recovery. Trump has spent much of his administration blasting Puerto Rican officials as corrupt and inept, and he had opposed spending federal dollars to rebuild a power grid and other infrastructure that was wiped out by Maria in September 2017.  But in September, he set aside his past bitter treatment of the island and its leaders, with his administration approving a $13 billion infusion that mostly went to rebuild an electrical grid that was wiped out by the storm and resulted in the longest blackout in U.S. history. That announcement came as Trump courted voters from Puerto Rico, most notably in the swing state of Florida. The grant announced Tuesday covers 90% of the estimated costs of the water and wastewater improvement projects.  Even now, three years after the storm, thousands of homes are still damaged in Puerto Rico. The island has also been hit by a series of damaging earthquakes and remains mired in a deep economic crisis, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-water-treatment-hurricanes-hurricane-maria-wastewater-60d9f3f15c36b064df58533160230f44,AP,Neutral
New governor sworn in as a wary Puerto Rico demands changes,DÁNICA COTO,1/2/21,"Pedro Pierluisi vowed to achieve statehood for Puerto Rico and fight against poverty, corruption and COVID-19 after he was sworn in Saturday as the U.S. territory’s new governor. Pierluisi, a Democrat who previously served as Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress for eight years, also promised to prioritize education, lift the government out of bankruptcy and alleviate a deep economic crisis as leader of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. “I have listened to our people and acknowledged the needs for better governance,” he said in a bilingual speech with a strong conciliatory tone. “I need everyone to battle our common enemies.” Saturday’s ceremony marked the end of a chaotic four-year period in which Puerto Rico had three governors, including Pierluisi himself briefly after former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló stepped down last year following huge street protests.  Pierluisi, 61, inherits a stagnant economy, a divided legislature, a billion-dollar public debt restructuring and a politically fractured U.S. territory hit hard by the pandemic as it still struggles to recover from hurricanes and earthquakes. “Some very difficult years await him and the island,” said political analyst Mario Negrón. “The economy is in critical condition, and even though federal funds are on their way, people forget that the debt will have to be paid starting in February.” Pierluisi, who is known for his conciliatory nature, will be leading a disgruntled and exhausted population after obtaining the lowest number of votes of any governor in Puerto Rico’s history. He received nearly 33% of votes compared with nearly 32% obtained by Carlos Delgado of the Popular Democratic Party, marking the first time either party failed to reach 40% of votes. New and longtime minority political parties gained ground during November’s election, with no clear majority emerging in the island’s legislature, meaning Pierluisi will have to seek consensus with members of four other parties, Negrón said. “I’d like to think that people will grow during this moment of political crisis,” he said. “Experience has taught me all the contrary.” During November’s election, voters also participated in a non-binding referendum that asked, “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the union as a state?” More than 52% of voters approved, but any changes to the island’s political status need approval from U.S. Congress. It is the island’s sixth such referendum.  President-elect Joe Biden has promised to work with local government officials who support a variety of political outcomes for Puerto Rico to “initiate a just and binding process” for the island to determine its own status. Despite Pierluisi’s search for statehood, political analyst Eduardo Villanueva said the new governor and his party face a fundamental problem: they haven’t said what kind of contributions, including economic ones, Puerto Rico would make if it becomes a state.  Villanueva also noted that Pierluisi’s agenda could be limited by the powers of a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances: “One doesn’t have the last word and cannot establish priorities.” Congress created the board in 2016, a year after Puerto Rico declared its more than $70 billion public debt unpayable, an amount accumulated in part by previous administrations borrowing money to cover budget deficits. Pierluisi takes over from Gov. Wanda Vázquez, whom the island’s Supreme Court ordered be appointed governor in August 2019 after Rosselló resigned. At the time she was the island’s justice secretary, but since there was no secretary of state at the time, Puerto Rico’s constitution dictated she assume the governorship. Vázquez later lost against Pierluisi during a chaotic primary in early August that had to be held a second time because ballots did not make it to voting centers on time. Saturday’s outdoors event was fiercely criticized by many Puerto Ricans angry that Pierluisi invited some 400 guests despite the pandemic and amid measures that prohibit people from gathering in large groups or going to the beach unless they’re exercising. Pierluisi defended his actions, noting that face masks were mandatory and that everyone attending had to submit a negative COVID-19 test. Independent health experts, however, warned the event still posed a risk. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 127,000 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases and more than 1,500 deaths. A new legislature also was sworn in on Saturday, marking the first time that the majority of Puerto Rico’s Senate is female.",https://apnews.com/article/us-news-puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-financial-markets-poverty-fccd0137008f0ab0f8794c00c4b6acdf,AP,Neutral
"Feral pigs flummox Puerto Rico, infiltrate communities",DÁNICA COTO,12/24/20,"Thousands of Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs are snorting and squealing their way across Puerto Rico in what many fear has become an unstoppable quest to eat and reproduce on an island struggling to stop them. They forage through gardens and farms, knock over trash cans and leave pungent trails of urine and excrement, stopping occasionally to bathe if they find potholes full of rainwater. The former pets — or descendants of former pets — have reproduced at such an alarming rate that the U.S. territory declared a health emergency last year so federal officials could start eradicating them. It’s the latest non-native species to invade communities in Puerto Rico like iguanas and caimans did before them, although these are proving particularly hard to control and can’t be killed for food because they carry so many diseases. Crews from Georgia, Alabama and Florida helped remove 500 pigs in four days last August, but the swine are so numerous and scattered that officials had to reconvene and come up with a new plan they launched several weeks ago, said Gustavo Olivieri, Caribbean district assistant supervisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. “It was out of control,” he said of the hundreds of pigs concentrated in just one impoverished area in Puerto Rico’s capital. “We realized there were way more animals than we anticipated.” The problem started about five years ago after people began buying the pigs as pets without knowing they would grow to weigh 250 pounds or more. Olivieri said the pigs multiplied after Hurricane Maria struck in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm because some escaped their confinement while others were set free by their families. While there are no official numbers, Olivieri said he estimates there are now thousands of pigs roaming across Puerto Rico, with 67 of the island’s 78 municipalities reporting sightings. He said that while feral hogs are a problem in the U.S. mainland, it is nowhere near the level of what’s happening with the Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs in Puerto Rico. There are no species of pigs native to the island, whose signature dish is arguably lechón asado, or roast pig, thanks to the Spaniards introducing the species in the early 1500s. On a recent afternoon, pigs of all sizes rummaged through piles of garbage and mingled with roosters and dogs in Cantera, a neighborhood in the capital of San Juan that has long been neglected by the government. Broken glass clinked beneath the tiny hooves of baby pigs as they scurried about while sows stood their ground as nearby drivers slowed down, some smiling. Community leaders said they understood the attraction that some people feel toward the pigs: “When they’re small, they look real cute,” said 31-year-old Valerie Figueroa, adding that some Puerto Ricans who live near the pigs use social media to give the littles ones away as pets. So it’s a struggle to make people understand how much trouble they cause, she said as she opened a brochure that she created and printed herself titled, “Problems with garbage? Problems with pigs? If you answered Yes, this document is for you.” Inside the brochure are pictures of a makeshift corral that fed-up neighbors have built to fence in the pigs and prevent them from entering their community. To residents who insist on feeding the pigs despite being told they’re extremely smart and will return to the same place for food, Figueroa encourages them to drop the leftovers off at the corral. The problem goes beyond the smell and knocked-over garbage cans. Figueroa said her aunt tripped when one pig chased her and then bit her on the knee, which required surgery. Another neighbor, 52-year-old Jesús Laracuente, said they’ve invaded his garden, where he once grew pigeon peas, taro roots, tomatoes, pumpkins and coriander. “All I have left is three little plantain trees,” he said. A couple of blocks away, 36-year-old government worker Luis Meléndez fixed a flat tire in front of his home as a sounder of swine rooting across an abandoned park, flicking their short little tails. He shook his head. “They squeal all the time,” he said, adding that they don’t let him sleep. “They’re a disaster.” The pigs start reproducing before they’re a year old, and they can give birth to up to 10 piglets at a time, Olivieri said. That’s a challenge, especially given their high survival rate, lack of natural predators on the island and willingness to eat nearly anything, he said, adding that they can’t be killed for food because they carry about 30 different diseases, including various types of herpes. Given the animals’ intelligence, scientists tried a new approach after last year’s captures. They studied the pigs’ habits and behaviors and what kind of traps worked best. They did stakeouts in the field, noting that some groups of pigs were attracted only to corn while others were enticed by fruit. The project to eradicate them could take a couple of years. Once the pigs are trapped, Olivieri said, they are taken to a facility owned by Puerto Rico’s Department of Agriculture and euthanized in a humane way.  That process has drawn sharp criticism from animal rights groups such as Women United for Animal Welfare, who decry the killing of pigs and demand they be relocated to a safe area until someone can find a home for them or a sanctuary can be built. More than 65,000 people have signed a petition backing such proposals.  Meanwhile, the president of Cantera’s neighborhood council says residents can only wait. “We realized this situation had gotten out of control,” said Gertrudis Calderón. “It’s become a health problem.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-san-juan-9412885385206e9fbb4b33df3719a17f,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico seeks to arrest US tourist who refused face mask,No Author,12/4/20,"A judge on Friday ordered the arrest of a tourist from the U.S. mainland who is accused of attacking a National Guard trooper at Puerto Rico’s airport after refusing to wear a face mask as required under pandemic restrictions. The suspect was identified as 31-year-old Adrien Williams. He faces charges including assault in the Nov. 28 incident caught on video that went viral. Brenda Quijano, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice, told The Associated Press that Williams lives in Lake Elsinore, California, but was born in South Carolina. His current whereabouts were not known. The incident angered many Puerto Ricans who have repeatedly complained about tourists refusing to wear face masks as the U.S. territory faces a record number of coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths, burdening an already fragile health system. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 51,600 confirmed cases and more than 1,100 deaths. On Thursday, Gov. Wanda Vázquez announced stricter measures to fight a rise in COVID-19 cases, including the closure of marinas, a lockdown on Sundays and a ban on weekend alcohol sales.",https://apnews.com/article/health-arrests-puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-ee727787968418596ea14be36a2332e8,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico to lock down Sundays, close marinas for holidays",DÁNICA COTO,12/3/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Thursday announced stricter measures to fight COVID-19, including a lockdown on Sundays and the closure of all marinas as the U.S. territory grapples with an increase in cases and deaths. Gov. Wanda Vázquez also tightened a curfew, with businesses now ordered to close by 8:30 p.m. and no one allowed on streets from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for essential workers and those delivering food until 11 p.m. Only gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores and hardware stores will be allowed to open on Sundays, though restaurants can offer delivery or carry-out. In addition, alcohol sales will be banned from 5 am. on Saturdays to 5 a.m. on Mondays. The new measures begin Monday and run through Jan. 7, the height of the island’s Christmas holiday and tourism season. Beaches will remain closed except to those doing exercise. “We have to pause to save the lives of our old people mainly,” Vázquez said after she read the names and ages of the latest COVID-19 deaths reported Thursday. Some of the measures were criticized by various business groups, which warned that up to 25% of businesses might not survive the pandemic by next year, adding that the weekend ban on alcohol sales will hit especially hard.  The newest restrictions come as Puerto Rico still struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria and a string of strong earthquakes that hit nearly a year ago. The U.S. territory is trying to emerge from a years-long recession and to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt. The governor warned that if the number of coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths kept increasing, she would implement a total lockdown. But, for now, she did not approve other restrictions recommended by independent health experts, including closing commercial businesses and allowing them only to sell online. The island of 3.2 million people has had more than 52,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 1,150 deaths from COVID-19. More than 100 people are now connected to artificial respirators, the highest number since the pandemic began. November also was the month with the highest number of deaths, with the intensive care unit of at least one major hospital at capacity. “This is not acceptable for any government that values life,” the governor said. Health Secretary Lorenzo González said more than 500 new cases are being reported daily, adding that the new measures are needed because health care workers are exhausted and the island’s health system heavily burdened. “We need to give them a breather,” he said. Officials have said they expect the first of some 1 million vaccine doses to arrive in mid-December, with health care workers and certain public employees taking priority.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-3a870e3884c7e50922e2459acb5a37be,AP,Neutral
"Huge Puerto Rico radio telescope, already damaged, collapses",DÁNICA COTO,12/1/20,"A huge, already damaged radio telescope in Puerto Rico that has played a key role in astronomical discoveries for more than half a century completely collapsed on Tuesday. The telescope’s 900-ton receiver platform and the Gregorian dome — a structure as tall as a four-story building that houses secondary reflectors — fell onto the northern portion of the vast reflector dish more than 400 feet below. The U.S. National Science Foundation had earlier announced that it would close the radio telescope. An auxiliary cable snapped in August, causing a 100-foot gash on the 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish and damaged the receiver platform that hung above it. Then a main cable broke in early November. The collapse stunned many scientists who had relied on what was until recently the largest radio telescope in the world. “It sounded like a rumble. I knew exactly what it was,” said Jonathan Friedman, who worked for 26 years as a senior research associate at the observatory and still lives near it. “I was screaming. Personally, I was out of control.... I don’t have words to express it. It’s a very deep, terrible feeling.” Friedman ran up a small hill near his home and confirmed his suspicions: A cloud of dust hung in the air where the structure once stood, demolishing hopes held by some scientists that the telescope could somehow be repaired. The collapse at 7:56 a.m. on Tuesday wasn’t a surprise because many of the wires in the thick cables holding the structure snapped over the weekend, Ángel Vázquez, the telescope’s director of operations, told The Associated Press. “It was a snowball effect,” he said. “There was no way to stop it.... It was too much for the old girl to take.” He said that it was extremely difficult to say whether anything could have been done to prevent the damage that occurred after the first cable snapped in August.  “The maintenance was kept up as best as we could,” he said. “(The National Science Foundation) did the best that they could with what they have.” However, observatory director Francisco Córdova, said that while the NSF decided it was too risky to repair the damaged cables before Tuesday’s collapse, he believes there had been options, such as relieving tension in certain cables or using helicopters to help redistribute weight. Meanwhile, installing a new telescope would cost up to $350 million, money the NSF doesn’t have, Vázquez said, adding it would have to come from U.S. Congress.  “It’s a huge loss,” said Carmen Pantoja, an astronomer and professor at the University of Puerto Rico who used the telescope for her doctorate. “It was a chapter of my life.” Scientists worldwide had been petitioning U.S. officials and others to reverse the NSF’s decision to close the observatory. The NSF said at the time that it intended to eventually reopen the visitor center and restore operations at the observatory’s remaining assets, including its two LIDAR facilities used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research, including analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data. The LIDAR facilities are still operational, along with a 12-meter telescope and a photometer used to study photons in the atmosphere, Vázquez said. “We are saddened by this situation but thankful that no one was hurt,” NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement. “When engineers advised NSF that the structure was unstable and presented a danger to work teams and Arecibo staff, we took their warnings seriously.” The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. It had endured hurricanes, tropical humidity and a recent string of earthquakes in its 57 years of operation. The telescope has been used to track asteroids on a path to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable. It also served as a training ground for graduate students and drew about 90,000 visitors a year. “I am one of those students who visited it when young and got inspired,” said Abel Méndez, a physics and astrobiology professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo who has used the telescope for research. “The world without the observatory loses, but Puerto Rico loses even more.”  He last used the telescope on Aug. 6, just days before a socket holding the auxiliary cable that snapped failed in what experts believe could be a manufacturing error. The National Science Foundation, which owns the observatory that is managed by the University of Central Florida, said crews who evaluated the structure after the first incident determined that the remaining cables could handle the additional weight. But on Nov. 6, another cable broke. Scientists had used the telescope to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed. About 250 scientists worldwide had been using the observatory when it closed in August, including Méndez, who was studying stars to detect habitable planets. “I’m trying to recover,” he said. “I am still very much affected.”",https://apnews.com/article/technology-arecibo-observatory-puerto-rico-science--0da6abb251f455977bf0c752348e712e,AP,Neutral
Huge Puerto Rico radio telescope to close in blow to science,DÁNICA COTO,11/19/20,"The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that it will close the huge telescope at the renowned Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in a blow to scientists worldwide who depend on it to search for planets, asteroids and extraterrestrial life. The independent, federally funded agency said it’s too dangerous to keep operating the single dish radio telescope -- one of the world’s largest -- given the significant damage it recently sustained. An auxiliary cable broke in August and tore a 100-foot hole in the reflector dish and damaged the dome above it. Then on Nov. 6, one of the telescope’s main steel cables snapped, leading officials to warn that the entire structure could collapse. NSF officials noted that even if crews were to repair all the damage, engineers found that the structure would still be unstable in the long term. “This decision is not an easy one for NSF to make, but the safety of people is our number one priority,” said Sean Jones, the agency’s assistant director for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. “We understand how much Arecibo means to this community and to Puerto Rico.” He said the goal was to preserve the telescope without placing people at risk, but, “we have found no path forward to allow us to do so safely.” The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. In its 57 years of operation, it endured hurricanes, endless humidity and a recent string of strong earthquakes. The telescope boasts a 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish featured in the Jodie Foster film “Contact” and the James Bond movie “GoldenEye.” Scientists worldwide have used the dish along with the 900-ton platform hanging 450 feet above it to track asteroids on a path to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable. In recent years, the NSF-owned facility has been managed by the University of Central Florida.  Alex Wolszczan, a Polish-born astronomer and professor at Pennsylvania State University who helped discover the first extrasolar and pulsar planets, told The Associated Press that while the news wasn’t surprising, it was disappointing. He worked at the telescope in the 1980s and early 1990s.  “I was hoping against hope that they would come up with some kind of solution to keep it open,” he said. “For a person who has had a lot of his scientific life associated with that telescope, this is a rather interesting and sadly emotional moment.” The announcement saddened many beyond the scientific world as well, with the hashtag #WhatAreciboMeansToMe popping up on Twitter along with pictures of people working, visiting and even getting married or celebrating a birthday at the telescope. Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s Division of Astronomical Sciences, stressed that the decision has nothing to do with the observatory’s capabilities, which have allowed scientists to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed. “The telescope is currently at serious risk of unexpected, uncontrolled collapse,” he said. “Even attempts at stabilization or testing the cables could result in accelerating the catastrophic failure.” Officials suspect a potential manufacturing error is to blame for the auxiliary cable that snapped after a socket holding it failed, but say they are surprised that a main cable broke about three months later given that it was supporting only about 60% of its capacity. Engineers had assessed the situation after the first cable broke, noting that about 12 of the roughly 160 wires of the second cable that eventually broke had already snapped, said Ashley Zauderer, program officer for Arecibo Observatory at NSF. “It was identified as an issue that needed to be addressed, but it wasn’t seen as an immediate threat,” she said. She and other NSF officials said that all standard maintenance procedures had been followed. The closure is a blow for many of the more than 250 scientists that have used a telescope that is also considered one of Puerto Rico’s main tourist attractions, drawing some 90,000 visitors a year. It also has long served as a training ground for hundreds of graduate students. “It was my Disney,” wrote Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Texas, in a series of tweets. He recalled first visiting when he was 4 or 5. “Think about what the Golden Gate Bridge means to San Francisco, Statue of Liberty to New Yorkers. Arecibo is this and more to Puerto Rico because it has gone beyond an icon.” The NSF said it intends to restore operations at the observatory’s remaining assets including its two LIDAR facilities, one of which is located in the nearby island of Culebra. Those are used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research, including analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data. Officials also aim to resume operations at the visitor center. Wolszczan, the astronomer, said the value of the telescope won’t instantly disappear because he and many other scientists are still working on projects based on observations and data taken from the observatory. “The process of saying goodbye to Arecibo will certainly take some years,” he said. “It won’t be instantaneous.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-radio-telescrope-to-close-b63df9ec84a876ab1c2e665f20e402e4,AP,Neutral
Cable failures endanger renowned Puerto Rico radio telescope,DÁNICA COTO,11/15/20,"The giant, aging cables that support one of the world’s largest single-dish radio telescopes are slowly unraveling in this U.S. territory, pushing an observatory renowned for its key role in astronomical discoveries to the brink of collapse. The Arecibo Observatory, which is tethered above a sinkhole in Puerto Rico’s lush mountain region, boasts a 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish featured in the Jodie Foster film “Contact” and the James Bond movie “GoldenEye.” The dish and a dome suspended above it have been used to track asteroids headed toward Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and helped scientists trying to determine if a planet is habitable. “As someone who depends on Arecibo for my science, I’m frightened. It’s a very worrisome situation right now. There’s a possibility of cascading, catastrophic failure,” said astronomer Scott Ransom with the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, a collaboration of scientists in the U.S. and Canada. Last week, one of the telescope’s main steel cables that was capable of sustaining 1.2 million pounds (544,000 kilograms) snapped under only 624,000 pounds (283,000 kilograms). That failure further mangled the reflector dish after an auxiliary cable broke in August, tearing a 100-foot hole and damaging the dome above it. Officials said they were surprised because they had evaluated the structure in August and believed it could handle the shift in weight based on previous inspections. It’s a blow for the telescope that more than 250 scientists around the world were using. The facility is also one of Puerto Rico’s main tourist attractions, drawing some 90,000 visitors a year. Research has been suspended since August, including a project aiding scientists in their search for nearby galaxies. The telescope was built in the 1960s and financed by the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. It’s endured over a half-century of disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes. Repairs from Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, were still underway when the first cable snapped.  Some new cables are scheduled to arrive next month, but officials said funding for repairs has not been worked out with federal agencies. Scientists warn that time is running out. Only a handful of cables now support the 900-ton platform. “Each of the structure’s remaining cables is now supporting more weight than before, increasing the likelihood of another cable failure, which would likely result in the collapse of the entire structure,” the University of Central Florida, which manages the facility, said in a statement Friday. University officials say crews have already noticed wire breaks on two of the remaining main cables. They warn that employees and contractors are at risk despite relying heavily on drones and remote cameras to assess the damage. The observatory estimates the damage at more than $12 million and is seeking money from the National Science Foundation, an independent federal agency that owns the observatory.  Foundation spokesman Rob Margetta said engineering and cost estimates have not been completed and that funding the repairs would likely involve Congress and discussions with stakeholders. He said the agency is reviewing “all recommendations for action at Arecibo.” “NSF is ultimately responsible for decisions regarding the structure’s safety,” he said in an email. “Our top priority is the safety of anyone at the site.” Representatives of the university and the observatory said the telescope’s director, Francisco Córdova, was not available for comment. In a Facebook post, the observatory said maintenance was up to date and the most recent external structural evaluation occurred after Hurricane Maria. The most recent damage was likely the result of the cable degrading over time and carrying extra weight after the auxiliary cable snapped, the university said. In August, the socket holding that cable failed, possibly the result of manufacturing error, the observatory said. The problems have interrupted the work of researchers like Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Texas. He had planned to study Mars in September during its close approach to Earth. “This is the closest Mars was going to be while also being observable from Arecibo until 2067,” he said. “I won’t be around the next time we can get this level of radar data.” The observatory in Puerto Rico is considered crucial for the study of pulsars, which are the remains of stars that can be used to detect gravitational waves, a phenomenon Albert Einstein predicted in his theory of general relativity. The telescope also is used to search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed. “It’s more than 50 years old, but it remains a very important instrument,” said Alex Wolszczan, a Polish-born astronomer and professor at Pennsylvania State University. He helped discover the first extrasolar and pulsar planets and credited the observatory for having a culture that allowed him to test what he described as wild ideas that sometimes worked.  “Losing it would be a really huge blow to what I think is a very important science,” Wolszczan said. An astronomer at the observatory in the 1980s and early 1990s, Wolszczan still uses the telescope for certain work because it offers an unmatched combination of high frequency range and sensitivity that he said allows for a “huge array” of science projects. Among them: observing molecules of life, detecting radio emission of stars and conducting pulsar work. The telescope also was a training ground for graduate students and widely loved for its educational opportunities, said Carmen Pantoja, an astronomer and professor at the University of Puerto Rico, the island’s largest public university. She relied on it for her doctoral thesis and recalled staring at it in wonder when she was a young girl. “I was struck by how big and mysterious it was,” she said. “The future of the telescope depends greatly on what position the National Science Foundation takes ... I hope they can find a way and that there’s goodwill to save it.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-planets-jodie-foster-053fbf8834e50d5e3ad88443a3fde550,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to activate National Guard to fight COVID-19,DÁNICA COTO,11/13/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Friday that she will activate the National Guard to help enforce a curfew aimed at curbing a rise in COVID-19 cases and other measures, including once again closing beaches to everyone except those doing exercise. Gov. Wanda Vázquez also said the government will limit capacity at restaurants, casinos, gyms, churches and other places to 30%.  The new restrictions start Nov. 16 and will remain in place until Dec. 11. Face masks and a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remain mandatory. “We will not under any circumstance allow our health system to be placed at risk,” she said. “There are many who have lowered their guard and have not understood that this pandemic is still with us.” Vázquez also urged people across Puerto Rico to be extremely cautious during the holiday season, encouraging families to get together via Zoom. She said that if violations continue into mid-December, she would close down more businesses and implement more restrictive measures. Health Department Secretary Lorenzo González said the island is seeing more than 600 infections a day, a number he said could rise to 1,200 or more by late December. He also noted that the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 has spiked in the last month.  “We have outbreaks and infections in every corner,” he said. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 40,500 confirmed cases, more than 35,400 suspected ones and more than 900 deaths. The new measures come as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from hurricanes, earthquakes and an economic and financial crisis that began more than a decade ago. “These are difficult times,” said Manuel Laboy, secretary of the island’s Department of Economic Development and Commerce. “This is causing an economic crisis without precedent.” He said local officials are talking with the U.S. government and a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances to find additional ways to help owners of small- and medium-sized businesses hit by the pandemic.",https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-health-puerto-rico-coronavirus-pandemic-7175cd64689839c3c5e57fa2eee2bb17,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico unearths uncounted ballots 1 week after election,DÁNICA COTO,11/11/20,"Puerto Rico’s elections commission said Tuesday that it has discovered more than 100 briefcases containing uncounted ballots a week after the U.S. territory held its general election, drawing criticism and scorn from voters who now question the validity of the outcomes of certain races. Francisco Rosado, the commission’s new president, said the briefcases were found in a secured vault and blamed the situation on what he said was an underfunded and understaffed administrative board responsible for counting a record number of absentee and early votes. “We’ve identified, much to our regret, a disorganization in the handling of material in the vaults,” he said at a press conference. “Misplaced. Poorly organized. We have to admit that.” Rosado said he didn’t know yet how many total votes are in the 126 briefcases, noting some contained three ballots and others 500 ballots. Officials initially said there were 182 briefcases but later revised the number. “Every vote will be counted,” he said. “I have to tell the people of Puerto Rico to trust the transparency of the process.” The discovery is the latest misstep for a commission that botched the island’s primaries in August so badly that a second round of voting was held, an unprecedented situation that led to the commission’s previous president to resign a month later. Then the commission was criticized for taking a record four days after the Nov. 3 general election to finalize counting nearly all votes, only to announce on Tuesday that it had discovered more briefcases. Traditionally, the commission releases final vote counts the night of the election. Roberto Iván Aponte, electoral commissioner for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party, said in a phone interview that he expects all votes inside the newly discovered suitcases to be counted by Thursday at the latest. He said those votes could affect races like the one for mayor of Culebra, a popular tourist island just east of Puerto Rico. The mayor elect won only by two votes, according to preliminary results. Aponte and other officials blame the ongoing problems on a new law that Gov. Wanda Vázquez approved in June just two months before the primary that led to several changes including the softening of restrictions for absentee and early voting and eliminating departments and high-ranking positions within the elections commission, which led to the departure of longtime officials. This year, Puerto Rico received more than 220,000 absentee and early votes, a record for officials who have been overwhelmed by the paperwork. Aponte warned that the commission’s ongoing problems is sowing doubt among voters. “After these elections, there has to be a serious evaluation of how those votes will be handled,” he said, referring to absentee and early votes.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-uncounted-ballots-one-week-07bd09656b1af00ef6d9864ff35dc32d,AP,Neutral
Pedro Pierluisi wins gubernatorial race in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,11/8/20,"Pedro Pierluisi of Puerto Rico’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party won a majority of votes to become the U.S. territory’s next governor, according to official preliminary results released late Saturday. Pierluisi received nearly 33% of votes compared with nearly 32% obtained by Carlos Delgado of the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the current territorial status, with 100% of precincts reporting. The results come four days after Puerto Rico held general elections, an unusual delay blamed on a record number of early and absentee votes that overwhelmed officials. It’s also the first time that Puerto Rico’s two main parties fail to reach 40% of votes. “These are times to unite wills and purposes,” Pierluisi said in a statement. Pierluisi had claimed victory the night of the election as Delgado refused to concede, noting that his opponent was leading by a very slim margin and that thousands of votes still had not been counted.  On Saturday, he congratulated Pierluisi: “The island needs consensus, dialogue and convergence so that we can face the great challenges of the future.” Saturday’s results were released hours after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden won the election in the U.S. mainland, a victory that Pierluisi said would help Puerto Rico finally gain statehood. He congratulated Biden and said he looked forward to working with him and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris “for the benefit of all Puerto Ricans in their fight for progress and equality.” Voters in Puerto Rico participated in a non-binding referendum the day of the local general election that asked, “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the union as a state?” More than 52% of voters approved, but any changes to the island’s political status needs approval from U.S. Congress. It is the island’s sixth such referendum. Biden has promised to work with local government officials who support a variety of political status for Puerto Rico to “initiate a just and binding process” for the island to determine its own status.  Biden also promised to fight against austerity measures sought by a federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances amid an economic crisis; accelerate the disbursement of federal funds for hurricane and earthquake reconstruction; and push for equal funding of Medicaid, Medicare and Supplemental Security Income, since Puerto Rico receives less than U.S. states. Other results released late Saturday included those of a tight race for the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital. New Progressive Miguel Romero received more than 36% of votes, compared with more than 34% obtained by third-party candidate Manuel Natal of the Citizen Victory Movement. Natal rejected the results and said not all votes have been counted.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-general-elections-elections-latin-america-pedro-pierluisi-12defbcc08b4e5dbd53940c18ba87ff7,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico awaits final result in tight gubernatorial race,DÁNICA COTO,11/4/20,"People across Puerto Rico awaited final results Wednesday of elections that saw long lines of voters and produced a tight gubernatorial race in the U.S. Caribbean territory. Pedro Pierluisi of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party held a slight lead over Carlos Delgado of the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island’s current status. More than 12,000 votes separated the top two candidates after counting more than 95% of the ballots cast Tuesday as well as some returns from early and absentee ballots, which were also still being tallied. Pierluisi celebrated the early results and held a news conference, while Delgado said shortly after midnight that he would await final results. “It’s irresponsible,” Delgado said of Pierluisi’s actions. Meanwhile, Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico’s current representative in U.S. Congress and Pierluisi’s running partner, easily won a second term. The preliminary results disappointed voters like 69-year-old David Jorge Santos, who said he had been a longtime supporter of one of the two main parties — though he declined to say which — but this year voted for a new party because he said the New Progressives and Popular Democrats don’t deliver. “It’s one promise after another and they don’t do anything,” Santos said. It’s the first time that neither of Puerto Rico’s two main parties won more than 40% of the overall vote and neither will hold a majority in the legislature, according to preliminary results. New parties and candidates won several legislative seats. The island’s Senate also for the first time will have a gay Black woman as a member. “There were fundamental changes,” said political analyst Domingo Emanuelli.“They’re seeking candidates not based on ideology, gender or party, but because they’re decent. This is work that takes four, five, 10 years, but the people have already started.” Voters also favored a nonbinding referendum that asked, “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the union as a state?,” which was backed by more than 52% support, with more than 95% of votes counted. However, U.S. Congress would have to approve of any changes to the island’s political status. The race to become mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital also was extremely tight, with only hundreds of votes separating two candidates, including one from a new party. The winner would replace Carmen Yulín Cruz, known for her public spats with U.S. President Donald Trump. As results trickled in late Tuesday, car horns blared and occasional fireworks pierced the night as supporters celebrated. Trailing the two main candidates were Juan Dalmau of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which for the first time since the 1950s obtained double-digit support, Alexandra Lúgaro of Citizen Victory Movement, César Vázquez of the Dignity Project and independent candidate Eliezer Molina. It was the first election held since Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017, causing damages estimated at more than $100 billion and killing an estimated 2,975 people.  Less than two years after the storm, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the streets in protest and prompted Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to quit, an event known as the “Summer of 2019” that was sparked by a leaked chat in which the then-governor and other officials made fun of hurricane victims, among other things, and made comments that led to an investigation into possible corruption. Pierluisi briefly served as governor following last year’s protests and previously represented Puerto Rico in Congress for eight years. He and Rosselló are from the same party. The candidates faced a dwindling voter base because of emigration caused by hardship. There are 2.36 million eligible voters, compared with 2.87 million in 2016 and 2.4 million in 2012. Despite the drop in eligible voters, the diversity of parties and candidates has increased in recent years, eroding the grip of the traditional parties. Rafael Fonseca, an administrator, said he had hoped neither of the two parties would win this year. “They’ve been doing the same thing for years and there’s no change,” he said, adding that the island’s public education system needs to be improved and wages increased to prevent the loss of young people moving to the U.S. mainland in search of work. Fonseca lamented that the energy fueling last year’s protests and demands for new leaders seemed to have dissipated.  “Puerto Ricans have a short memory,” he said, adding that he remains hopeful a non-traditional party will eventually lead Puerto Rico. “Possibly not in my lifetime.” The election came amid an economic crisis and efforts to restructure a portion of Puerto Rico’s more than $70 billion public debt, which officials declared unpayable in 2015. The new governor will have to work alongside a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances and has previously clashed with local officials over austerity measures, including proposed public pension cuts.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-pedro-pierluisi-elections-latin-america-c5aada2ab3b841d180aa99d1547f2cf6,AP,Neutral
Tight gubernatorial contest as Puerto Rico counts votes,DÁNICA COTO,11/4/20,"Puerto Rico’s two main political parties were in a tight gubernatorial race late Tuesday after voters stood in long lines and forced polling centers to remain open late as they chose new leaders they hope can help heal a U.S. territory wracked by corruption, hurricanes, earthquakes and the coronavirus pandemic. Early results gave a slim lead to Pedro Pierluisi of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, the territory’s former non-voting representative in Congress who briefly served as governor following huge street protests last year that led Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to resign. Carlos Delgado of the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island’s territorial status, was a close second.  Less than 10,000 votes separated the top two candidates after counting of nearly 90% of the ballots cast Tuesday as well as some returns from early and absentee ballots, which were also still being counted. Meanwhile, Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico’s current representative in Congress, easily won a second term. Lagging behind in the governor’s race were Juan Dalmau of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which for the first time since the 1950s obtained double-digit support, Alexandra Lúgaro of Citizen Victory Movement, César Vázquez of the Dignity Project and independent candidate Eliezer Molina. The results trickled in just hours after voters armed with water, snacks and folding chairs fanned themselves as they waited under a harsh sun to cast their ballots Some arrived around dawn and waited up to three hours for centers to open. An elderly man slowly walked past one long line, raised his cane and shouted, “Let’s vote for our homeland!” as those around him cheered. Also on the ballot was the island’s sixth referendum on whether to change its current territorial status. It asked one question: “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the union as a state?” The vote is advisory as Congress would have to approve that happening. Statehood was leading with more than 50% of support and more than 80% of votes counted, according to early results. As people still waited to vote, Puerto Rico’s elections commission began posting early results until its website crashed, eliciting a groan from many across the island who drew comparisons to a botched primary in August that forced a second round of voting. Among those last in line as the sun went down was Alma Alicea, a 41-year-old veterinarian.  “It’s been a rough couple of years,” she said, explaining why she doesn’t support either of the two main parties that have long dominated politics on the island. “There are better options this time around.” The election attracted people including Miguel Ángel Velázquez, a 64-year-old handyman who remained indecisive until just days ago and said the candidate he chose has a platform he feels will boost the economy and help lift people out of poverty. “The situation in general here in Puerto Rico is chaotic,” he said. In the race to become the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital, three candidates are vying to replace San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, known for sparring with U.S. President Donald Trump after Hurricane Maria hit the island in September 2017, causing damages estimated at more than $100 billion and killing an estimated 2,975 people in its aftermath.  Less than two years after the storm, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the streets to demand the resignation of Rosselló in an event known as the “Summer of 2019,” a movement sparked by a leaked chat in which the then governor and other officials made fun of hurricane victims, among other things, and made comments that led to an investigation into possible corruption. The new candidates are promising to fight corruption and turn the island around at a time of economic crisis and efforts to restructure a portion of Puerto Rico’s more than $70 billion public debt, which officials declared unpayable in 2015. Whoever wins will have to work alongside a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances and has previously clashed with local officials over austerity measures, including proposed public pension cuts. Candidates also face a dwindling voter base because of emigration caused by hardship. There are 2.36 million eligible voters, compared with 2.87 million in 2016 and 2.4 million in 2012.  Among those who voted was reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny, who is credited with encouraging young people to participate and generated a small buzz as he waited to cast his ballot, taking several selfies with other voters. Some Puerto Ricans have welcomed the increasing diversity of parties and candidates in recent years, which has slowly eroded the grip that the New Progressives and Popular Democrats have had on the island’s politics for decades. “We’re seeing some transformative years,” said Roberto Robles, a 21-year-old voting for the first time. On Sunday, he stood near a stoplight in his hometown of Guayanilla, a community on the island’s southwestern coast that was among the hardest hit by a series of damaging earthquakes that began late last December. He was alone and carried a poster that read, “Why would you choose the same thing? Vote,” as cars around him honked in approval. Political analyst Mario Negrón said he wasn’t surprised by the protests or the demand for new parties and faces as the island’s infrastructure deteriorates, administrations of the two main parties keep losing credibility and an exodus to the U.S. mainland continues. “It’s obvious this was going to be the end product,” he said. “Puerto Rico’s public administration collapsed a long time ago. ... The question is, Now what?”",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-san-juan-latin-america-hurricanes-2e08a3d3ee4ab3654b20903b2e0d3fa8,AP,Neutral
5 parties field candidates for Puerto Rico governor,DÁNICA COTO,11/2/20,"Candidates from five parties are vying Tuesday to become Puerto Rico’s next governor, facing voters in the U.S. territory weary of corruption and seeking relief from an onslaught of hurricanes, earthquakes and the coronavirus that has deepened a decade-long economic crisis. The election is coming as Puerto Rico struggles to restructure a $70 billion public debt that the island government says is unpayable and just over a year since street protests led former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to resign. The protests began after someone leaked a private chat between him and other officials that included homophobic remarks, jokes about Hurricane Maria victims and comments that prompted investigations into possible corruption. The field of six includes four candidates not allied with the two parties that have long dominated politics on the island — the pro-statehood New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports keeping territorial status. They are Juan Dalmau of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, Alexandra Lúgaro of the Citizen Victory Movement, César Vázquez of the Dignity Project and Eliezer Molina, who is running as an independent. Representing the two traditional parties are Charlie Delgado for the Popular Democrats, the longtime mayor of the northwestern coastal city of Isabela, and Pedro Pierluisi for the New Progressives, who beat interim Gov. Wanda Vázquez in the party primary. Pierluisi represented the U.S. territory in Congress for eight years and served briefly as governor during last year’s political turmoil. “It’s a new ballgame,” said Mario Negrón Portillo, retired head of the school of public administration at the University of Puerto Rico. “After what happened last summer, there’s a lot of uncertainty and a lot of doubt about how that will be reflected ... Will what happened truly take root?” Candidates know some people are seething over government corruption, inefficiency and lack of transparency and have pledged measures such as greater scrutiny of contracts. Lúgaro, for example, said she would cap salaries of agency directors and ban the legislature from awarding contracts to family members. Dalmau’s proposals include banning the government from awarding contracts to those previously convicted of corruption. The island traditionally has had high voter participation, but tens of thousands of people left after Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico in September 2017, causing more than $100 billion in damage and killing an estimated 2,975 people in its aftermath. More left following a series of strong earthquakes that began last December, and others have been chased away by the long economic crisis that has more than 40% of the island’s 3.2 million people living in poverty. “Everyone is going to lose voters,” Negrón said of the five parties, one of the highest number of parties to participate in recent years. The elections commission says there are 2.36 million eligible voters, compared with 2.87 million in 2016 and 2.4 million in 2012. There are approximately 121,300 newly registered voters, but that is nearly 57,000 less than four years ago and more than 100,000 less than in 2012. Still, there are indications of enthusiasm for casting a ballot. Long lines formed at the elections commission this year before the deadline for registration, some of them young people encouraged by pictures that reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny posted as he brandished his voter ID. “Puerto Rico needs a change,” the musician, whose real name is Benito Martínez Ocasio, said when he registered to vote in August. “Enough of the abuse of the same two parties that have sequestered Puerto Rico for decades ... it’s time to make history.” A Gaither poll conducted in September and October for the newspaper El Vocero said 23% of those surveyed remained undecided. Meanwhile, 56% declined to identify with any party, 20% backed the New Progressives and 15% the Popular Democrats. In addition to electing a governor, Puerto Ricans will be voting in a nonbinding referendum on statehood, an addition that many islanders consider a ploy by the administration of the pro-statehood New Progressives to draw out supporters. It is the island’s sixth such plebiscite, but the first to ask a single, simple question: “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the union as a state?” Regardless of the outcome, Congress would have to approve of it. Twenty-year-old Isis Rodríguez Caraballo is one of those who will be voting for the first time. “The people who are governing right now are not working for the people, but for themselves,” she said. Rodríguez was worried the pandemic had dampened the energy that fueled last year’s protests, but then she got together with relatives a week ago. She described most of her family as traditional yet found they were talking about change. “They believe there are certain candidates who can give us a better future,” she said. “Many people are tired of the same old thing.”",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-elections-financial-markets-hurricanes-74c6d09b425859b5a1f3e4d1a3603536,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico debt restructuring hits snag in public clash,DÁNICA COTO,10/30/20,"A plan to pull Puerto Rico out of a type of bankruptcy by 2021 hit a major obstacle Friday when a new member that U.S. President Donald Trump appointed to a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances rejected the immediate filing of a debt restructuring proposal. Justin Peterson, who once advised creditors in financial disputes involving Puerto Rico and Argentina, abruptly dropped out of the board’s public meeting after clashing with them several times, leaving members without a quorum to approve the proposal. The other board members said they would continue negotiations with creditors as Puerto Rico restructures a portion of its more than $70B public debt load in an ongoing bankruptcy-like proceeding in federal court. However, the board members acknowledged they could not move forward with the plan without Peterson’s vote or unless new members are appointed to fill the three remaining vacancies on the seven-member board. “I’m hopeful that we will be able to revisit that decision soon,” said board chairman David Skeel in a press conference following the meeting, adding that he didn’t know when new members would be appointed. Before leaving the meeting, Peterson called the plan inequitable and nonconsensual. “They’re getting nothing,” he said of bondholders. In a series of tweets after the meeting, he said he disagreed with a last-minute proposal by a fellow board member to immediately file the plan without first negotiating with creditors. He called that unacceptable and said it was “emblematic of the game-playing and secrecy that has plagued these negotiations.” It is the biggest public clash the board has faced since U.S. Congress created the board in 2016, a year after Puerto Rico announced it could not pay its debt after decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing to balance budgets. In May 2017, it filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, just four months before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful Category 4 storm.",https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-financial-markets-puerto-rico-22fed18e991064949b981173d7422240,AP,Neutral

"Puerto Rico 911 shutdown creates confusion, anger",DÁNICA COTO,10/22/20,"Puerto Rico’s government said Thursday that it has restored 911 emergency service, but an overnight shutdown of the system led to furious criticism of officials accused of failing to take precautions during the coronavirus pandemic. Public Safety Secretary Pedro Janer told The Associated Press that 911 calls were now being automatically redirected to other agencies on the U.S. territory and said two dedicated emergency call centers would be back in service by Sunday at the latest. Janer provoked a storm of confusion on Wednesday night when he announced that that coronavirus infections at the call centers had forced officials to suspend 911 service. He told Puerto Ricans instead to call other, standard numbers for the police or emergency management agency. Callers to at least one of those numbers were confronted by an automated menu telling them to call 911 in an emergency. “That makes no sense,” Aramis Cruz, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 310, told the AP. “Imagine calling a switchboard during an emergency.” Thousands of Puerto Ricans took to social media to express outrage over the inability to dial 911 for roughly 10 hours. Many asked why government officials didn’t send an alert to people’s cellphones with the temporary numbers since they have already been sending alerts about a nightly coronavirus curfew. Puerto Rico’s 911 call centers receive between 9,000 to 12,000 calls a day, of which 35% to 40% are emergencies, Cruz said, though he said he wasn’t aware of any major emergencies that went unanswered during the shutdown. He said the union in March presented the government with a pandemic backup plan that would involve isolating workers and ensuring they could still perform their duties even if there was a COVID-19 breakout. “They told me it wasn’t necessary,” he said. Cruz said the 911 system also is underfunded and doesn’t have a way for operators to work remotely: “The system is obsolete.” He said two employees in each center had tested positive and that more test results are pending. Janer said officials had closed the 911 call centers for safety following the infections. “We are basically hostages of COVID-19,” he said. “It’s attacking when one least expects it.” When asked why the department didn’t have a backup plan other than asking people to call unknown 10-digit numbers during an emergency, he said, “That’s the most effective one we had at the moment.” Asked about the backup plan that union leaders presented in March, Janer said, “We keep learning as we encounter obstacles. ... We don’t have a crystal ball. ... We’re trying to anticipate things, but we’re human.” He said ordering new equipment or implementing procedural changes require approval from several local and federal agencies, processes slowed due to the pandemic. A spokeswoman for Yazmín González, commissioner of Puerto Rico’s 911 Emergency System Bureau, told the AP that she was not speaking to the media. Puerto Rico has reported more than 29,800 confirmed infections of the new coronavirus, as well as more than 29,000 suspected ones and more than 780 deaths related to COVID-19.",https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-latin-america-emergency-management-3f6a45525f720b639371e0c1445f4371,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico shutters 911 call centers amid coronavirus cases,DÁNICA COTO,10/22/20,"Both of Puerto Rico’s 911 call centers were shut down Wednesday night after several employees tested positive for the coronavirus, officials announced. Public Safety Secretary Pedro Janer said people should call the island’s emergency management agency at 787-724-0124 or police at 787-343-2020 in an emergency. He said both agencies are operating 24 hours a day. However, people calling the first number that Janer provided get a recording asking them to call 911 for an emergency. Then the recording provided callers with a directory. “This is serious,” Nazario Lugo, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Emergency Managers, told The Associated Press. He said he was shocked at the government’s temporary plan to handle emergencies in the U.S. territory of 3.2 million people. Lugo said officials should relay 911 calls through to another number, rather than forcing people to call a long number that they would have to read or hear about on the news. “Response times will definitely be affected,” he said. Kiara Hernández, a spokeswoman for the Public Safety Department, said she could not immediately comment on why officials were unable to automatically route emergency calls to another number. “It’s an option that’s being evaluated,” she said. She also said she didn’t know why officials decided to close both 911 centers before ensuring that such alternatives were in place. It is the first time Puerto Rico has shut down its primary and secondary 911 call centers. Janer said the buildings will be thoroughly cleaned and that he will soon announce when operations at the 911 call centers will resume. It was unclear how many employees tested positive. Puerto Rico has reported more than 29,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections. It has had more than 770 deaths from COVID-19, the disease that can be caused by the virus.",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-latin-america-c939e01656d5c0d2ce490ae9dbe8db46,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico, unable to vote, becomes crucial to US election",DÁNICA COTO and ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON,10/18/20,"The campaigns of President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are rallying people in a place where U.S. citizens cannot cast ballots but have the ear of hundreds of thousands of potential voters in the battleground state of Florida. The candidates are targeting Puerto Rico in a way never before seen, with the U.S. territory suddenly finding itself in the crosshairs of a high-stakes race even though Puerto Ricans on the island cannot vote in presidential elections despite being U.S. citizens since 1917. Campaigners know this, but they hope those on the island will push relatives and friends on the U.S. mainland to vote for them in a strategy that capitalizes on the close ties they share. It’s a novel role that plays off the sentiment that Puerto Ricans in Florida feel they are voting by proxy for those back home left out of U.S. democracy. And a growing number find this role appealing, especially since many on the island are struggling to recover from hurricanes Irma and Maria, a string of strong earthquakes, a deep economic crisis and the pandemic. “I’m voting for 3 million Puerto Ricans on the island, including my entire family,” said Jerick Mediavilla, who is from the mountain town of Corozal and is voting in a U.S. presidential election for the first time after moving to Orlando four years ago. “Puerto Rico doesn’t have a voice. Our voice is via the United States.” It’s people like Mediavilla that Democrats and Republicans are trying to target as they court Latinos in Florida, which has the largest population of Puerto Ricans in the U.S., with nearly 1.2 million. Trump won Florida in 2016 and has virtually no path to the White House if he doesn’t do so again. Polls are tight, and as the Trump campaign worries of support slipping among suburban and older voters, Latinos in Florida have become crucial. Puerto Ricans represent 27% of Hispanics of voting age in Florida, trailing only Cuban-Americans. While it’s unclear how many are Democrats or Republicans, Democrats have widened the gap of Hispanic voters registered for this election over the GOP compared with 2016. The gains were in counties with a high number of Puerto Ricans including Orange County, home to Orlando, and Hillsborough, home to Tampa. Polk County, where the Puerto Rican population has more than doubled since 2013, saw the fastest growth of Latino registered voters, with Democrats registering 21,000 more voters than Republicans. The gap in 2016 was 15,000. But those same counties also have a very high number of voters registered without party affiliation. “Puerto Ricans will play a very crucial role in this election,” said Yadira Sánchez, co-executive director of Poder Latinx, a U.S.-based non-profit group that aims to mobilize Latino voters. Election observers, however, note Puerto Ricans have weaker voter turnout rates than other Hispanic groups that favor Republican candidates.  Trump recently secured an endorsement from Puerto Rico’s governor and promised nearly $13 billion in additional aid last month to help the island rebuild from Hurricane Maria. During a recent rally in Florida, Trump declared: “I’m not gonna say the best, but I’m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico.” Many were quick to note that those living on the island don’t have that right. Meanwhile, Biden granted an exclusive interview to Puerto Rico’s main newspaper that for the first time in its 50 years endorsed a U.S. presidential candidate and asked those in the U.S. mainland to support Biden: “We ask that you, with the great power of your vote, especially in key electoral states, help open the way to the transformation effort that will honor the dignity and promote the progress of every person.”  Biden recently launched digital and print ads on the island with the hashtag “HazloXMi,” or DoItForMe, urging Puerto Ricans to tell their friends and family on the U.S. mainland to participate: “With your vote over there, you help us here.” “Both campaigns are doing it thinking this will bounce back to Florida,” said Carlos Suárez, a political science professor at the University of Florida. It’s unclear whether the indirect campaign strategy will work, but Luis Gutiérrez, a former U.S. representative who served 26 years in Congress and now lives in Puerto Rico, called it a smart move. Puerto Ricans “are always in contact. Why? Because whether you’re one of 3 million on the island or 5 million somewhere else, you’re part of one community,” the Democrat said. “If you are born in Puerto Rico, it will be part of your life until the last day.” As the election draws near, pressure keeps growing on Puerto Ricans on the island and on the mainland. A Florida political group recently created a song set to the tune of “Rakatá” by Wisin y Yandel, a renowned Puerto Rican reggaeton duo who first became popular in the early 2000s. The song encourages Puerto Ricans who moved to Florida to use their new voting power and hurl a “chancleta” or flip-flop at Trump to help those living on the island: “He doesn’t care one bit for Boricuas.” Trump’s campaign has countered with ads highlighting the billions of dollars his administration has pledged to help Puerto Rico recover from Maria, a Category 4 storm that caused an estimated $100 billion in damage and killed an estimated 2,975 people in its aftermath. However, the administration withheld billions of dollars in emergency aid for months, saying it worried about mismanagement and corruption on the island. Wyneska Méndez, who moved to Miami from Puerto Rico eight years ago, said she would not let fellow Puerto Ricans influence her decision, adding that Trump is the only choice to protect the economy. She especially likes that Trump feels strongly against abortion because of her Christian faith, and she believes Puerto Rico needed to get its affairs in order to receive the same kind of relief offered to U.S. states. “I don’t let others get in my head,” Méndez said as she waited for a speech by Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday in Miami. Dozens of Trump supporters who gathered Sunday in Puerto Rico for a rally shared her sentiment, saying the president has sent billions of dollars to help with hurricane reconstruction as they praised his pro-life stance.  Dr. Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, a former senator and member of Puerto Rico’s pro-statehood party, said that Trump’s personality can be misinterpreted and that she believes he was joking when making comments about the island that critics have found offensive. “There have been many erroneous messages from certain Puerto Ricans toward Trump, and we don’t want people to think that all Puerto Ricans are the same,” Ramírez said as she pulled down the face mask of a fellow Trump supporter decorated with bald eagles and U.S. flags. Despite the aid Puerto Rico has received under the Trump administration, Mediavilla and his brother, Omar, who lives in Puerto Rico, remain unswayed. “It’s a great help, but really, in the end, I see it as a political strategy,” said Omar Mediavilla, adding that he is grateful his brother was motivated by the aftermath of Maria to support Biden. “They’re our voice carrying our complaints ... It’s important that Puerto Ricans over there give us this opportunity.” Some who live on the island remain wary of the campaigning to influence Puerto Ricans on the mainland. Omar Soto, a production supervisor whose brother lives in Lakeland, Florida, said the strategies are pointless. “It seems like there’s a tone of despair,” he said, adding that he believes it could backfire. “I think it’s disrespectful. We should have the option to vote for president.” ___ Associated Press writer Danica Coto reported this story in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and AP writer Adriana Gomez Licon reported from Miami.",https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-race-and-ethnicity-joe-biden-donald-trump-puerto-rico-3018eade64921c72b0ebb1df3f22061e,AP,Neutral

Starting Saturday, capacity at restaurants will increase from 50% to 55%, while capacity at theaters, gyms and casinos will increase from 25% to 30%. Business owners had been demanding that capacity increase by at least 60% given an economic crisis that the pandemic has worsened.

"Navigating by mango trees, pink houses in rural Puerto Rico",DÁNICA COTO,10/8/20,"Firefighters in this city near Puerto Rico’s capital cheered when they recently got updated maps that include rural neighborhoods, confessing they sometimes had to rely on taxi drivers for directions during emergencies. That’s because more than 300,000 homes on the island have no formal address. The absence of street names and numbers across the island has long been a problem for the U.S. territory, where internet map services sometimes fail. Directions can involve a mango tree, or a bakery or a house of a certain color. It’s even a problem in urban areas, like one district of the capital, San Juan, where some people rely on a life-size Bigfoot doll on a balcony as a reference point for directions to a hospital. It’s not unusual to hear something like: “Turn right at kilometer 58 and make a left after a large hole. If you go past the big breadfruit tree, you’ve gone too far.” Oso Blanco prison, nicknamed the Alcatraz of the Caribbean where hundreds of inmates were killed, is still used as a reference point even though crews demolished it long ago. So getting lost has long been an acceptable and occasional fun part of island life for some, but the coronavirus pandemic, a recent series of earthquakes and increasingly active hurricane seasons are prodding authorities to resolve the problem. Without an address, emergency responders cannot find people quickly or deliver basic supplies or medical care when up to 60% of homes in some municipalities lack one. “If you’re not on a map, you don’t exist,” said Raúl Ríos, a former manager at the U.S. Postal Service who now leads iCasaPR, a nonprofit group that aims to standardize addresses on the island. Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities and dozens of government agencies still use separate databases that use different names for the same streets or list the same addresses in varying ways, such as 1013 or 10-13. “It’s like the Tower of Babel,” Ríos said. Four years ago, a young boy died in San Juan because it took an ambulance 15 minutes to find the apartment in a complex that did not have a standardized address, said Nazario Lugo, the president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Emergency Responders who was the city’s emergency management director at the time. And the mother could not go outside to flag down emergency responders because she was following CPR directions from the 911 operator, he said. The problem is so widespread the government even recommends that a home emergency plan include designating someone to go out to a main road to flag down emergency responders. As in other cities, officials here in Caguas want to avoid such tragedies. Over the past decade, more than 100 roads have been named for the first time, but there are many more that need identities and it’s not always easy, said Carmen Díaz, auxiliary planning director. Street names have to be unique and they are limited to 28 characters, so to help neighborhoods come up with ideas Díaz bought books on Puerto Rican plants and animals, novels by famous local authors and even suggested the name of the song “Calma” by Puerto Rican pop singer Pedro Capó. Díaz said the practice of using landmarks to give directions is not sustainable: “They’ve already changed the color of that pink house or cut down that tree.” It’s those types of directions that Caguas resident Luz Martínez used to rely on before her neighborhood got street names and house numbers. She even told visitors to ask for her well-known neighbor “Nazario” if they got lost en route to her house. “It was very complicated,” she said. As president of La Unión community, Martínez held a vote on potential street names. Among the winners: José Díaz Dede, who ran an informal grocery delivery service, and Antonia Díaz, who campaigned to pave their streets.  José Díaz Dede learned his name won while in a nursing home, but he died before he could see the sign go up. Antonia Díaz, who is 106, still lives on the street named for her. Not everyone, though, wants to be on a map. Ríos said some people resist because they have added a swimming pool or other feature to their home without permits. Others simply want to live off the grid. And many people have their official addresses listed as post office boxes — with clusters of rusting boxes dotting rural routes around the island — and don’t want to have to switch to a new address.",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-san-juan-archive-723960c28989ccfeccab55244994c384,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico extends COVID-19 measures amid testing errors,DÁNICA COTO,10/2/20,"Puerto Rico’s government has extended measures to fight COVID-19 for two more weeks, meaning that restaurants, gyms and theaters across the U.S. territory will keep operating at limited capacity. In addition, a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew will remain in place until Oct. 16, and face masks continue to be mandatory, according to an executive order that the interim governor signed late Thursday. The extension was not publicly announced, and no press conference with health experts was held as has been customary since the pandemic began. Gov. Wanda Vázquez is on an official trip in the U.S. mainland until next week. The extension also means bars and clubs will stay closed, and public school classes will continue to be held online. Health experts had recommended the extension following recent testing problems at Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest laboratories on the island. Officials are reviewing 6,000 tests done last month after discovering that some of them yielded inaccurate results. “We cannot make recommendations to open or close until we’ve validated the data,” Dr. Víctor Ramos, president of the Association of Surgeons, said in a phone interview. If the tests turn out to be all positive, it’s an indication Puerto Rico is still struggling with the pandemic, Ramos said. If they turn out to be all negative, it would mean the situation is greatly improving, he added. A laboratory spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.

Trans person shot in Puerto Rico in 6th killing this year,DÁNICA COTO,9/30/20,"Authorities said a transgender woman was fatally shot Wednesday in southwest Puerto Rico, the sixth such killing this year. Michelle Ramos Vargas, 33, was found along an isolated road near a farm in the town of San German, according to officials, who said they were investigating whether it was a hate crime. Police officer Manuel Cruz told The Associated Press that the victim had apparently worked as a bartender and was studying nursing and was shot several times in the head. Human rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano condemned the killing and said trans people in the U.S. territory are being hunted. “Enough of so much hate,” he said in a statement. “Trans people are as human as everyone else and deserve to live in peace, equality and freedom.” The bodies of two transgender women were found inside a charred car in southeast Puerto Rico in April. The FBI took over the investigation after two men were arrested in that case. Also that month, a transgender woman was killed in prison. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old transsexual man was shot in the western town of Moca in March and a person identified as Neulisa Luciano Ruiz was found dead in the northern town of Toa Baja in February.

"Trump shifts on Puerto Rico, releases aid as election nears",BEN FOX,9/18/20,"President Donald Trump announced the release Friday of $13 billion in assistance to repair years-old hurricane damage in Puerto Rico and pledged to restore its economy, setting aside his past bitter treatment of the island and its leaders as he courts Puerto Rican voters in the U.S., particularly in the crucial swing state of Florida. Trump has spent much of his administration blasting Puerto Rican officials as corrupt and inept, and he has opposed spending to rebuild a power grid and other infrastructure that was wiped out by the Hurricane Maria in September 2017. He’s now portraying himself as the territory’s best friend. “I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico,” he said at a White House press conference, “no one even close.” Residents of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of more than 3 million people, cannot vote in the general election. But there are more people of Puerto Rican descent on the mainland than on the island, and they could play a key role in the Nov. 3 vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden has also sought support from Puerto Ricans, recently releasing a recovery plan for the territory and visiting central Florida. The region has one of the largest concentrations of people from the island on the U.S. mainland, including many who fled the devastation of Hurricane Maria. The hurricane slammed into the island with winds of 155 mph, causing an estimated $100 billion in damage and killing nearly 3,000 people, according to an official death toll that Trump has said was exaggerated to make him look bad. The grant announced Friday includes nearly $10 billion to rebuild an electrical grid that was wiped out by the storm and resulted in the longest blackout in U.S. history. Asked why the aid was coming now, less than 50 days before the election, Trump insisted his administration had been working on getting it done but it was held up by Democrats in Congress. In fact, they approved the funding and pushed for its release.  Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, a New York Democrat, took note of the timing of Trump’s assistance so close to the election. “The Trump Administration delayed, dragged its feet and resisted allocating these badly needed funds,” said Velázquez, who was born in Puerto Rico. “Now, forty-six days before the election, the administration has finally seen fit to release these funds.” Trump in the past has opposed providing additional aid to Puerto Rico, arguing it had received too much already and expressing concern that the money would be wasted or misspent. In the aftermath of the storm, he publicly feuded with the mayor of San Juan over her criticism of his administration’s response. And he irritated many by tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd during a visit to an island church. Democrats earlier this year posted an image of the scene on a billboard in Kissimmee, a heavily Puerto Rican city in central Florida. Trump dismissed that history as he discussed the aid disbursement and pledged to revitalize Puerto Rico’s pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturing industry, which has been in decline in part due to the 1996 repeal of tax incentives. “I think you are going to see a rebuilding of Puerto Rico,” he said.  Even now, three years after the storm, thousands of homes are still damaged. The island has also been hit by a series of damaging earthquakes and remains mired in a deep economic crisis, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.  Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said the Trump administration “dithered and delayed” and lost time that could have been used to help Puerto Rico emerge stronger from the storm.  “After the storms utterly destroyed the grid, it created an opportunity to rebuild a cleaner, cheaper and more resilient energy system, but the Trump administration dithered and delayed and refused to deliver timely disaster aid for the people of Puerto Rico,” Schumer said. The White House said $9.6 billion of the new funding is intended to help the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines, electrical substations, power generation systems, office buildings, and make other grid improvements.  It said $2 billion would be for the Puerto Rico Department of Education to repair schools across the island. With this latest grant, the White House said the government has allocated about $26 billion for the island’s recovery from Hurricane Maria. Congress has approved about $43 billion.  In October, the island’s government announced a 10-year plan to modernize and strengthen the power grid  at a projected cost of around $20 billion.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-storms-politics-joe-biden-hurricanes-02c9eba973414d44f2f24cc06a2871da,AP,Neutral
White House announces nearly $13 billion in aid for Puerto Rico three years after Hurricane Maria,Lisa Lambert,9/18/20,"The U.S. emergency agency is sending almost $13 billion to Puerto Rico, directed at the territory’s energy and education systems, to help it recover from 2017’s devastating Hurricane Maria, the White House said on Friday. The “federal share” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s grants to the territory totals $11. 6 billion, with most money, $9. 6 billion, going to the battered power authority, according to a White House announcement, which did not provide details on the remaining funds or explain why they were not part of the federal share. Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced said in a statement the full FEMA package is $12. 8 billion, with $10. 5 billion for power. The White House said the aid exceeds the total public assistance funding in any single federallydeclared disaster other than Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the destructive 2005 storms. According to the National Hurricane Center, Maria is the third costliest hurricane in U.S. history behind Katrina and 2017’s Hurricane Harvey. Top Democrats said President Donald Trump had delayed and withheld the aid for the last three years, stunting Puerto Rico’s ability to rebuild from the storm that killed more than 2,500 people and left the island without power for weeks. Representative Nydia Velazquez said he was “blatantly playing politics” by announcing the package 46 days before the Nov. 3 election, where he is in a tight race against Democrat Joe Biden. Both Trump and Biden have been working to woo Hispanic voters. Their support is considered critical in the perennial swing state of Florida, where many Puerto Ricans relocated after Maria. Puerto Rico was already struggling financially before Maria struck, and filed a form of municipal bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and obligations. A large portion of its financial distress was linked to the power utility. Since then, it has weathered more hurricanes, earthquakes, the coronavirus pandemic and political upheaval, as well as increased federal scrutiny into its use of U.S. aid.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puerto-rico-idUKKBN26924B,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico reopening beaches, gyms, theaters amid pandemic",DÁNICA COTO,9/10/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Thursday announced she would reopen beaches, casinos, gyms and movie theaters across the U.S. territory as officials report a recent drop in COVID-19 cases and deaths that some experts worry could once again spike. The changes will be in effect from Saturday until Oct. 2. Face masks and social distancing, especially at the beach, remain mandatory, bars and clubs will stay closed and a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew will continue.  “We cannot lower our guard,” said Gov. Wanda Vázquez. “There’s an invisible enemy in our environment, and we have to learn to deal with him.” The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 500 deaths, along with more than 17,000 confirmed cases and another 19,000 probable ones. More than 420 people remain hospitalized. Dr. José Rodríguez Orengo with the Puerto Rico Public Health Trust, told The Associated Press that the pandemic on the island has improved in the past three weeks. “It’s all going to depend on people’s behavior to maintain that,” he said. Vázquez said there were some 3,900 fewer COVID-19 cases since Aug. 22, compared with the nearly four weeks leading up to that date. In addition, she said there were 162 deaths from Aug. 1-21, compared with 88 deaths from Aug. 22 until Sept. 10. As part of the new executive order, Vázquez said she will lift a 24-hour lockdown on Sundays and allow restaurants to increase their capacity from 25% to 50%. She also ordered most public workers to return to their offices on Sept. 14, although public schools will continue to hold classes online. Beaches, which had been open only to those doing exercise including surfers and joggers, will now reopen to everyone. Many business owners praised the changes given the island’s decade-long economic crisis and the financial impact that hurricanes Maria and Irma and a recent string of earthquakes have already had on Puerto Rico’s fragile economy. But some of the upcoming changes raised concerns among independent health experts who worried about another spike in cases like the one that occurred after Vázquez announced similar reopenings in early June, which led to stricter measures in August. Epidemiologist Roberta Lugo told the AP that such a wide-ranging easing of measures was worrisome especially given that contact tracing and monitoring systems have not been fully implemented, and that businesses are largely expected to auto-regulate themselves. She warned there would be a rise in cases and deaths given the reopening of places such as casinos, gyms and theaters, which she said are considered high-risk places. “One gets frustrated,” she said. “What are we going to do when October comes? Impose another round of restrictions?...Puerto Rico cannot afford to repeat what happened in August.”",https://apnews.com/0eb37978676268a56ed31a05fa88090b,AP,Neutral
New project to probe Hurricane Maria deaths in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,9/9/20,"U.S. researchers who estimated that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria are now investigating deaths that might have been missed and could be linked to infrastructure damaged by the Category 4 storm, officials announced Wednesday. The Milken Institute of Public Health at George Washington University received a nearly $1 million contract from the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the investigation. University officials said the project seeks to improve the death certification process and building standards across the U.S. mainland ahead of future storms as part of a collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico and others. The investigation also aims to identify all direct and indirect deaths linked to building and infrastructure failures in the first two weeks after Maria struck on Sept. 20, 2017, including finding clusters of deaths tied to critical facilities such as hospitals and schools. Yaritsa Santiago, whose mother died after she was airlifted from Puerto Rico to Miami shortly after Maria struck, praised the upcoming investigation and said she was encouraged that the storm-related deaths will not be in vain. Her mother had been scheduled to undergo an operation for heart problems in October that was indefinitely postponed as a result of the hurricane. “I think it’s fantastic they’re creating this awareness,” Santiago, who lives in Tampa, said in a phone interview. “A lot of people had to leave Puerto Rico and died elsewhere...Following up is very important to avoid this happening in the future.” It is one of four projects that studies the impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and launched by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a non-regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The $5 million investigation is only the fourth one conducted by the institute. The others focused on the World Trade Center towers, a Rhode Island nightclub fire and the 2011 tornado that hit Joplin, Missouri. “This isn’t a traditional research project,” Judith Mitrani-Reiser, who leads the institution’s division overseeing the Hurricane Maria investigation, said in a phone interview.  She said that it will take several years to complete and that researchers will review government data, interview families of victims and focus on hospital, schools and shelters. “We’re trying to understand how people died,” she said. Carlos Santos Burgoa, a professor at the Milken Institute who will lead the project, said in a statement that he hopes it also will help experts quickly and accurately count deaths following a natural disaster. The NIST has said it chose to study the impact of Maria in Puerto Rico over Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Irma in Florida because of the sustained wind speeds greater than 140 mph (225 kph) across a broad region, damage from wind, flooding and landslides, loss of critical services and a prolonged recovery. Puerto Rico’s government at the time came under heavy criticism for severely undercounting the number of deaths related to Hurricane Maria, which destroyed the power grid and caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage. The government later raised the official death toll from 64 to 2,975 following an independent study by George Washington researchers who found that people succumbed in the sweltering aftermath and that doctors were not trained in how to classify deaths after a disaster.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-storms-archive-hurricanes-eb7298b32bdfb95116d45cba3b42444c,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico imposes stricter measures amid coronavirus spike,DÁNICA COTO,8/19/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Wednesday that she will place the U.S. territory on a 24-hour lockdown every Sunday as part of stricter measures to fight a spike in coronavirus cases. Gyms, theaters and bars will remain closed and only restaurants with outdoor areas will be allowed to seat people, but at 25% capacity. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said violators will be shut down for a month. In addition, beaches will remain open only to those doing exercise such as runners and surfers, and businesses, malls and banks will be allowed to operate at only 25% capacity. The new measures go into effect Saturday and will remain in place until Sept. 11. Face masks remain mandatory. “We have to adjust to living in a new reality,” Vázquez said, blaming the jump in cases on “careless” people. Vázquez also said it remains to be seen whether in-person classes at public schools will start in mid-September as scheduled.  “We are approaching a terrible autumn,” she said. A 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in place from Monday to Saturday, and on Sundays, only people going to pharmacies, grocery stores, hospitals or medical appointments will be allowed to leave home.  The announcement was welcomed by health experts, but many said the new measures should have been implemented last week as cases continue to soar. The U.S. territory of 3.2 million people has reported more than 12,400 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and at least 356 deaths, including that of a 19-year-old woman announced Wednesday. Among those who have tested positive is Carlos Méndez, president of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives. A 24-hour record of 644 cases were reported Aug. 4, Dr. José Rodríguez Orengo with the Puerto Rico Public Health Trust told The Associated Press. “It was a number we had never before seen,” he said. “This pandemic is still on the rise.” However, Rodríguez noted Puerto Rico is not yet reporting worrisome numbers of people in intensive care units or on respirators, which he said reflects the fact that 80% of people who have been infected are younger than 60. He blamed the spike in cases on people coming from the U.S. mainland to visit family and friends, a lack of a robust contact tracing system and a weak educational campaign. “At one point, we had the virus under control. Now the virus has us under its control,” he said.",https://apnews.com/98573c518820399152d8c43b55d03de7,AP,Neutral
Broken cable damages giant radio telescope in Puerto Rico,No Author,8/11/20,"A broken cable caused severe damage at Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory, causing a suspension of operations for one of the world’s largest single-dish radio telescopes, officials said Tuesday. The University of Central Florida, which manages the National Science Foundation facility, said in a statement that a cable that helps support a metal platform broke and caused a 100-foot (30-meter) gash on a reflector dish. The university said eight panels in the dome also were damaged and the platform used to access the dome is now twisted. The statement said it was unclear why the cable broke. The cost of the damage wasn’t immediately known. Scientists worldwide use the telescope to detect radio emissions emitted by objects such as stars and galaxies.

Puerto Rico gov sues elections commission in primary debacle,DÁNICA COTO,8/11/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Tuesday added new demands to conflicting proposals for rescuing the U.S. territory’s botched primary election, suing to insist on an election re-do at all polling centers that opened late — not just those where a lack of ballots kept people from voting, The lawsuit filed by Gov. Wanda Vázquez also seeks to stop the release of unconfirmed results from centers where voting did take place on Sunday. The island’s Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. A failure to supply ballots and other issues kept people from voting at a little under half of the island’s 110 polling places. “The uncertainty created since the process began in the morning hours caused thousands of voters to leave the voting centers where chaos and confusion reigned,” according Vazquez’s lawsuit, filed before the Court of First Instance. Electoral officials have agreed to try to repair the problem by holding a second wave of voting this Sunday at centers where no one voted due to a lack of missing or delayed ballots. Vázquez wants the re-do to include centers that opened late as well.  A federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances announced Tuesday that it has authorized $1.27 million for the second round of votes, warning in a letter that “the efficiency in the use of these funds is paramount.” Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court is expect to rule this week on four other lawsuits spawned by the election problems. Pedro Pierluisi, who is running against Vázquez in the primary of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, seeks to have the votes cast so far tallied and made public. Also suing for the same reason are Sen. Eduardo Bhatia and Carlos Delgado, mayor of the northwest coastal town of Isabela, two of three gubernatorial nominees for the main opposition Popular Democratic Party. That party supports Puerto Rico’s current political status as a U.S. territory and held a primary for the first time in its 82-year history. A fourth lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union for a female voter who wants the entire primary scrapped and started anew. Electoral officials have acknowledged that ballots arrived at their offices days behind schedule and were still being dispatched to polling places on the day of the vote — often never arriving. It was the first time primaries have been halted in the territory and led many to worry that it has damaged Puerto Ricans’ confidence in their government and could affect the outcome of upcoming November general elections on an island that typically has a voter participation rate of nearly 70%.",https://apnews.com/article/primary-elections-puerto-rico-lawsuits-elections-latin-america-2b463db62617b87153eceeb337af8aa6,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico halts primary voting in centers lacking ballots,DÁNICA COTO,8/10/20,"Puerto Rico on Sunday was forced to partially suspend voting for primaries marred by a lack of ballots as officials called on the president of the U.S. territory’s elections commission to resign. The primaries for voting centers that had not received ballots by early afternoon are expected to be rescheduled, while voting would continue elsewhere, the commission said. “I have never seen on American soil something like what has just been done here in Puerto Rico. It’s an embarrassment to our government and our people,” said Pedro Pierluisi, who is running against Gov. Wanda Vázquez, to become the nominee for the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Meanwhile, Vázquez called the situation “a disaster” and demanded the resignation of the president of the elections commission. “They made the people of Puerto Rico, not the candidates, believe that they were prepared,” she said. “Today the opposite was evident. They lied.” A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances issued a statement saying the “dysfunctional” voting process was unacceptable and blamed it on what it said was inefficiency by the elections commission. The unprecedented situation comes as voters ventured out amid a spike in COVID-19 cases across Puerto Rico, an island of 3.2 million people that has reported more than 12,800 probable cases, more than 8,500 confirmed cases and at least 274 deaths. Gireliz Zambrana, a 31-year-old federal employee, worried about the number of people gathered at a voting center in Río Grande as they huddled together while waiting for it to open. “They were trying to get away from the sun,” he said, adding that he never got to cast his vote. The president of the governor’s party, Thomas Rivera Schatz, along with the president of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, held an unusual joint press conference and said they agreed the remaining primaries should be held on Aug. 16, a move that Vázquez said she supported. The two parties are both holding their primary elections with the winning nominees among six gubernatorial candidates in November’s general election.  Other politicians argued that the entire primary be scrapped and held at another date. An incredulous Schatz noted that there were still trucks with ballots inside parked at the commission’s headquarters as they spoke there on Sunday afternoon. “The question is, why haven’t they left?” he said. It was not immediately clear how many voters were turned away or how many centers received delayed ballots. A commission spokeswoman said the president was not granting interviews. To further complicate things, Edgardo Román, president of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press that it’s unclear what alternatives are legally viable because the island’s electoral law is not clear. “It doesn’t contemplate this scenario,” he said. At least one voter filed a lawsuit against the commission and the electoral officials of the two main parties late Sunday via the American Civil Liberties Union.  The situation infuriated voters and politicians of all stripes as they blamed Puerto Rico’s elections commission and demanded an explanation for ballots reaching only a handful of voting centers by the afternoon. “This is indignant, abusive and an attempt against the democracy of our country,” said Marcos Cruz, mayor of the northern town of Vega Baja that was still awaiting ballots. Meanwhile, officials from the island’s two main parties scrambled to find solutions as they urged voters to still show up at centers that remained open late into the night. Yadira Pizarro, a 44-year-old teacher, ran out of patience at a shuttered voting center in Carolina where she had waited more than four hours under a blistering sun. “I cannot believe this. This is some serious negligence,” she said. One of the most closely watched races on Sunday is that of the pro-statehood Progressive New Party, which pits two candidates who served as replacement governors following last year’s political turmoil. Vázquez faces Pierluisi, who represented Puerto Rico in Congress from 2009 to 2017.  Pierluisi briefly served as governor after Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned in August 2019 following widespread street protests over a profanity-laced chat that was leaked and government corruption. But Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court ruled that Vázquez, then the justice secretary, was constitutionally next in line because there was no secretary of state. Meanwhile, the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports Puerto Rico’s current political status as a U.S. territory, is holding a primary for the first time in its 82-year history. Three people are vying to become governor — San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, known for her public spats with U.S. President Donald Trump following the devastation of Hurricane Maria; Puerto Rico Sen. Eduardo Bhatia; and Carlos Delgado, mayor of the northwest coastal town of Isabela.",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-puerto-rico-san-juan-elections-cc71c04f2a242a6e1d22cbc7cf02f139,AP,Neutral
"4.8 earthquake shakes southern Puerto Rico, rattling many",No Author,8/7/20,"A magnitude 4.8 earthquake struck southern Puerto Rico late Thursday at a shallow depth in the same region that has not stopped shaking since late December. The quake hit near the southern town of Guayanilla at a depth of 7 miles (12 kilometers), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The tremor initially was reported with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1. No immediate damage was reported, although many Puerto Ricans were jolted from their beds. “It was felt everywhere,” Víctor Huérfano, director of the island’s seismic network, told The Associated Press.

U.S. lawmakers seek probe of investment firms' dealings in Puerto Rico debt,Karen Pierog,8/5/20,"Five members of U.S. Congress from New York said on Wednesday that several investment firms involved in Puerto Rico’s ongoing bankruptcy may have engaged in insider trading and urged the state attorney general to investigate. FILE PHOTO: The Capitol building is seen in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin Baez/File PhotoIn a letter to New York Attorney General Letitia James, the lawmakers cited allegations arising from the island’s bankruptcy litigation “that some hedge fund groups may have been engaging in insider trading and using the PROMESA restructuring process to artificially manipulate bond markets. ”Using the 2016 PROMESA Act, Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board filed a form of municipal bankruptcy for the U.S. commonwealth in 2017 in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of debt and obligations. “Not only is this another example of deep pocketed interests profiteering off Puerto Ricans’ suffering, but these hedge funds may have also violated securities law,” U.S. Representative Nydia Velázquez, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. The letter, which was also signed by Congress members Alexandria OcasioCortez, Carolyn Maloney, José Serrano, and Adriano Espaillat, pointed out that the federal judge overseeing the bankruptcy ordered detailed disclosures from the Lawful Constitutional Debt Coalition (LCDC), whose members include Aristeia Capital LLC, Whitebox Advisors LLC, Taconic Capital Advisors LP, and GoldenTree Asset Management. Those disclosures revealed that LCDC members “significantly increased their holdings of bonds they argued in court were of no value while engaging in confidential mediation talks about their restructuring,” according to the letter. Meanwhile, the bonds increased in value “and the restructuring plan revealed at the end of the mediation period increased their return. ” The LCDC was part of a global settlement announced in February to restructure Puerto Rico’s core government debt. “An investigation is needed to reveal whether some hedge funds may have made these trades with nonpublic information obtained through the mediation discussions, and without disclosing their true economic interests,” the letter said. In a statement, the LCDC said its members “adhered to and respected all elements of the mediation protocol and trading restrictions during the period in which they were negotiating with the oversight board. ”“As creditors with longterm investments in Puerto Rico, our members have consistently engaged in a constructive, transparent manner with the oversight board to facilitate the commonwealth’s timely emergence from bankruptcy and economic recovery,” it added. The individual firms listed in the letter did not immediately respond to requests for comment or deferred to the LCDC statement. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General’s office said: “We’re reviewing the letter now, and will look further into this matter. ” The oversight board declined to comment.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN25134R,Reuters,Neutral
CEO of Puerto Rico’s power company to resign amid outages,DÁNICA COTO,8/3/20,"The CEO of Puerto Rico’s state-owned power company is resigning as thousands of clients remain without electricity since last week’s tropical storm that further weakened a grid still trying to recover from previous hurricanes and earthquakes, officials said Monday. José Ortiz is expected to step down on Wednesday amid widespread anger and impatience with ongoing power outages that are occurring during a pandemic, at the height of what is expected to be an unusually active hurricane season as hundreds of thousands of parents prepare for the start of a virtual school year. “It’s irresponsible and a lack of respect that a simple storm unleashed the chaos we have now,” said Natalia Núñez, who lives in San Juan and has been without power since Thursday. Many Puerto Ricans also are dissatisfied with how the Electric Power Authority handled recent outages including one last week that was not storm-related and left more than 300,000 customers without power. Then Isaias swiped the island as a tropical storm, leaving more than 400,000 more clients in the dark. By Monday afternoon, more than 20,000 customers were still without power. “That is not normal,” Walberto Rolón, a secretary for UTIER, a power workers’ union, told The Associated Press. “We don’t have employees or suitable equipment...this is something that can be fixed.” Rolón and others celebrated Ortiz’s upcoming resignation, accusing him and other company officials of improvising as outages continue.  Gov. Wanda Vázquez said the announcement comes after she met with the president of the power company’s board to demand it take all necessary action as she questioned the outages and the way officials handled the storm.  Ortiz had become the company’s third CEO in two weeks when he was appointed to the position in July 2018 as the island struggled to recover from a lack of leadership, bankruptcy and outages caused by Hurricane Maria. He said on Monday that at the time he committed to the position for two years. “My resignation comes at an appropriate moment in the transformation of PREPA into the modern electric utility all Puerto Ricans deserve,” Ortiz said in a statement. Last week, Ortiz blamed the outage prior to the storm on what he said was sabotage or human error, saying it was done manually. However, the company’s head of transmission and distribution disputed that conclusion, saying it was too early to say what happened. Meanwhile, the company’s 1.5 million customers grow increasingly exasperated with the ongoing outages. Among them is Laura Mejía, a mother of two who lives in an impoverished neighborhood and was forced to throw out food when she was left without power for three days a week before Isaias skirted the island.  “We spent three days without sleep,” she said, noting that recent heat indexes have surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. “We were incommunicados and didn’t even have a fan because we don’t have a generator.”",https://apnews.com/article/u-s-news-puerto-rico-tropical-storms-san-juan-storms-c2e72d1136103a14d31487322eb40c7c,AP,Neutral
Judge: ‘Discriminatory’ to deny Puerto Rico access to US aid,DÁNICA COTO,8/3/20,"A federal judge on Monday ruled that it is unconstitutional to deny Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. territory access to three federal welfare programs in a major decision cheered by many. However, the judge also granted a two-month administrative stay of the injunction at the federal government’s request, which means the decision for now will apply only to the nine plaintiffs in the case. Legal experts warned that they expect the U.S. government to appeal the ruling, and if unsuccessful, to take it as far as the U.S. Supreme Court given the millions of dollars at stake. “It’s a precedent, it’s a significant change, without a doubt. Whether it will be historic depends on its prevalence,” Edgardo Román, president of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. A U.S. Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the decision. In a 70-page ruling, Judge William G. Young called it a discriminatory policy to deny Puerto Ricans Supplemental Security Income, which provides extra income for the elderly, blind, or disabled; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps; and Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy, which helps cover the cost of a prescription drug plan. “The federal safety net is flimsier and more porous in Puerto Rico than in the rest of the nation,” he wrote. “To be blunt, the federal government discriminates against Americans who live in Puerto Rico.” Young noted that the U.S. territory of 3.2 million people has a 43% poverty rate, and that the nine plaintiffs are poor enough to qualify for at least one of the three federal welfare programs. He noted that the Northern Mariana Islands have access to SSI benefits, and Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands to SNAP, a program that Puerto Rico once had access to until Congress revoked eligibility in 1981. Meanwhile, he said Congress funds substitute programs in Puerto Rico, “but they are less generous by far,” offering less coverage and smaller benefits. “There is no doubt that the constitutional violations here are systemic,” Young wrote. He acknowledged that the U.S. government has provided three rationales for excluding Puerto Rico residents from the programs: cost, potential disruption to the island’s economy and the fact that those living on the island are generally exempt from paying the personal federal income tax. However, Young in part argued that Congress could have spread out benefit reductions equally, and that poor people generally do not pay income tax regardless of where they live. He also noted that from 2000 to 2005, Puerto Rico residents paid more in federal taxes than six states and all other U.S. territories combined. In addition, he wrote that in fiscal year 2019, the federal government collected more than $3.5 billion in taxes from Puerto Rico residents. Young’s decision also is expected to generate even more discussion about Puerto Rico’s political status as voters face an upcoming non-binding referendum on whether they support statehood. ___ Associated Press writer Mike Balsamo in Washington, D.C. contributed to this story.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-u-s-news-courts-latin-america-bce8ae96cb6a466f966a2a3a229cf9f0,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico extends anti-coronavirus measures for 2 weeks,DÁNICA COTO,7/31/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Friday that she would extend for two more weeks measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. That means bars, gyms, marinas and movie theaters across the U.S. territory will stay shuttered until at least Aug. 15. Beaches remain closed on Sundays, and are open the rest of the week only to people doing exercise, including surfers, swimmers and runners. Face masks continue to be mandatory, and those who refuse to wear one will be arrested, Gov. Wanda Vázquez said.  A curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. will remain in place, and no parties or gatherings will be allowed in short-term rental facilities. “Until a vaccine is found ... we all have to do our part,” the governor said. Meanwhile, Carla Campos, executive director of Puerto Rico’s tourism company, said arrivals dropped 25% and reservations fell 84% just last week alone. She and other officials cited as one factor recent pandemic measures, including a requirement that a visitor present a negative virus test upon arrival. “It is definitely not the time to be flying,” Campos said. Vázquez’s administration has repeatedly sought permission from the federal government to temporarily halt flights from COVID-19 hot spots in the U.S. mainland to no avail. The U.S. territory of 3.2 million people has reported more than 5,900 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 219 deaths.

Thousands in Puerto Rico still without housing since Maria,DÁNICA COTO,7/24/20,"Nearly three years after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, tens of thousands of homes remain badly damaged, many people face a hurricane season under fading blue tarp roofs and the island’s first major program to repair and rebuild houses hasn’t completed a single one. Maria hit more than 786,000 homes on Sept. 20, 2017, causing minor damage to some homes and sweeping others from their foundations. A federally funded program administered by local officials carried out relatively small repairs to some 108,000 homes the next year, while churches and nonprofits patched up thousands with private funds. A Puerto Rican government program known as R3 is the first major effort by the U.S. territory to carry out major repairs and rebuilding of damaged and destroyed housing. Nearly 27,000 homeowners have applied. But nearly 1 1/2 years after federal funding was released to local officials, not a single repair or rebuilding job has been completed. Puerto Rican officials say work is almost finished on the first 45 homes to benefit from the program, but it is not yet complete.  For many Puerto Ricans, the program’s slow progress has become a symbol of their government’s inability to address the long-term effects of the disaster.  “They talk about billions of dollars, but we’re not seeing it,” said Sergio Torres, mayor of the northern mountain town of Corozal. His municipality still has 60 homes with blue tarps as roofs and two families still living in school shelters. ”Ït’s a way of life here.” Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico with 155 mph (249 kph) winds, and its center spent eight hours over the U.S. territory, obliterating the electricity grid and causing more than an estimated $100 billion in damage. An estimated 2,975 people died in the storm’s aftermath. A Puerto Rican government-run program known as Your Home Reborn, which operated from January-December 2018, repaired 108,487 residences with funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Some had to be repaired again due to shoddy work. Churches and nonprofits launched smaller-scale efforts around the island. But tens of thousands of homes in Puerto Rico remain uninhabitable by modern standards, with damage ranging from total destruction to missing roofs. In the central mountain town of Villalba alone, 43 families still live under blue tarps as roofs. Mayor Luis Javier Hernández said one family used theirs for so long that it wore out and he had to give them a new tarp.  R3, which stands for repair, rebuild or relocate, aimed to address the backlog by paying contractors to make repairs for households that earn less than 80% of the region’s median income.  The territory’s government submitted its plans for using federal block grant money for R3 in June 2018. The first $1.5 billion for the program became available in February 2019, with another $1.7 million approved in February this year. Nearly 27,000 households applied for help between R3′s start date, July 31, 2019 through early January, when Puerto Rico’s government stopped taking applications. Of the applications accepted, several hundred have been rejected and thousands remain in the preliminary stages. More than 900 people remain on a wait list. “It’s becoming apparent that Puerto Rico delays are a lot longer than we’ve seen anywhere else,” said Carlos Martín, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. He said Puerto Rico’s housing department is understaffed, and that the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development also has imposed an unusually large number of requirements on Puerto Rico’s government to prevent fraud or misspending.  Puerto Rico’s housing secretary, Luis Carlos Fernández, who took over the position recently, said officials have been trying to simplify the process of verifying and approving requests.  Fernández said he doesn’t know if the federal funds received so far will even be enough to help everyone already accepted into the program. He said elderly applicants, disabled people and those who have significant property damage are first in line.  “We’re not going to be finished for years,” Fernández said. Fernandez said that more than 2,600 of the applicants are still using blue tarps instead of roofs. Former Housing Secretary Fernando Gil said in September 2019 that an overall estimated 20,000 to 25,000 so-called ”blue roofs″ remained across the island. It’s a number that angers Ariadna Godreau, a human rights lawyer who runs a nonprofit legal organization. “We never expected this panorama,” she said. “It’s horrible.”  Among those still waiting is 38-year-old Marián Colón, a single mother of two sons. The hurricane tore off her roof and caused a nearby landslide that put her home in jeopardy, and nothing has been fixed or repaired for nearly three years. During that time, she has bounced from home to home thanks to the generosity of relatives, but she is anxious to settle down. Colón said she knows of several people who applied for the program and gave up after numerous failed tries. She noted some of them don’t have access to the internet or own a car, making the mission nearly impossible. “It’s been a very exhausting and very overwhelming process,” she said.  Gov. Wanda Vázquez, who ascended to that position in August after the previous governor resigned following protests over corruption and other issues, has said she puts a priority on speeding up the reconstruction of hurricane-damaged homes. “The excuses were plentiful, and they were unacceptable,” she said. “Our people have waited too long and can’t take it anymore.”",https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-puerto-rico-latin-america-caribbean-hurricanes-a2cf35e2f8893592ec4b59d90baae1ac,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico to offer virtual classes, delay school reopening",DÁNICA COTO,7/22/20,"Puerto Rico officials announced Wednesday that all public school students will start virtual classes Aug. 17 as the U.S. territory battles an increase in coronavirus cases. Education Secretary Eligio Hernández said he was delaying the reopening of public schools for in-person classes by one month to Sept. 17, though he cautioned it is a preliminary plan that could change if cases aren’t controlled. “The health of our people is always the highest priority,” he said. Puerto Rico is home to one of the largest school districts in a U.S. jurisdiction, with more than 281,500 students enrolled for the upcoming school year. Officials said they expect private schools will follow the same program. Hernández’s announcement raised concerns among some parents, who noted that power outages remain common across the island since Hurricane Maria and that not all teachers or students have access to the internet. Grichelle Toledo, general secretary of Puerto Rico’s Association of Teachers, urged the education secretary to reopen schools for those who don’t have an internet connection. Hernández noted that certain printed materials will be available to pick up at school for those who have internet problems. Hernández also announced that trailers and temporary rental facilities will replace schools in the island’s southern region that have been shuttered since early January as a result of a series of strong earthquakes. In addition, he said parents will have to pick up free daily meals at school. The island of 3.2 million people has reported at least 185 deaths, along with more than 4,300 confirmed coronavirus cases. Health experts said the percentage of positive cases since late June has increased tenfold, prompting the governor to recently announce major rollbacks in reopenings.",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-general-news-latin-america-caribbean-fc1b2ee895c4c453b042b8a62a3dcb16,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to ban alcohol sales on Sundays amid pandemic,DÁNICA COTO,7/20/20,"Alcohol sales will be banned across Puerto Rico on Sundays and nearly all businesses will remain closed that day to help control a rise in cases in the U.S. territory, the governor announced Monday. The changes are the newest measures implemented by Gov. Wanda Vázquez as Puerto Rico sees a spike in COVID-19 cases that forced rollbacks in recent days as more tourists visit the island. “Things have gotten out of control on weekends,” she said. “Many people are forgetting that we still face an emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic.” On Monday, the island of 3.2 million people reported at least 180 deaths, along with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and more than 8,400 probable ones. Starting July 26, all businesses except pharmacies, grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants will have to close on Sundays. Vázquez noted that churches are allowed to remain open. She said she might announce more closures next week. Vázquez last week announced major rollbacks including the closures of bars, gyms, marinas, theaters and casinos and restricted the use of beaches only to those doing exercise. Miguel Vega, former president of the island’s Association of Hotels, said he is requesting a reconsideration regarding the closures of pools and casinos. The closures have deepened a decade-long economic crisis and come as Puerto Rico still struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria and a series of strong earthquakes that hit the island’s southern region earlier this year.",https://apnews.com/7321741baba85c3fa5033c76a869ba60,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico governor, others face formal corruption probe",DÁNICA COTO,7/20/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor and other top officials on Monday became the formal targets of an in-depth government investigation into recent corruption allegations. The U.S. territory’s Special Independent Prosecutor’s Panel agreed to probe the allegations against Gov. Wanda Vázquez and others following a referral from the island’s Department of Justice that ended with two justice secretaries stepping down earlier this month and led to calls for impeachment against the governor. “This is very serious,” Edgardo Román, president of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. “It means there are already two entities that have independently concluded there is sufficient basis to investigate a governor.” The decision marks the first time the special panel investigates a sitting governor in recent history, he said. The panel also will investigate four other government officials including one senator and Chief of Staff Antonio Luis Pabón. A spokeswoman for the governor told the AP that Vázquez already expressed herself on the issue earlier this month during a press conference in which she said she would welcome an investigation and called the allegations “vengeful” and “rigged.” A spokesperson for the chief of staff could not immediately be reached for comment. Former Justice Secretary Dennise Longo had issued a statement in early July saying the governor and others were the targets of an investigation that the department had launched earlier this year involving the alleged mismanagement of supplies slated for Puerto Ricans affected by a series of strong earthquakes. Longo was fired the same day she referred the cases to the special panel. The president of that panel told the AP that someone from the Department of Justice was about to drop off files related to the cases slated for investigation but abruptly left after receiving a call from someone at the Department of Justice. Wandymar Burgos, the justice secretary appointed after Longo was fired, later said she’s the one who demanded the cases be returned because she had just found out about them and needed to research them. Several top members of the governor’s party then demanded she resign, which she did. Vázquez has since denied that Longo was fired in retribution for the probe. She said she asked Longo to quit because of purported interference in an unrelated federal probe into possible Medicaid fraud. Meanwhile, the governor defended Burgos, saying her actions were unusual but not illegal. The special panel now has 90 days to investigate the allegations. Independent prosecutors can decide whether to dismiss them or determine there is enough evidence to file charges. The decision to investigate comes nearly three weeks before Vázquez competes in the Aug. 9 primary of the pro-statehood Progressive New Party to be its candidate for governor in the island’s general elections in November.",https://apnews.com/d0d2dc38fb8a737b8117fc50258b84bf,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico rolls back openings amid spike in COVID-19 cases,DÁNICA COTO,7/16/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Thursday announced major rollbacks including the closure of bars, gyms, marinas, theaters and casinos and restricted the use of beaches as the U.S. territory is hit by a spike in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said the changes and an ongoing curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. will remain in place until July 31. “We’ve reached a level where we need to take more restrictive measures,” she said. Other changes include the prohibition of alcohol sales after 7 p.m., limiting the capacity of restaurants to 50%, and barring tourists from traveling to the popular nearby islands of Vieques and Culebra. Only those who are exercising will be allowed on beaches, including joggers, swimmers and surfers. Vázquez said that $100 million will be released to help municipalities affected by the pandemic and another $150 million to aid private hospitals. She also announced that she has asked the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily suspend flights from Texas and Florida, noting they’re struggling with their own spike in COVID-19 cases. The rollbacks are expected to deepen the island’s economic crisis and lead to a drop in tourism as more visitors flocked to the U.S. territory in recent weeks, angering some who note they don’t always use face masks or take other precautionary measures, like a portion of those who live in Puerto Rico or visit family members on the island. As of Wednesday, all visitors are required to wear a mask and must take a molecular test 72 hours prior to their arrival and submit the results to officials at the airport. Those who refuse to do so, or tested positive, or do not have the test results available, will be forced into a two-week quarantine. Many have criticized the governor, saying she waited too long to make the announcement, which comes roughly a month after she reopened beaches, churches and gyms despite warnings from a government task force created to advise her on such issues. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, more than 7,450 probable ones and at least 172 deaths, including that of a 13-year-old child. Since the end of June alone, the percentage of positive cases in Puerto Rico increased 10-fold, according to Dr. José Rodríguez Orengo, executive director of The Puerto Rico Public Health Trust. “If we don’t take the necessary measures, this is going to keep going up,” he said in a phone interview. The actions of Puerto Rico’s governor mirrors those that many officials are taking in some U.S. states and around the world in an effort to contain a resurgence of the coronavirus. More than 13 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed globally, with more than 580,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are thought to be far higher in part because of limited testing. In recent days, mayors in cities and towns across Puerto Rico took their own action ahead of the governor’s announcement, concerned about the spike. Some, like the popular tourist town of Rincón, closed beaches while others limited restaurants to take out and delivery, and launched their own contact tracing efforts, noting that the central government is not properly keeping track of cases. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz took it one step further Wednesday. She banned anyone who is not a resident, worker or tourist staying in a hotel or Airbnb from entering the historic part of the capital known as Old San Juan from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. In addition, she announced fines for anyone not wearing a face mask in public places. Meanwhile, the town of Añasco made it mandatory for anyone living in that municipality to register any friends or family who visit from outside the island. Also, the northern town of Vega Baja went as far as canceling all recreational and sporting events for the rest of the year, including a popular downhill skateboarding competition. Daniel Colón-Ramos, co-founder of CienciaPR, a nonprofit group of Puerto Rican scientists, praised the mayors for their actions. “This is the type of mentality that we need,” he said by phone. “It’s evidence-based.” He noted that while Puerto Rico’s government has updated its coronavirus data, improved its contact tracing efforts and is now reporting an average of up to 4,000 molecular tests performed a day, more is needed. “What we’re seeing in the data is not good,” he said. “There’s been an exponential increase. That is worrisome.”",https://apnews.com/bd17a761945be5900d7c78d79c74369b,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico questions Spain’s legacy as statues tumble in US,DÁNICA COTO,7/11/20,"Statues, street names, plazas and even the body of conquistador Juan Ponce de León himself: Spain left a nearly indelible legacy in Puerto Rico that attracts hordes of tourists every year, but some activists are trying to erase it as they join a U.S. movement to eradicate symbols of oppression.  Dozens of activists marched through the historic part of Puerto Rico’s capital on Saturday, some wearing traditional Taino clothing as they banged on drums and blew on conch shells to demand that the U.S. territory’s government start by removing statues including those of explorer Christopher Columbus.  “These statues represent all that history of violence, of invasion, of looting, of theft, of murder,” said an activist who goes by the name of Pluma and is a member of Puerto Rico’s Council for the Defense of Indigenous Rights. “These are crimes against humanity.” Columbus landed in Puerto Rico in 1493 accompanied by Spaniard Ponce de León, who later became the island’s first governor and quelled an uprising by the native Tainos, a subgroup of the Arawak Indians. Historians and anthropologists believe that up to 60,000 Tainos lived in Puerto Rico at the time, but they were soon forced into labor and succumbed to infectious disease outbreaks. Centuries later, local government officials honored both explorers by erecting statues and naming streets and plazas after them across Puerto Rico. The Columbus Plaza is located at the entrance of Old San Juan and bears a statue of Columbus unveiled in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of his arrival. Meanwhile, a nearby statue of Ponce de León stands facing south with his left hand on his hip and right finger pointed toward the first settlement he founded. The ruins still mark the spot of the island’s first Spanish capital and is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The statue made of melted steel from British cannons also points in the same direction of the nearby San Juan Bautista Cathedral that bears Ponce de León’s remains and is a popular tourist spot. Activists on Saturday demanded that both statues be removed as the first step in taking down symbols of oppression across Puerto Rico. “No, it won’t be easy,” acknowledged activist Francisco Jordán García, who helped organize the march. “It’s going to be a long process.” But he quickly offered alternatives: “We can melt them and create a different statue of someone who truly deserves it.” Activists recently contacted the office of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and said an assistant told them officials would evaluate the cost of taking down the statues. A Cruz spokesman did not return a message for comment. The march comes as Puerto Ricans’ interest in the territory’s indigenous past continues to grow. In the 2010 Census, some 42,000 of the 3.7 million people living on the island at that time identified themselves as at least partially Taino. Statues of Columbus have been removed or toppled elsewhere in the U.S. mainland following an uproar over racism after the police killing of George Floyd. Protesters in Baltimore threw a Columbus statue into a harbor, while they beheaded another one in Boston. Meanwhile, officials in states including New York, Ohio, California, Missouri and Connecticut have removed similar statues. However, one colossal statue of Columbus remains upright and rooted in U.S. soil. The creation, titled “Birth of a New World,” rises defiantly along Puerto Rico’s north coast, a 660-ton statue that is more than twice the size of the Statue of Liberty without its pedestal. It was once homeless for two decades as several U.S. cities refused to accept it for reasons ranging from cost to appearance until Puerto Rico’s government accepted it as a gift in 1998 and used $2.4 million in public funds to bring it to the island.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-columbus-racial-injustice-21139ea13a1957ce4ea6d0db5679b786,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico braces for political upheaval involving governor,DÁNICA COTO,7/7/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor denied allegations of obstruction of justice late Monday as the main opposition party demanded she be investigated and hinted at a possible impeachment process in what could be the latest round of political upheaval for the U.S. territory. In a brief statement, Gov. Wanda Vázquez for the first time acknowledged an alleged investigation that the island’s Department of Justice is supposedly conducting against her, saying she was never told about it. She also denied recently firing the former justice secretary in alleged retribution for leading the investigation. The details of the alleged investigation were not immediately clear. Vázquez declined further comment, saying only that she would speak further on the issue on Tuesday. “I will share all details up front as I’ve done my whole career. With the truth,” she said. Vázquez’s statement comes after she announced late Friday that she had accepted the resignation of former justice secretary Dennise Longo. No further details were given at the time. The governor released the statement hours after an incident at the Puerto Rico Office of the Special Independent Prosecutor’s Panel. Nydia Cotto, a former judge who serves as the panel’s presdient, told The Associated Press that someone from the Department of Justice was about to drop off files on Monday related to six cases slated for investigation but abruptly left after receiving a call from an unidentified person at the Department of Justice. “That has never happened before,” she said. Cotto declined to identify the people named in those cases or share any other details, saying they were confidential. Puerto Rico’s newest justice secretary, Wandymar Burgos, said in a statement that she requested the documents on the six cases because she had just found out about them on Monday and needed to know what they were about. “Let it be abundantly clear to all the people of Puerto Rico that all investigations of merit will be carried out to the last consequence, regardless of the person involved,” she said. Before the governor released her statement, the opposition Popular Democratic Party held a press conference in which leaders announced they had requested a legislative investigation into the allegations of obstruction of justice. It was not immediately clear if the leader of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives, who is a member of Vázquez’s party, would grant permission for such an investigation. “The people need to hear from the governor herself,” said Aníbal Torres, president of the main opposition party. Vázque served as Puerto Rico’s justice secretary before the island’s Supreme Court ruled that she should be sworn in as governor after former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló stepped down nearly a year ago following massive protests.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-caribbean-impeachments-puerto-rico-obstruction-of-justice-2b9b8648d6fd1fcfe484008932cd6c97,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico faces political turmoil as governor investigated,DÁNICA COTO,7/7/20,"Puerto Rico faced the possibility of political turmoil Tuesday as the U.S. territory’s governor welcomed an investigation into allegations that she obstructed justice amid calls from the main opposition party for a legislative probe and a possible impeachment process. The obstruction claim was leveled by the opposition Monday over Gov. Wanda Vázquez’s ousting of the island’s justice minister on Friday. The fired official, Dennise Longo, issued a statement Tuesday saying the governor and other officials are targets of an investigation that began earlier this year involving the alleged mismanagement of supplies slated for Puerto Ricans affected by a series of strong earthquakes. Longo, who did not provide any details of the case, said she had referred that matter for investigation the day she was forced out. Vázquez denied Longo was removed in retribution for the probe, saying that she did not know she was being investigated. She said that Longo was asked to quit because of purported interference in an unrelated federal probe into possible Medicaid fraud. The governor said she is ready to face justice if the case involving emergency supplies has merit. “I have nothing to fear,” Vázquez said during a lengthy news conference. Vázquez was Puerto Rico’s justice secretary before the island’s Supreme Court ruled that she should be sworn in as governor after Ricardo Rosselló resigned the post nearly a year ago following huge street protests fueled in part by anger over corruption. Shortly after Vázquez’s news conference ended, messages began circulating on social media calling for a demonstration in front of the governor’s mansion Tuesday evening. On Monday, leaders of the opposition Popular Democratic Party announced that they had requested a legislative investigation into the allegations of obstruction of justice.  “The people need to hear from the governor herself,” said Aníbal Torres, president of the party. He and other opposition legislators said an impeachment process should not be ruled out if necessary. It was not immediately clear if Rep. Johnny Méndez, leader of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives, who is a member of Vázquez’s party, would grant permission for such an investigation. He tweeted Tuesday that he would listen to the governor’s news conference before making any decisions. “Our people demand total and absolute transparency in the public function. Puerto Rico doesn’t deserve less than that,” Méndez wrote. Vázquez is competing in the Aug. 9 primary of the pro-statehood Progressive New Party to be its candidate for governor in the island’s general elections in November. Adding to the questions, a former judge who serves as president of the territory’s Special Independent Prosecutor’s Panel said that someone from the Department of Justice was about to drop off files Monday related to six cases slated for investigation but abruptly left after receiving a call from someone at the Department of Justice. “That has never happened before,” Nydia Cotto told The Associated Press. Cotto declined to identify the people named in those cases or share any other details, saying they were confidential. Puerto Rico’s new justice secretary, Wandymar Burgos, said in a statement that she requested the documents on the six cases be returned because she had just found out about them Monday and needed to know what they were about. Vázquez defended Burgos’ decision. “It might be unusual, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong or illegal,” the governor said. During the news conference, Vázquez ordered the Department of Justice to turn over the documents to the Special Independent Prosecutor’s Panel. Shortly afterward, the panel issued a separate statement ordering justice officials to immediately turn over those files.  Sen. Thomas Rivera Schatz, president of Puerto Rico’s Senate and a top leader of the governor’s party, called Tuesday for Burgos’ resignation and said action might be taken once the investigative panel reviews the files and makes a determination. During the news conference, Vázquez accused Longo of improperly intervening in a federal investigation into alleged Medicaid fraud in Puerto Rico, and noted that Longo’s mother at the time was subsecretary of the island’s Health Department.  Longo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The governor acknowledged she has not ordered an investigation into Longo. She said she only learned the details of the allegations against Longo on Friday thanks to a reporter’s question earlier that day that prompted her to ask for the case file. She said she then decided to ask Longo to resign that day.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-puerto-rico-impeachments-eb371cc685f21e39e7cf26439d553e3e,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to demand COVID-19 test results from passengers,DÁNICA COTO,6/30/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Tuesday announced strict new rules for all passengers flying into Puerto Rico in a bid to curb coronavirus cases as officials blame recent outbreaks on those who flew to the U.S. territory and were infected. Starting July 15, all passengers have to wear a mask and must take a molecular test 72 hours prior to their arrival and submit the results to officials at the airport. Those who refuse to do so, or tested positive, or do not have the test results available, will be forced into a two-week quarantine. During that time, they have to undergo a molecular test and share the results if they want to be released from quarantine, said Puerto Rico Health Secretary Lorenzo González. “If you don’t want to be tested, stay home. Don’t come here and complicate our situation,” he said. Most molecular tests involve a nose or throat swab and are used to diagnose an active infection. Puerto Rico’s government will not accept any other test, including antibody ones that require a finger stick or blood drawn. The island of 3.2 million people is emerging from a lockdown that began in mid-March. The government has reported at least 153 deaths, along with more than 1,690 confirmed cases and more than 5,770 probable ones. González acknowledged that the government will not track every single violator ordered into quarantine. Instead, the monitoring via a system known as “Sara Alert” will be random and target those who do not respond to tracking efforts, including phone calls and personal visits. Passengers who do not respond to text messages requesting health updates will be fined. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said her administration will recruit 350 people to help with tracking and monitoring efforts. “We cannot let our guard down, especially with people who live elsewhere and are infected,” she said. The new rules come amid an alarming resurgence of cases in the U.S. mainland, with states like Texas, Florida and California backtracking on reopenings. Meanwhile, worldwide, officials report 500,000 confirmed deaths and 10 million confirmed cases.  Several weeks ago, Vázquez asked the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily ban commercial flights from cities in the U.S. mainland that are considered coronavirus hotspots. The FAA did not respond to that request. Puerto Rico expects to receive up to 9,000 passengers a day in upcoming months, compared with the roughly 4,500 daily current arrivals, said Carla Campos, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Tourism Company.  Vázquez’s administration will require that all passengers fill a form prior to arriving in Puerto Rico with required information including where the test was taken. Vázquez also stressed that everyone has to wear a mask if they’re outside or going into a business. Puerto Rico’s main international airport will continue to be the only one accepting all commercial flights, with no date yet on when other airports, including a smaller international one in the island’s northwest region, will reopen. Currently, passengers can voluntarily undergo a test at the Luis Muñoz Marín airport. More than 280,000 people have been tested, with more than 660 positive results, said Gen. José Burgos, commissioner of the island’s Emergency Management Bureau.",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-health-caribbean-latin-america-863e66c41e5a5ded60b2e8beac2f485f,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico extends coronavirus curfew, reopens more places",DÁNICA COTO,6/29/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor has extended a coronavirus curfew for three more weeks, marking the longest such curfew in any U.S. jurisdiction even as she authorized the re-openings of certain businesses and government agencies. Everyone except essential workers has to stay indoors from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. until July 22. In addition, face masks remain mandatory, and those who disobey will be fined. The initial curfew began in mid-March, and Gov. Wanda Vázquez warned Sunday that stricter measures could return if she sees a spike in cases, with several small outbreaks already reported in some towns that health officials blame on those visiting or returning from the U.S. mainland. “Our priority is to keep our island healthy,” Vázquez said.  The island of 3.2 million people has reported at least 153 COVID-19 deaths, along with more than 1,630 confirmed cases and more than 5,600 probable cases.  Health experts criticized the latest round of reopenings, saying it was premature, especially given a lag in government statistics that don’t reflect the impact of major reopenings announced nearly a month ago, including beaches, movie theaters and gyms. “We could be entering a critical phase in this pandemic,” Puerto Rican epidemiologist Roberta Lugo said. “They shouldn’t have rushed into these decisions.” Lugo and others also note that the government has done too little testing, and most of it using the wrong sort of tests to truly know the extent of the pandemic in Puerto Rico. Adding to the concern is a worsening drought that led the government to announce strict water rationing measures on Monday in which nearly 140,000 clients will not have water for 24 hours every other day starting July 2. Vázquez said government agencies will reopen to the public starting July 6, and certain public employees are expected to return to work on July 1. In addition, people can now resume nearly all sports, with professional sporting events restarting July 15 except those that require physical contact, such as boxing. Casinos were allowed to reopen, but at 75% capacity, and restaurants and businesses can now operate at that capacity as well, up from 50%. Concert venues and cemeteries also are reopening, but with social distancing measures in place. In addition, natural reserves, state forests and wildlife refuges are re-opening to the public on July 1. Vázquez also asked that public and private schools start preparing their reopening plans and coronavirus protocols for August.",https://apnews.com/df4107f46517ea0b13d832a6744f2221,AP,Neutral
Worsening drought forces state of emergency in Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,6/29/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Monday declared a state of emergency as a worsening drought creeps across the U.S. territory amid a coronavirus pandemic. Starting July 2, nearly 140,000 clients, including some in the capital of San Juan, will be without water for 24 hours every other day as part of strict rationing measures. Puerto Rico’s utilities company urged people to not excessively stockpile water because it would worsen the situation, and officials asked that everyone use masks and maintain social distancing if they seek water from one of 23 water trucks set up across the island. “We’re asking people to please use moderation,” said Doriel Pagán, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Water and Sewer Authority, adding that she could not say how long the rationing measures will last. Fernanda Ramos, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service in San Juan, said ongoing dry conditions will be interrupted by thunderstorms forecast to affect the island on Wednesday and Thursday. “However, we are not expecting enough rain... to solve the problem we’re seeing,” she said. More than 26% of the island is experiencing a severe drought and another 60% is under a moderate drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Water rationing measures affecting more than 16,000 clients were imposed earlier this month in some communities in the island’s northeast region. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said 21 of 78 municipalities are affected by the severe drought while another 29 by the moderate drought. An additional 12 municipalities face abnormally dry conditions. The worst of the drought is concentrated in Puerto Rico’s southern region, which continues to be affected by aftershocks following a 6.0-magnitude earthquake that hit in early January and caused millions of dollars in damage. An administrative order signed Monday prohibits certain activities in most municipalities including watering gardens during daylight hours, filling pools and using a hose or non-recycled water to wash cars. Those caught face fines ranging from $250 for residents to $2,500 for industries for a first violation. Vázquez’s announcement comes amid criticism of her administration for not dredging reservoirs, which would eliminate sediment and avoid excess loss of water. Pagán said the utilities company has been in conversation with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency since Hurricane Maria about a $300 million dredging investment. She blamed the lengthy process on the number of studies and analysis needed and that require FEMA’s approval. The upcoming water rationing measures will affect clients who are connected to the Carraízo reservoir, one of 11 that Puerto Rico’s government operates. Pagán said that reservoir was last dredged in the late 1990s. Five other reservoirs are under a state of observation. Officials have already taken other measures, including activating water wells and transferring more than 30,000 clients from Carraízo to another reservoir. The utilities company is restructuring a portion of its multibillion-dollar debt and had suspended all capital improvement projects, including dredging, as a result of its fiscal woes. Natalie Jaresko, executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances amid a deep economic crisis, said Monday that up to 60% of water is wasted, lost or stolen. An upcoming project to install meters at the company’s production facilities is expected to improve the situation, and the board has approved a fiscal plan for the utilities company that calls for dredging projects. However, the company has final say on whether it will carry out those projects and what kind of funding it would use. Puerto Rico last experienced a punishing drought five years ago that affected 2.5 million people and led to severe water rationing measures. During that time, some 400,000 utility customers received water only every third day.",https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-puerto-rico-droughts-weather-caribbean-485aa49fc349decdbbef5e663d92dc74,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico hit with water rationing amid severe drought,No Author,6/19/20,"Puerto Rico’s government announced water rationing measures on Friday as 26% of the U.S. territory faces a severe drought amid the pandemic. 
 The island’s utilities company said water will be shut off for eight hours a day starting Saturday in several neighborhoods in the northern municipalities of Canovanas and Loiza.  
 “We don’t know how long this is going to last,” said Roberto Martínez, the company’s director for the metropolitan region as he urged everyone to be prudent in their water use. 
 Another 57% of the island is experiencing a moderate drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
 Water trucks will be available during the rationing, Martínez said. 
 Other parts of the Caribbean are experiencing similar problems, with short-term severe drought reported in certain areas of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Meanwhile, officials in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe have extended water rationing measures that began in April until late July.",https://apnews.com/c7fec884e19eee4265e3fe401e89fdb2,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico gov unveils budget critics say is unrealistic,DÁNICA COTO,6/19/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Thursday promised wage increases for teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public workers, unveiling a government budget higher than the one submitted by a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances. It is the first budget submitted by Gov. Wanda Vázquez since the island’s Supreme Court authorized her to lead the U.S. territory last August after former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló stepped down amid huge protests. The budget contains an additional $169 million in spending compared with the board’s $10 billion plan. Before beginning the annual budget address, Vázquez asked for a minute of silence for those who have died of COVID-19. The island has reported more than 1,490 confirmed coronarivus cases, with at least 147 deaths. Her speech contained multiple promises of incentives and spending increases that critics said were moot, given the island’s economic crisis and the control board’s power over Puerto Rico. Vázquez vowed to fight corruption as the U.S. territory awaits millions of dollars in federal funds while struggling to recover from hurricanes Irma and Maria, a string of recent strong earthquakes and the pandemic. Altogether, those events have caused losses estimated at billions of dollars amid a more than decade-long recession and a bankruptcy-like process to restructure a portion of the island’s more than $70 billion in public debt. “Rest assured that regardless of where it comes from and no matter the cost, I will not waver in the fight against corruption,” she said. Vázquez announced a $314 million increase in the health budget, a $176 million increase in the education budget and a $285 million increase in the public safety budget. She did not specify where the additional funds would come from. She also promised to scrap an increase in the enrollment fee at Puerto Rico’s biggest public university and award the school an additional $55 million to offset pandemic losses. She said the government would distribute computers to all public school students and teachers by July and give $1,000 to any public and private school student enrolled in a post-secondary institution so they can buy technological equipment. Other promises include subsidies of up to $150 per farmer, the construction of 300 to 400 housing units a month to help those affected by hurricanes and earthquakes and $350 million to help subsidize home purchases, with priority given to such workers as police, nurses and firefighters. In addition, Vázquez rejected government pension cuts sought by the control board and promised to keep a traditional Christmas bonus awarded to all public employees. Critics expressed surprise at the numerous pledges, saying the address felt more like a political campaign. They noted Vázquez is running for governor this year and will face Pedro Pierluisi, a seasoned politician, in an Aug. 9 primary of the New Progressive Party. Puerto Rico Sen. Eduardo Bhatia, a member of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party who is also running for governor, accused Vázquez of not addressing many of the problems facing the island, including the tens of thousands of people still seeking unemployment assistance following a two-month coronavirus lockdown and awaiting new housing following the hurricanes and earthquakes. Thomas Rivera Schatz, president of Puerto Rico’s Senate and a member of the governor’s party, defended her budget and said legislators will start debating all proposals Friday. The budget has to be approved by July 1.",https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-puerto-rico-2019-2020-coronavirus-pandemic-b0a3042f3dfe4e2743eb11f40cd4330e,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico to reopen beaches, gyms after 3-month lockdown",DÁNICA COTO,6/11/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Thursday that she will lift nearly all restrictions aimed at curbing coronavirus cases, which means beaches, churches and businesses including movie theaters and gyms across the U.S. territory will reopen after three months. 
 Gov. Wanda Vázquez said the changes will occur starting June 16, when businesses also will be allowed to operate seven days a week and restaurants at 50% capacity. However, she tweaked an ongoing curfew that will remain in place for two weeks from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  
 She also said Puerto Rico will be officially ready to welcome tourists starting July 15 and that airport screenings will continue. 
 “These have been hard decisions,” she said. “Now it’s up to each one of us...to decide where to go and how to go about it.” 
 The announcement worried some experts who say the island of 3.2 million people has done too little testing, and most of it using the wrong sort of tests to truly know the extent of the pandemic. The government has reported more than 1,400 confirmed cases and nearly 4,000 probable cases, with at least 144 deaths. 
 Masks will still be required while outside the home and inside any business. 
 The changes were cheered by many in the business community, noting that the lockdown lifted by phases in recent weeks has had an overall estimated $5 billion to $10 billion impact on the island’s economy. 
 Vázquez’s announcement comes a day after the island’s health officials said Puerto Rico saw its peak of COVID-19 cases and related deaths two months ago, a claim that experts also questioned, noting it’s based on the limited number of tests available at the time. 
 Health Department Secretary Lorenzo González said he was confident in the agency’s statistics but warned people to maintain social distancing as the island reopens.  
 “It definitely comes with risk,” he said. 
 Vázquez warned that the restrictions would return if the number of cases, deaths or hospitalizations spike. In addition, public transportation including buses and trains will not operate yet. 
 “I want people to understand we’re still in a pandemic,” she said.",https://apnews.com/cbb235d1adf237f206761b48815837f5,AP,Neutral
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Puerto Rico financial oversight board appointments,Lawrence Hurley,6/1/20,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld appointments to Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board that had been challenged by creditors in a ruling that avoids disruption to the panel’s restructuring of about $120 billion of the bankrupt U.S. territory’s debt. The justices, in a 90 decision authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, concluded that the 2016 appointment of seven board members did not violate the U.S. Constitution’s socalled appointments clause as the challengers had argued. The outcome hinged on the court’s conclusion that the board has control primarily over local issues, meaning the appointments were valid under the Constitution’s language regarding naming officials to certain government posts. The board appealed after the Bostonbased 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that the appointments were unlawful because the members had not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The legal challenge was brought in 2017 by Puerto Rico creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rico bonds, and Unión de Trabajadores de la Industria Eléctrica y Riego, Inc, a labor group that represents workers at Puerto Rico’s governmentowned electricity utility. Bondholders face losses as a result of debt restructuring while the labor group has said the board’s proposed restructuring of the utility’s debt would lead to its members having worse working conditions. Congress created the board in 2016 to address the Caribbean island territory’s fiscal crisis. The board, which has paused the restructuring of debt during the coronavirus pandemic, welcomed the ruling, saying in a statement it is “steadily working towards instituting longterm fiscal planning and balanced budgeting. ”The board already faces another legal battle. Last week, bond insurer Ambac Financial Group Inc filed a lawsuit claiming that provisions in the 2016 law that allowed for the island’s 2017 bankruptcy filing are unconstitutional.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-court-puertorico-idUSKBN2382TY,Reuters,Neutral
Board suspends budget cuts for struggling Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,5/27/20,"A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances approved a revised fiscal plan on Wednesday that temporarily suspends all budget cuts and anticipates the island’s projected surplus could plunge by 65% as it warned the government is unable to pay current debt obligations. The plan will serve as a blueprint for a U.S. territory crippled by hurricanes, earthquakes and the coronavirus pandemic as it continues to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt load. Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director, said the island’s economy will shrink over the next five years and that the anticipated surplus in upcoming years will drop from $23 billion to $8 billion from fiscal years 2020 to 2032. The projected surplus would come from the government implementing measures outlined in the fiscal plan, which does not include debt payments in estimated figures. She declined to say how this drop would affect the repayment of Puerto Rico’s debt, saying only that the island cannot afford existing contractual obligations and that the board will meet with mediators and creditors to talk about the next steps. “The shock of the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico is severe,” she said, noting that the revised economic projections are similar to those issued after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. The board rejected a different version of the fiscal plan filed by Puerto Rico officials, saying it eliminated certain cuts, offered different macroeconomic projections and did not contain strong enough measures to make the government more efficient, among other things. Board chairman José Carrión said that the suspension of budget cuts for one year will allow the government to improve how it operates and implement reforms needed in the labor sector and other areas. “This plan is a wake-up call for this government,” he said. “For decades, the people of Puerto Rico have been waiting for real transformation.” Omar Marrero, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, said it’s unclear when the reforms sought by the board could be implemented because of the ongoing economic uncertainty. In addition, Marrero, who is also the government’s representative to the board, raised concerns about pending debt obligations. “The debt repayment solution cannot rest solely on austerity,” he said. “It would offer no hope for Puerto Rico.” The modified fiscal plan comes less than a week after Rep. Raúl Grijalva submitted amendments to a law that created the board as part of a financial package for Puerto Rico.  The bill calls for an audit of Puerto Rico’s debt and declares public health, education, safety and pensions as essential public services, which could protect them from funding cuts. In addition, the bill would guarantee funding for the University of Puerto Rico and allow the local government to shed certain debt. The bill was submitted amid criticism that the board is not protecting Puerto Ricans and has not done enough to improve the island’s situation. “The crushing fiscal austerity imposed by the original ... law has failed to improve economic development or fix chronic poverty in Puerto Rico, so it’s time for a more people-focused approach,” Grijalva said in a statement late last week. Hurricanes Irma and Maria, coupled with recent strong earthquakes, have caused billions of dollars in damage amid an extended economic crisis. Then the pandemic hit, with experts warning the island of 3.2 million people with a more than 40% poverty rate — higher than any U.S. state — could also see a 40% unemployment rate. Some economists estimate that the COVID-19 crisis will cause economic losses ranging from $6 billion to $12 billion. Echoing some of the priorities outlined in the federal bill, Jaresko said the board wants to see an improvement in government services and called for things including implementing a back-to-school plan, developing a telehealth system and moving police officers from administrative positions to the field. “We need to work twice as hard because the people of Puerto Rico have twice the need right now,” she said during a meeting Tuesday with reporters. Shortly after Jaresko spoke, New York-based Ambac Financial Group, a large insurer of Puerto Rico debt, announced that it filed a lawsuit against the board, alleging the law that created it and allowed the island to restructure its debt is unconstitutional and unenforceable. The board said in a statement to The Associated Press that it is reviewing the lawsuit and will respond in upcoming weeks.",https://apnews.com/c8bf0f494bb8a06319a5315cf76663b4,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico to reopen businesses, beaches with new rules",DÁNICA COTO,5/22/20,"Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, hair salons and retail stores next week under strict new rules as the U.S. territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island already beset with economic woes. Gov. Wanda Vázquez announced Thursday that most businesses will reopen on Tuesday, but a 7 p.m-to-5 a.m. curfew will remain in place until June 15. All people will be required to wear a mask when outside or inside a business, regardless of what they are doing. “Puerto Rico is facing a new way of life,” she said. “It’s the right time ... We have flattened the curve.” Many Puerto Ricans, including business owners, cheered the highly anticipated announcement.  Health experts, however, warned that the government has not tested enough people or conducted enough contact tracing and is not prepared for a possible spike in new infections. In addition, most of the re-openings contradict recommendations made by a government-appointed medical task force. Puerto Rico’s Health Department has reported more than 2,900 confirmed COVID-19 cases and at least 126 deaths, and dozens of additional infections still emerge every day. Officials do not regularly update statistics, including how many people have been tested or how many have recovered. Until recently, the island had a lower per-capita testing rate than any U.S. state. Mónica Feliú-Mójer, spokeswoman for CienciaPR, a nonprofit group of Puerto Rican scientists who seek widespread testing, said she was concerned that the government’s data did not show that COVID-19 is under control. Vázquez said the restricted reopenings will protect people but also provide desperately needed economic relief on an island hit by hurricanes and earthquakes. The resumption of some normal activities also comes as the government restructures some of its more than $70 billion public debt load after declaring the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2015. Restaurants will be allowed to operate at 25% capacity. Hair salons and barber shops will welcome clients by appointment only. People doing exercise, such as surfing, jogging, swimming or kayaking, will be allowed at the beach from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Retail stores will be allowed to reopen but under limited capacity, and people will be prohibited from trying on clothes, among other restrictions. Malls will open June 8. “You will not be allowed to stroll the halls like before,” the governor said. “There will be lanes ... We have to be disciplined.” Businesses that will remain closed for now include gyms and movie theaters, and all arriving flights are limited to Puerto Rico’s main international airport. Economist José Caraballo said that the lockdown, one of the strictest in any U.S. jurisdiction, has caused estimated economic losses ranging from $6 billion to $12 billion. The unemployment rate has spiked to an estimated 40% on an island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40%, higher than any U.S. state. Unlike in the aftermath of hurricanes Maria and Irma and a recent string of earthquakes, Puerto Ricans cannot move to the U.S. mainland because of the pandemic, Caraballo said in a phone interview. “They are desperate,” he said. “The usual escape valve, which was migration, is closed.” Delays in the distribution of local and federal aid have also deepened the financial struggles of many Puerto Ricans affected by the natural disasters and the government’s ongoing bankruptcy-like process, which has led to austerity measures. “The government’s inefficiency has caused the social crisis we have right now,” Caraballo said. Public schoolchildren and those seeking pandemic unemployment assistance have been especially hurt by the pandemic. The government kept school cafeterias shut for almost two months, opting to offload its food to nonprofits and a local food bank, where it quickly ran out. That forced some teachers to buy food for their students with their own money. In addition, some 90,000 people applied for pandemic unemployment assistance when the funds became available on April 28, but an online system crashed. It was not until Thursday that the government said that the first 50,000 people began receiving payments. It’s unclear when the remaining applicants will receive the money. Some business owners did not feel like celebrating much. Hair stylist Anabel Fuentes said she lost up to $8,000 during the lockdown, and worries she will continue to lose money because she can only attend a limited number of clients now. “The financial problems will persist, and might even worsen and lead to bankruptcy,” she said. “Nothing will be the same.”",https://apnews.com/e8571cf25893af43f03fe6380d2d9e78,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to hold statehood referendum amid disillusion,DÁNICA COTO,5/16/20,"Gov. Wanda Vázquez announced on Saturday that she will hold a nonbinding referendum in November to decide whether Puerto Rico should become a U.S. state, a move that comes amid growing disillusion with the island’s U.S. territorial status. For the first time in the island’s history, the referendum will ask a single, simple question: Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted as a U.S. state? It’s an answer that requires approval from U.S. Congress and a question that outraged the island’s small group of independence supporters and members of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo. But it’s a gamble that members of the governor’s pro-statehood party are confident will pay off given that Puerto Rico has struggled to obtain federal funds for hurricanes Irma and Maria, a string of recent strong earthquakes and the coronavirus pandemic amid growing complaints that the island does not receive fair and equal treatment. “Everything important in life carries some risk,” said former Puerto Rico governor Carlos Romero Barceló, a member of the Progressive New Party. Previous referendums have presented voters with more than one question or various options, including independence or upholding the current territorial status, but none have been so direct as the one scheduled to be held during the Nov. 3 general elections.  “Our people will have the opportunity once and for all to define our future,” Vázquez said. “It’s never too late to be treated as equals.” Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. And while the island is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes and receives less federal funding than U.S. states. Many believe the island’s territorial status has contributed to its struggle to recover from the hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as worsened its economic crisis, largely caused by decades of heavy borrowing and the elimination of federal tax incentives.  U.S. Congress would have to accept the referendum results for it to move forward, and it has never acted on the island’s previous five referendums. The last one, held in 2017, was hit by a boycott and a low turnout that raised questions about the vote’s legitimacy. More than half a million people favored statehood in that referendum, followed by nearly 7,800 votes for free association/independence and more than 6,800 votes for the current territorial status. Voter turnout was just 23 percent. In the three referendums prior to 2017, no clear majority emerged, with voters sometimes almost evenly divided between statehood and the status quo. Statehood would award Puerto Rico two senators and five representatives, but it’s unlikely a Republican-controlled Congress would acknowledge the referendum because Puerto Rico tends to favor Democrats. Roberto Prats, a former Puerto Rico senator and member of the Popular Democratic Party, said in a phone interview that the upcoming referendum will be an exercise in futility like the five previous ones. “The only thing they’ve done is take away credibility from the statehood movement,” he said, adding that Puerto Rico has eroded the federal government’s trust with its decades of corruption and mismanagement, and that any referendum should first have support from U.S. Congress. “If we’re going to make a decision regarding our relationship with the U.S., the U.S. has to be involved in that discussion.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-us-news-latin-america-cdf24e971c469dcea977cbb1ccded453,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico approves new civil code, sparking fears over LGBT+ rights",Oscar Lopez,5/15/20,"Lawmakers in Puerto Rico this week approved a new set of civil laws that enshrine rights for LGBT+ people, even as opponents say gaps in the code could fuel discrimination toward trans people in the U.S. territory. The updated civil code, which covers noncriminal legal issues like marriage and property, passed the island’s House of Representatives on Thursday after clearing the Senate on Monday and will now head to the desk of Governor Wanda Vazquez. “The current civil code of Puerto Rico is from 1930 ,it’s totally and completely obsolete,” said Rep. Jose Melendez with the ruling New Progressive Party, adding that the outdated code did not reflect key decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court. The old Puerto Rican laws contained antiLBGT+ rights language, he told the Thomson  Foundation. “What is being done is updating,” he said. Among the changes are updates on marriage, which is described as a contract between “two people” rather than a man and a woman, reflecting the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage. But legal experts and opposition lawmakers said ambiguous and contradictory wording in the code could create legal hurdles for trans people. “On its face it seems as if there’s nothing wrong, but if you scratch the surface, there’s an obvious intent to discriminate,” said Rafael Cox Alomar, a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia. Among the contradictions in the code, critics say, is language about the ability of trans people to change their gender on birth certificates, legal in Puerto Rico since 2018. The updated code states that nothing “undermines the process currently established” for legally changing a person’s gender, but amendments to a person’s birth sex on original birth certificates “cannot be authorized”. That leaves trans people in legal limbo, rights activists say, and could even result in greater stigma or discrimination for an already vulnerable group. “If on the one hand you’re prohibiting it and on the other you are allowing it, it’s clearly unconstitutional,” said Pedro Julio Serrano, an LGBT+ campaigner. Under the new code, instead of changing gender on original birth certificates, an annotation would note their gender identity. “It lends itself to stigmatization and huge discrimination,” said Luis Vega, a congressman with the opposition Popular Democratic Party. “That certificate would have a kind of mark or stain that distinguishes you from everyone else in Puerto Rico. ”In a statement posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Governor Vazquez said the civil code approved by the Senate included adequate amendments “to guarantee the permanence of rights already achieved. ”Vazquez now has ten days to approve or veto the bill. Puerto Rico has seen a recent surge of violence against the LGBT+ community, with 10 gay and trans people murdered in less than a year and a half.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-lgbt-trfn-idUSKBN22R3EH,Reuters,Neutral
Damage reported as 5.4-magnitude quake strikes Puerto Rico,DÁNICA COTO,5/2/20,"A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck near southern Puerto Rico on Saturday, briefly knocking out power and forcing the relocation of at least 50 families on an island where some people still remain in shelters from previous quakes earlier this year. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a depth of 5.6 miles (nine kilometers) near the city of Ponce and the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla, where hundreds of homes were destroyed by a quake in early January that killed one person and caused millions of dollars in damage. The earthquake cracked walls, flung goods off supermarket shelves and caused a second-story balcony to crash in the southern coastal city of Ponce. It occurred amid a two-month lockdown and just hours after the government announced the biggest spike in COVID-19 cases since the first one was reported in March in the U.S. territory. “This is a crisis on top of another crisis,” said Health Secretary Lorenzo González. Most of the damage was reported in Ponce, where officials were still going neighborhood by neighborhood to assess damage as rescue crews fanned out across the region. “It’s time to cry if you have to cry,” said Ponce Mayor María Meléndez. “We’re human beings.” Gov. Wanda Vázquez said the 50 families that have to relocated will not be placed in shelters given concerns about the coronavirus contagion. She also urged Puerto Ricans to stay home even if they want to drive to the island’s southern region to help those affected and distribute food as they did earlier this year following the 6.4-magnitude earthquake. “We’re up against an emergency situation, but we can’t forget that the most lethal one we have in our hands is COVID-19,” she said as she urged people to wear masks and other protective equipment even if they have to evacuate damaged buildings. “If we forget these, the result is going to be worse.” Meanwhile, in Guánica, Mayor Santos Seda told The Associated Press that no major damage has been reported so far, but noted that between five to 10 people remain in a shelter since the 6.4-magnitude quake that hit in January. “Thank God everyone is OK,” he said. “The infrastructure is already weak.” Several aftershocks hit Puerto Rico’s southern region, including a 4.9-magnitude one. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, said in a phone interview that while it’s understandable many people are afraid and surprised by the most recent earthquake, it’s not unusual given the seismic activity that began in the region in late December. “In the long run, it’s decreasing, but you can have peaks,” he said, adding that he expects strong aftershocks to continue. Nerves are already frayed in many parts of the island as Puerto Rico continues to recover from Hurricane Maria, a string of strong earthquakes and the coronavirus. Silvestre Alicea, a 67-year-old man who moved back to Puerto Rico from New York upon retiring, lost his home in January’s earthquake and is still living with his sister in Guanica.  “This is unreal,” he said, adding that some neighbors have left the area to stay with relatives elsewhere and that many, including a security guard who worked all night, are now sitting nervously in their balconies. “He hasn’t slept.” Alicea, however, said he decided to knock down a couple of breadfruits from a nearby tree as the aftershocks continue: “I’m taking it easy. There’s nothing else you can do.”",https://apnews.com/18f0c26413bc5b65e1ae04e690f7d3b3,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to partially reopen despite coronavirus concerns,DANICA COTO,5/1/20,"Puerto Rico is taking its first tentative steps in relaxing a nearly two-month lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic, while health experts warn that the U.S. territory is relying on faulty statistics and has not yet seen its peak of cases. Gov. Wanda Vázquez announced Thursday night that starting Monday, certain sectors including finance and real estate will reopen. On May 11, construction and manufacturing are allowed to restart. Other businesses also allowed to soon reopen on weekdays will include laundromats, moving services and those that repair elevators and air conditioning units. In mid to late March, the retail trade, barbershops and beauty salons will be allowed to operate. All businesses are ordered to provide protective equipment to their workers, and anyone entering a business has to wear a face mask. The lockdown for everyone else was extended until May 25, with some exceptions. People will be allowed outside to run, bike and walk their dogs from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Parks, gyms and beaches remain closed, and everyone except essential workers are ordered to stay inside from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.  “We cannot forget that we’re facing a real emergency,” Vázquez said. “If there’s no need to leave your house, don’t.” Puerto Rico has reported at least 92 deaths and more than 1,500 confirmed cases. However, the government is no longer sharing key statistics, including how many people have been tested. As of last week, Puerto Rico had the lowest per capita testing rate compared with any U.S. state, with some 12,000 people tested on an island of 3.2 million. It’s an issue that worries Mónica Feliú-Mójer, spokeswoman for CienciaPR, a nonprofit group of Puerto Rican scientists who seek widespread testing. “We don’t know where we stand with the infections and the pandemic,” she said in a phone interview. “Every day, we have less access to data.” One of her biggest concerns is how the government would be able to determine if there is widespread contagion following the partial reopening of businesses. She noted that Vázquez’s televised address came on the same day that more than 100 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were announced, one of the highest numbers since the lockdown was implemented in mid-March. Others have concerns over the economic damage that the extended lockdown will have on an island still recovering from Hurricane Maria and a series of recent earthquakes amid a long recession. Economist José Caraballo said in a phone interview that the lockdown has had a $5 billion to $10 billion impact on the island’s economy. He also worries about a growing number of small businesses that have permanently closed.  “There’s been no mention about implementing measures to counteract the negative impact of the lockdown’s extension,” he said. While Puerto Rico’s government has started distributing incentives to certain workers, tens of thousands are still awaiting unemployment benefits and food assistance. And islanders have yet to receive the $1,200 federal incentive. Among those cautiously cheering the governor’s announcement amid the financial squeeze was Jesús Vázquez, who is now authorized to open his laundromat. “You feel good that you’re finally getting some income,” he said. “We will take all security measures needed, but you’re still afraid regardless.”",https://apnews.com/9547b121e33610539879a968044d6dd1,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico officials face outrage over school food crisis,DÁNICA COTO,4/30/20,"Puerto Rico’s government has failed to tap into millions of federal dollars set aside for the island as a growing number of unemployed parents struggle to feed their children in a U.S. territory where nearly 70% of public school students are poor. The roughly $290 million that the U.S. government made available to help Puerto Rico schoolchildren amid a coronavirus lockdown has remained untouched for more than a month because local officials have not submitted a plan detailing how they intend to use the funds. “It makes you say, ‘Damn it, where is the help?’” said Joalice Santiago, a fourth grade teacher who buys food for her students and, like many of her co-workers, goes house by house to distribute it. In a move expected to ease the food crisis caused by the shuttering of school cafeterias in mid-March, Puerto Rico’s governor announced late Wednesday that cafeteria workers would prepare meals, but only if requested by mayors of the island’s 78 municipalities. City workers would then be in charge of distributing the food to children in need. The announcement came amid growing outrage over the situation and a day after Education Secretary Eligio Hernández insisted that he would not reopen school cafeterias that have been closed for nearly two months. He said it was too risky to open them because 64% of workers are elderly and he worried about exposing them and children to the coronavirus. It’s a dilemma that school districts on the U.S. mainland have faced, with some shuttered cafeterias reopening to distribute food on a takeaway basis.  The abrupt turnaround comes weeks after Puerto Rico’s Department of Education offloaded food to nonprofit organizations and a food bank to distribute to children. Activists, teachers and a federally appointed control board had warned that it was not enough and that it was not reaching those most in need. Teachers like Santiago vowed to keep helping impoverished families as many remained wary about the government’s announcement and its ability to meet children’s needs. On a recent sweltering morning, she popped open her trunk and grabbed a loaf of white bread as she approached Delia Vicente, an unemployed mother of two boys whose husband is hospitalized with a bacterial infection and unable to work as a debris collector. Vicente smiled as she saw Santiago and another teacher carrying a heavy bag filled with eggs, crackers, cheese, milk, ham and orange juice, items she can’t afford to buy right now. “I pretend to be strong, but I can’t,” Vicente said as she wiped away tears and turned away from her oldest son, who was watching. “I try not to let them see me cry.” The U.S. territory of 3.2 million people has a poverty rate of more than 40% that is deepening with a nearly two-month lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus, as the island struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria and a string of strong earthquakes amid a 13-year recession. It is the highest poverty rate compared with any U.S. state, and Vicente and her family fall into that group. She said teachers are the only ones who have donated food for her two boys, ages 9 and 11, despite the government saying schoolchildren are being fed. Hernandez’s department has distributed more than 350,000 pounds of food from 704 schools to nonprofit organizations and a food bank. That food has already run out, and another nearly 180,000 pounds will soon be distributed.  Hernández declined to comment on a lawsuit that seven mothers and a group of nonprofits filed on Tuesday against him and the school system, saying the government’s actions are “inhumane, cruel, inadequate, insufficient and evasive of their responsibility.” The lawsuit states that the 350,000 pounds of distributed food represents only a little more than a pound per student to cover their needs during more than 40 days of lockdown. Normally, Puerto Rico’s 292,000 public school children receive breakfast, lunch and a snack. “I have children who are in the middle of a crisis because those meals were their only ones for the day,” said social worker Michelle Valentín. “Families are saying they’re not getting any donations when they call the food bank.” A federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances had demanded that education officials create a food distribution plan and criticized them for donating raw food to nonprofits. “This represents only fourteen days of food, while schools have been closed for over a month,” the board wrote in a letter to Gov. Wanda Vázquez. “Furthermore, this food is being made available to all community members; while commendable to provide food for all, this program is designed for students and their families.” The board also joined teachers and social workers in suggesting that Puerto Rico follow the lead of major U.S. cities, which are delivering the food or offering meals to go. But even some school districts in the U.S. mainland have cut back on meals as money runs out or workers become infected with COVID-19. It’s a concern that Nelly Ayala, president of a Puerto Rico school cafeteria workers’ union, has raised, adding that they never demanded cafeterias be closed, only that employees be protected. “We have always been here in any emergency, but this time there’s a serious personal safety issue that needs to be taken into account,” she said in a statement. Puerto Rico’s Department of Education said it is launching a federally funded program this summer so that nonprofits can offer up to two free meals a day to children up to age 18, but many worry thousands of families cannot wait that long. Critics also worry about how quickly school cafeteria workers will be able to resume their jobs following Wednesday’s announcement, and whether all mayors will request meals. Especially hard-hit are single mothers like Jenny Encarnación, an unemployed nail technician who struggles to feed her son, a 4th grade student. As Encarnación explained how she hasn’t received any help from the government, a female passer-by who overhead the conversation interjected, “No one has!” and kept walking. “My savings have taken a nosedive,” Encarnación continued. “I have no income.”",https://apnews.com/8aa80f80a56d550e686b985fc46ed1f4,AP,Neutral
Wave of trans murders sparks fear of 'hunting season' in Puerto Rico,Oscar Lopez,4/29/20,"Puerto Rico has been hit by an “epidemic of violence” with five transgender murders in two months, LGBT+ activists said on Wednesday, adding that homophobic rhetoric from politicians and religious leaders may have fuelled the bloodshed. Opposition lawmakers and campaigners called on the government to publicly acknowledge and investigate the violence, after the bodies of two trans women were found inside a charred car last week and another trans woman was killed in February. “Trans people are living in fear, they are terrified,” said Pedro Julio Serrano, spokesman for the Broad Committee for the Search for Equality, an LGBT+ rights advocacy group. “It’s as if they’ve opened hunting season against the LGBT+ community, and they’re hunting us, they’re looking for us and they are killing us,” he told the Thomson  Foundation. The Puerto Rican Governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Police commissioner Henry Escalera Rivera said that he had met with representatives of the LGBT+ community “to work together for a better Puerto Rico”. “We have general orders and procedures that guide officers on how to intervene with members of the (LGBT+) community,” he said. “As always, we have our doors open to dialogue and discuss any proposal for the benefit of Puerto Rico. ”While many other Caribbean islands outlaw gay sex, the U.S. territory has introduced legal reforms, legalising samesex marriage in 2015 and allowing trans people to change their gender on birth certificates in 2018. But the predominantly Roman Catholic island has a history of violence and intolerance towards gay and trans people, with 10 LGBT+ people killed in less than 18 months in the latest crime wave, rights groups say. HATE SPEECHSerrano said antiLGBT rhetoric from local politicians, religious leaders and the former head of state had contributed to the violence. Governor Ricardo Rossello resigned in 2019 after hundreds of pages of group chat messages were leaked, including homophobic comments about gay pop singer Ricky Martin, who is Puerto Rican. “That hate speech is pervading the minds of people in Puerto Rico and there is this resurgence of violence against LGBT+ people,” he said, adding that the failure to prosecute hate crimes made matters worse. “If you have a government that does not investigate, that does not care that (LGBT+) people are being murdered . . . you are certainly sending a message as a society that these people are worth nothing. ”February’s killing of trans woman Alexa Negron Luciano made global headlines after a video circulated online, apparently showing her being shot dead while men laughed. Ramon Luis Nieves, a former senator who is running for office again this year, said Puerto Ricans’ attitudes towards gay and trans people needed to change.""While discrimination may have been eradicated from the law books . . . we still have a ways to go to eradicate discrimination and hatred from the minds and hearts of many,"" he said.

Missteps mar Puerto Rico’s response to the coronavirus,DÁNICA COTO,4/15/20,"Puerto Rico officials say data that show COVID-19 cases on the island are much lower than in some U.S. states constitute proof they are containing the new coronavirus, but a series of missteps is raising concerns it could be more widespread than believed. The U.S. territory is bracing for an anticipated peak of cases in early May as federal authorities probe a $38 million contract for testing kits that experts say are urgently needed but never arrived. Local officials, meanwhile, have favored televised discussions over press conferences in a situation that has angered many and drawn comparisons to Hurricane Maria. “We’re basically operating blindly,” said Mónica Feliú-Mójer, spokeswoman for CienciaPR, a nonprofit group of Puerto Rican scientists who are demanding widespread testing. Puerto Rico announced its first COVID-19 cases in mid-March, including one involving an elderly Italian tourist. Since then, officials have reported at least 51 deaths and more than 970 confirmed cases, with more than 1,400 test results pending. Some 9,200 people overall have been tested on an island of 3.2 million inhabitants, representing less than 1% of the population. Experts say the number is way below those of U.S. states with similar populations that the local government has used for comparison to say they have the coronavirus under control. Utah, for example, with a population of 3.2 million, has reported 18 deaths and more than 2,300 confirmed cases, but it has tested more than 45,700 people. Epidemiologist Fabiola Cruz said Puerto Rico has conducted 2,800 tests per million people, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at least 6,000 tests per million to make accurate projections. Overall, the U.S. national average is 596 tests per 100,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico reports 288 tests per 100,000, the lowest compared with any U.S. state. On Wednesday, dozens of Puerto Ricans got into their cars and honked their horns as they joined a street protest to denounce alleged corruption and demand more testing amid a lockdown imposed March 15 and extended until May 3. Health experts and economists say one of their biggest concerns is that Puerto Rico officials are using the limited data to estimate the peak of cases and implement a lockdown that has crippled a frail economy amid a 13-year recession as the island struggles to recover from Maria and a series of strong earthquakes.  Economist Jose Caraballo estimates the current unemployment rate at 37%, and said widespread testing is needed to stop the pandemic and eventually reopen businesses. The island’s Department of Labor has said it is receiving 10,000 unemployment claims a day. Experts also worry the island’s anemic health sector can’t properly prepare if officials don’t know how many cases they’re truly facing. “We have an uninformed strategy,” said Feliú-Mójer, noting that the island’s governor recently claimed her administration is controlling the curve of contagion. “Puerto Rico really does not have sufficient data to make that kind of assertion.” However, Puerto Rico hospitals have more than 800 ventilators and roughly half of total ICU beds available and have not reported a spike in patients. On Monday, Health Secretary Lorenzo González announced that officials would be distributing 200,000 rapid testing kits, acknowledging that the government needs at least 21,000 test results for a solid model. That is more than double what the government has reported. “We are fighting to obtain testing kits,” said González, who became the island’s health secretary two weeks ago and noted that Puerto Rico is competing with dozens of countries amid the pandemic. Meanwhile, newly appointed state epidemiologist David Capó said testing is currently reserved only for those who show symptoms and need it the most. While the call for widespread testing grows stronger, federal and local authorities and Puerto Rico legislators are investigating a $38 million government contract to buy one million testing kits that was recently canceled amid intense scrutiny. The contract was made with Apex General Contractors, a small Puerto Rico construction company that said it would source the kits from Promedical, a manufacturing company in Australia. Promedical issued a statement to The Associated Press saying it had not been in conversation or entered into a contract with Apex, adding that it sells rapid test kits to approved distributors for less than half the value identified by Apex. While Puerto Rico’s government recuperated its deposit, critics say it lost important time to secure testing kits elsewhere. “This is something we have to keep investigating,” Rep. Juan Oscar Morales, a member of the governor’s party, told reporters on Tuesday. While Puerto Rico has been praised for implementing a lockdown in mid-March that officials say has helped curbed the number of coronavirus cases, the government didn’t start contact tracing until nearly three weeks after the first case was reported, and it still has not publicized the location of hundreds of positive cases. A coalition of mayors awaiting that information said it would go to court to obtain that data, although González said Wednesday the details would soon be shared once mayors sign documents acknowledging certain information is private. The health department also is trying to regain its footing after seeing three health secretaries in the span of two weeks last month, with the first secretary resigning after the governor criticized how he handled the coronavirus crisis. Fearful that Puerto Rico’s government is not doing enough, the mayors of some towns are taking their own protective measures. Luis Javier Hernández, mayor of the central mountain town of Villalba, decided to close the town’s borders and initiate its own contact tracing with the help of Cruz, the epidemiologist. They have been the ones informing the health department about cases, instead of the other way around, with Hernández accusing the central government of leaving towns to fend for themselves and of keeping them in the dark regarding COVID-19 statistics. “Ever since Hurricane Maria, we learned we cannot wait on anyone,” he said. “I thought the government would have learned from that situation.”",https://apnews.com/e5ba6c2639ee52dad5e367d2228ac764,AP,Neutral
"Judge voids Puerto Rico pension law, delays effective date due to coronavirus",Reuters Staff,4/15/20,"A U.S. judge ruled on Wednesday that bankrupt Puerto Rico cannot fund more than $300 million in annual pension and health costs for its municipalities, but suspended the effective date of the order for three weeks due to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin Baez/File PhotoPuerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board sued the U.S. commonwealth’s governor and fiscal agency in July, contending a new law authorizing the funding does not comply with its fiscal plan and violates the 2016 federal PROMESA Act, which established the board and a restructuring process for Puerto Rico’s $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, voided Law 29, a measure enacted last May to aid the Caribbean island’s cashstrapped municipalities by eliminating their obligation to pay for employee health and pension costs. The order, however, will not take effect until May 6 due to “the additional challenges facing the parties during the COVID19 public health crisis,” according to Swain’s ruling. “We are examining the court ruling together with our lawyers in order to decide on a legal strategy,” Puerto Rico’s fiscal agency said in a statement. “In addition, we will resume good faith negotiations with the oversight board in order to reach an agreement. ”It added, “Our goal has always been to find a fair and fiscally responsible solution that allows municipalities to continue operating and providing basic services to the people. ”The head of Puerto Rico’s Federation of Mayors told local newspaper El Nuevo Dia that with the economy halted by the virus, the decision was devastating for cities. The board estimated that Puerto Rico’s government would spend about $311 million in fiscal 2020 and an estimated $1. 7 billion over the next five fiscal years to fund local pensions and healthcare ,costs that the fiscal plan allocates to municipalities. The ruling comes as restructuring plans for Puerto Rico’s core government debt and for its electric power authority (PREPA) debt have been put on hold due to the coronavirus. The island has 932 reported cases of the virus, the most of any U.S. territory, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN21X3E4,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico extends lockdown to May to fight COVID-19,DANICA COTO,4/12/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Saturday that the U.S. territory will remain on lockdown until May 3 to curb coronavirus cases, marking one of the strictest measures taken in a U.S jurisdiction. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said non-essential businesses will remain closed and that people have to remain indoors from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., leaving outside those hours only to buy food or medicine or go to the bank. However, she lifted all license plate restrictions and said hardware stores and car repair shops can operate twice a week on limited schedules. Everyone is still required to wear a face mask to enter any business as Health Secretary Lorenzo González warned that the peak of cases is not expected until early May. “We cannot lower our guard,” he said. “We have not seen the worst of it.” Puerto Rico has reported more than 780 confirmed cases and at least 42 deaths, including that of a pediatrician and of a couple of people in their early 40s with no prior health conditions. More than 1,300 test results are pending, and nearly 900 police officers have been placed in isolation after being exposed to COVID-19. Meanwhile, critics say the government does not have an accurate picture of how many COVID-19 cases exist in Puerto Rico since there has been no widespread testing. Some 7,700 people have been tested on an island of 3.2 million people. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  The lockdown was first implemented on March 15, and the extension announced Saturday is raising concerns about its impact on an island struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria and from a string of recent strong earthquakes amid a 13-year recession. The costs associated with the coronavirus crisis and the economic fallout could cost Puerto Rico an estimated $4 billion, said Omar Marrero, executive director of the island’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority. That amount represents nearly half of the government’s overall budget. Meanwhile, the island’s Treasury Department has estimated that it could lose up to $1.6 billion in revenue. Last month, the governor approved a record $787 million package to alleviate the curfew’s financial hit, including a 90-day moratorium for mortgages as well as car, personal and commercial loans and bonuses ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 for certain workers including nurses and police officers. Since then, Puerto Rico’s Department of Labor has said it has processed more than 131,000 unemployment claims, sometimes receiving more than 10,000 claims a day. In addition, more than 45,000 business owners have sought a $1,500 one-time payment from the local government. Aside from the curfew, the government is taking other steps to contain the number of coronavirus cases. The National Guard has screened more than 55,000 passengers at the island’s main international airport, and nearly 200 have been placed in isolation. Authorities have accused some visitors of taking medicine to hide their fevers, leading the governor to request this week that the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily suspend all flights from coronavirus hotspots in the U.S. mainland, including flights from New York, Florida and New Jersey. The FAA has not responded.",https://apnews.com/082ab059f77b925a535688e876f474e8,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico shifts virus death count rules, seeks flight ban",DANICA COTO,4/8/20,"Puerto Rico announced Wednesday that it will broaden its classification of COVID-19 deaths to include suspected cases that were never confirmed —addressing a problem of undercounting also seen around the world. The U.S. territory has faced heavy criticism for not implementing widespread testing and for relying on limited data to implement a strict curfew and to produce estimates of when the peak of coronavirus cases might occur. Health Secretary Lorenzo González said doctors can classify a death as related to COVID-19 without having to wait for lab results. “This way, we maintain uniformity with U.S. states ... which will provide us with a more clear picture of how we compare with the U.S. mainland,” he said in a statement. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate without that confirmation if “circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.”  Spokesman Eric Perlloni told The Associated Press that previous deaths would be reviewed, but he did not provide details including how far back officials would go or who would be in charge of reviewing those cases. Authorities in several countries have acknowledged that deaths from COVID-19 have been undercounted for lack of testing, a problem that has been noted especially in deaths at nursing homes in Europe. The issue is also sensitive in Puerto Rico, where officials eventually acknowledged that an estimated 2,975 people had died as a result of Hurricane Maria in 2017, vastly more than the low hundreds that were initially reported. Puerto Rico’s government also has not shared data about how many patients have recovered, how many are in intensive care or how many health professionals have tested positive. Overall, Puerto Rico has reported at least 24 deaths and more than 600 confirmed cases, with only 6,000 people tested in a U.S. territory of 3.2 million. The announcement was made hours after Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez said she asked federal officials to ban all flights from U.S. cities with a high number of coronavirus cases to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 on the island. The petition to the Federal Aviation Administration was made after authorities accused some visitors of taking medicine to lower their fevers to avoid being placed in quarantine by National Guard troops screening people at Puerto Rico’s main international airport.  At least two passengers from New York who lowered their fever with medication are now hospitalized in the island with COVID-19, said National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Dahlen. “They themselves admitted it,” he said, adding that the two people called health authorities when their condition worsened and that one of them was placed on a ventilator. Vázquez asked to ban flights from New York, Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Illinois. Joel Pizá, interim executive director of Puerto Rico’s Ports Authority, said in a statement that those flights would be rescheduled when there’s a drop in cases in those states. It’s unclear how many flights would be affected if the FAA agrees to the temporary ban. A Ports Authority spokesman did not return a message for comment. The FAA previously authorized a petition from the U.S. territory to allow the National Guard to screen passengers at Puerto Rico’s main international airport and agreed to reroute all commercial flights to that airport. The National Guard has screened more than 52,000 people with the help of high-speed infrared cameras that set off an alarm if they detect a high temperature. More than 160 passengers were ordered to remain isolated for two weeks, although the government has no way of ensuring that they follow those instructions. Puerto Ricans have been increasingly complaining about a high number of COVID-19 cases among tourists arriving from the U.S. who don’t adhere to the required two-week quarantine. One man was heavily criticized on Twitter after he posted that he was at the supermarket just days after arriving in Puerto Rico from New York. The territory’s government imposed a curfew on March 15 that has shuttered all non-essential businesses and ordered people to stay in their home unless they have to buy food, medication or go to the bank. Hundreds have been cited for violating the curfew.",https://apnews.com/f5f1310a7b4af83630e551e5bb66f439,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico imposes stricter COVID-19 measures amid lawsuit,DANICA COTO,4/6/20,"The ACLU said Sunday it is seeking an injunction to block part of Puerto Rico’s strict curfew against the new coronavirus, arguing that some of its restrictions are unconstitutional as the governor imposed even tighter measures, including requiring anyone entering a business to wear a face mask. The curfew imposed March 15 has shuttered non-essential businesses in the U.S. territory and ordered people to stay home from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and remain there even outside those hours unless they have to buy food or medicine, go to the bank or have an emergency or health-related situation. Violators face a $5,000 or a six-month jail term, and police have cited hundreds of people. “There’s been no martial law declared, and there are no circumstances for it,” the ACLU argued. “As such, emergency states cannot be used to suspend fundamental rights.” Gov. Wanda Vázquez said she had not yet read the entire lawsuit but stressed she would take any and all measures to protect Puerto Ricans. It is the first time the ACLU has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. jurisdiction related to a coronavirus curfew. In a statement last month, the ACLU said it will keep monitoring the use of emergency powers during the COVID-19 pandemic. “History teaches that our government is most prone to committing abuses in times of crisis, and we must ensure that broad presidential powers are not misused beyond legitimate needs,” it said. Puerto Rico has reported 20 deaths and more than 470 confirmed cases, and many expect the island’s curfew to be extended.  On Sunday night, Vázquez announced stricter regulations for Holy Week as she and other government officials wore face masks during a news conference.  She said nearly all businesses including supermarkets and banks must close on the three days from Good Friday through Easter Sunday, with only pharmacies and gas stations allowed to operate. She said people will be allowed outside during that period only if they are seeking medical help or an essential service.  In addition, Vázquez ordered that until further notice, businesses prohibit entry to anyone not wearing some kind of face mask. She said scarves wrapped around the face would be acceptable. Officials did not say whether the curfew now scheduled to end April 12 might be extended. “The worse is yet to come for Puerto Rico,” said Health Secretary Lorenzo González, who warned that the peak of cases is expected between mid-April and early May. The government’s executive order already bars people who aren’t part of a “family nucleus” from getting together for meetings, parties or other gatherings. The ACLU suit filed Saturday argues that the state cannot decide who forms part of a family nucleus, nor determine who should be kicked out and fined inside a home. The lawsuit names three Puerto Ricans who say exemptions to the ban are confusing and that they worry about being arrested as they leave their homes daily to care for elderly mothers, including giving insulin injections. While the order allows people to leave their homes for emergencies or health-related situations, the ACLU argues the order is too vague and leaves too many interpretations in the hands of police officers who haven’t been properly briefed. “The (executive) order pretends that constitutional rights be handed over blindly to the government, and that is unacceptable. The government cannot interfere with who you interact with within your home or define your family nucleus,” the lawsuit states. Fermín Arraiza, legal director of Puerto Rico’s ACLU chapter, said in a phone interview that another issue is the creation of new misdemeanors, an action that under the Constitution requires approval from the legislative branch. The ACLU filed the lawsuit in Puerto Rico’s Court of First Instance.",https://apnews.com/86171da74e787acf1a3c613a1c516311,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico acknowledges missteps as coronavirus peak looms,DANICA COTO,4/1/20,"Puerto Rico’s newest health secretary on Wednesday acknowledged a series of mistakes the government has committed as the U.S. territory prepares for a peak in coronavirus cases. Lorenzo González, who is the third health secretary to serve in the span of two weeks, said the missteps include a lack of contact tracing and improper tracking of those who have tested positive. “The process was deficient,” he said. “Nobody along those lines of command did what was prudent.” González also said two hospitals, including one previously designated to receive coronavirus patients, will be investigated and fined for recently refusing to accept a patient presenting symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Puerto Rico has reported 11 deaths and more than 280 confirmed cases. González warned the U.S. territory is still awaiting items including ventilators and protective equipment, noting that it’s competing with the U.S. mainland: “There is no guarantee any of that equipment will arrive.” The lack of protective equipment has become a significant concern for law enforcement officials across the island. Puerto Rico on Wednesday closed its fifth police station in a week, raising concerns about the U.S. territory’s ability to respond to the coronavirus pandemic as officers accused the government of exposing one of the largest police departments in a U.S. jurisdiction to COVID-19. More than 150 officers are under quarantine amid a month long curfew that has shuttered beaches, parks and non-essential businesses. “It’s not fair that the government is dragging its feet. What do they want? To be left without police officers?” said Gregorio Matias, vice president of a local police union who demanded more protective equipment. The first police station to close is located in the popular tourist town of Rincon, where the 42-year-old wife of one officer recently died from COVID-19. Also shuttered are police stations in Aguas Buenas, Caimito, Moca and San German. Matias said the union requested protective equipment two months ago but has barely received any items. “We are cannon fodder,” he said. Police Commissioner Henry Escalera told The Associated Press that officers have items including gloves and hand sanitizers, and that his department is awaiting delivery of more items that will allow him to distribute 30 face masks to each officer, along with protective gowns. “There’s a shortage,” he said. “We hope that they will arrive.” Puerto Rico also has closed a 911 call center, a fire station in the island’s capital, a medical emergency response office and a municipal emergency management office. Critics are demanding the government investigate who police officers have been in contact with, including inmates and prosecutors, warning the virus could be more widespread than estimated since police have been stopping hundreds of people violating a curfew that is one of the strictest in any U.S. jurisdiction.",https://apnews.com/314e95867d4bf656cca043397111380d,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico unveils record $787M package to fight COVID-19,DANICA COTO,3/23/20,"Puerto Rico on Monday announced a record $787 million financial package to help alleviate the economic impact of the new coronavirus in the U.S. territory. The package is bigger than any announced so far by U.S. states. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said measures include a 90-day moratorium for mortgages as well as car, personal and commercial loans that will not affect people’s credit. She also announced a flurry of bonuses, including ones ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 for nurses, police and other emergency and medical workers. In addition, the government will invest $250 million in tablets, software and other items to help the island’s Department of Education improve virtual learning amid a two-week curfew that began the night of March 15, she said. Vázquez said the island’s more than 134,000 public sector employees will still be paid during the emergency and that the government will offer a $1,500 handout for small- and medium-sized businesses with 50 employees or less that don’t qualify for federal help, as well as a $500 cash handout for Puerto Rico’s nearly 170,000 self-employed workers. “We’re going to win this war,” she said. The island is struggling through a 13-year recession in addition to the blows from Hurricane Maria and a string of recent strong earthquakes that together caused billions of dollars in losses. Among the business owners affected by the economic crisis and the curfew is Jesús Vázquez, who praised the financial package but said he worries about the fine print and the bureaucracy that might ensue in trying to obtain those benefits. The 33-year-old laundromat owner confided that he has already skipped loan payments: “I had the audacity to not pay them and keep the cash because I don’t know what’s going to happen.” Vázquez was flanked by the chairman and president of a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances that signed off on the measures and freed up money for the emergency. It was a rare appearance following months of conflict between the board and a government that was already balking at austerity moves and staff cuts demanded by the board.  The board recently said it also would file a motion to temporarily suspend a bankruptcy-like process Puerto Rico is facing as it tries to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt load. In addition, the board wrote President Donald Trump last week about plans to transform the island back into the medical manufacturing hub it once was to meet the urgent needs created by the coronavirus pandemic. Board chairman José Carrión noted that 8% of pharmaceutical expenditures by Americans are for products made on the island, where manufacturing represents more than 40% of its total net income. Puerto Rico as of Monday had 31 confirmed coronavirus cases and reported two deaths, including a U.S. tourist from New York who was vacationing on the island with his wife. “This situation is really absurd,” said José Abreu, a musician known as Fofé who lost his job at a boutique hotel in San Juan that closed due to the curfew. “We’re here with our mouths wide open over how we’re being hit with one thing after another.”",https://apnews.com/article/san-juan-latin-america-caribbean-puerto-rico-virus-outbreak-ce93cc56e5db561c00c8fa4a05b29ad2,AP,Neutral

Puerto Rico cracks down on violators of coronavirus curfew,DANICA COTO,3/17/20,"Sirens blared across Puerto Rico’s busiest beaches on Monday as police cleared hundreds of tourists from the U.S. territory’s coast in a crackdown on people violating a newly imposed curfew aimed at curbing the new coronavirus. Using loudspeakers, police in patrol cars ordered people off the beach: “Please stay at home. Governor’s executive orders. The beach is closed.” The sweep surprised many tourists in the capital of San Juan, some of whom disregarded orders to stay inside their hotels on a sunny day. “Why would I get sick at the beach? I’m not going to be touching anything,” said 46-year-old David Zimmer of Richmond, Minnesota, as he joined a group of family and friends flip-flopping their way to a beach that police had driven through just an hour ago to empty it out. Other tourists heeded the warnings and shuffled back to their hotels, many carrying take-out meals before locking themselves in. Puerto Rico Secretary of State Elmer Román said at a press conference on Monday that no one is allowed to go to the beach, clarifying an executive order issued Sunday that has confused many. “Unfortunately, tourists have to stay in their rooms,” he said. Román earlier told local residents, “You will stay in your house unless you are going to buy food or medicine,” he said. “People have to understand this is something serious.” Puerto Rico had recorded only five confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Monday, and no deaths.  The new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, though it can cause more severe illness for older adults and people with existing health problems. The World Health Organization says people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico, said in a phone interview that the mandate comes during one of the busiest times of the year and will have a significant impact on tourism, which makes up nearly 7% of the island’s economy. “We understand that some visitors may be disappointed, but the safety of residents and visitors has to be of utmost priority,” he said.  Elsewhere across Puerto Rico, authorities said Monday they had fined more than two dozen businesses and arrested a bar owner for violating the curfew, and they warned that violators would be pursued more aggressively in upcoming days. Officials also announced that the National Guard will start screening passengers arriving at Puerto Rico’s main airport by Wednesday and that the government will hold all meetings and press conferences online only. The situation also led the Federal Emergency Management Agency to announce Monday that it was temporarily suspending operations to help hundreds of Puerto Ricans who lost their home last month during a series of strong earthquakes. The announcement was followed by some good news: Puerto Rico’s government said it would not charge rent at public housing complexes until the curfew is lifted. Meanwhile, certain private sector employees complained their bosses were ordering them to go to work despite the curfew, prompting the government to urge all non-essential workers to stay at home. Román warned that police will issue fines to individuals, not just businesses accused of violating the order. Officers have started 12-hour shifts to ensure people comply with the curfew, with violators facing a six-month jail term or a fine of up to $5,000.  On Sunday, Gov. Wanda Vázquez ordered a two-week closure of nonessential government offices and commercial businesses except for gas stations and those in the food, health and finance sectors. Puerto Rico also cancelled major events, including an Ironman race scheduled for this past weekend.  Tizgel High, a 41-year-old athlete from Nashville, Tennessee who was supposed to compete in the Ironman competition, resigned herself on Monday to run around a track near the beach. She had received an alert via her cellphone on Sunday that people were banned from being outside from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but she had not heard that they could not be outside during the day. “Not being on the beach doesn’t make much sense to me,” she said.",https://apnews.com/2d57b506106f131418c7c846d20babc1,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico orders curfew, business closures for coronavirus",No Author,3/16/20,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Sunday ordered a curfew and the closure of all businesses and nonessential government offices, except for gas stations and those dealing in food, health or finance. The closures ordered by territorial Gov. Wanda Vázquez started at 6 p.m. and last for two weeks. The order affects shops, theaters, parks, malls, gyms, courts and other activities. It follows confirmation of a fifth confirmed case of the new coronavirus in Puerto Rico.  Takeout restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies and banks can remain open. But they’ll have to close each day at 6 p.m. Even citizens will be barred from the streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m., save for those working in security, health or food distribution. Elizabeth Solá Oliver, owner of a yoga and pilates studio in San Juan, began looking at ways to continue operating over the next two weeks. But she said it will be difficult because her clients must follow the isolation order.  “We are evaluating the possibility of streaming, putting classes online and yes, we are available to give private yoga and pilates classes,” she said. “But the studio has 10 teachers. The majority are dedicated to this full time and if all the studios close and the gyms too, it is going to be a very difficult situation.”  Jorge Argüelles, president of the United Retail Central, an organization that brings together about 5,000 small and medium businesses, called the order ambiguous and said there were merchants with doubts about its scope. “The government must take advantage and implement measures that reduce the cost of doing business in Puerto Rico and that compensate the affected businesses,” Argüelles said. The governor’s order sets a six-month jail term or a fine of up to $5,000 for violators. It came a day after the governor ordered schools closed until March 30. Solá Oliver said she had found the order confusing as well, but that its effect will “in economic terms be devastating.”",https://apnews.com/0709f80ce89f9c004aa3c9eddf3166f4,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico announces its first confirmed coronavirus cases,No Author,3/14/20,"Tests have confirmed three cases of the new coronavirus in Puerto Rico, the first for the U.S. territory, Gov. Wanda Vazquez said Friday night. She also announced that the public school system would close for 14 days and that no cruise ships or the ferry from the Dominican Republic would be allowed to dock. Vazquez said one of the cases involved a local man who had relatives who traveled off the island and the other two are tourists from northern Italy, which is at the center of a major outbreak of COVID-19 disease in that nation. Even before the announcement, several events including concerts and a circus performance had been canceled on the island due to worries about the virus, which has spread around the world. The University of Puerto Rico and some private colleges cancelled classes. Officials said the first case was a 68-year-old Italian woman who arrived Sunday on the Costa Luminosa cruise ship and had symptoms consistent with the virus. She was taken to a hospital in San Juan and a test confirmed she is infected with coronavirus. Her 70-year-old husband also was found to be infected. The third confirmed patient is a 71-year-old local man who was test after being hospitalized with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. The vast majority of people infected with the coronavirus recover, and most have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems.",https://apnews.com/15b3086be86fc9d9c258c2576b670671,AP,Neutral
3 employees suspended in $4M Puerto Rico online scam,DÁNICA COTO,2/14/20,"Puerto Rico’s government said Friday that it suspended three employees as federal agents investigate an online scam that attempted to steal more than $4 million from the U.S. territory. Manuel Laboy, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Industrial Development Company, said rigorous procedures were not followed when the agency received an email alleging a change in banking accounts that prompted someone to transfer more than $2.6 million to a fraudulent account in the U.S. mainland last month. “We do not take this lightly, and there are consequences,” he said. Laboy declined to share the names and positions of those suspended, saying only that it was one employee from his agency and two from Puerto Rico’s Commerce and Export Company, which sent $63,000 as part of the scam. He added that the FBI has been able to freeze the money sent, which involves public pension funds. “This situation did not affect and will not affect pension payments to retirees,” he said. The scam also targeted Puerto Rico’s Tourism Company, which sent $1.5 million, police have said. José Ayala, director of the fraud unit with the police department’s bank robbery division, said the scam began when someone hacked into the computer of a finance worker at Puerto Rico’s Employment Retirement System in December and sent emails to government agencies. He said government officials realized what had happened when someone at the retirement agency asked why they had not yet received the funds, only to be told they had already been sent. Ayala said the FBI is investigating how the computer was hacked. José Quiñones, president of Obsidis Consortia, a nonprofit cybersecurity organization in Puerto Rico, said those types of attacks are common and can be prevented to a certain point. “No system is 100% safe,” he said, adding that training employees on cyberattacks and keeping software up to date is key. “This is a well-coordinated attack,” he said. “Where the government failed greatly was in the procedures, not the technology.”",https://apnews.com/4425716dd1db3e82ad9e5c6ab595c852,AP,Neutral
Official: Puerto Rico govt loses $2.6M in phishing scam,DANICA COTO,2/13/20,"Puerto Rico’s government has lost more than $2.6 million after falling for an email phishing scam, according to a senior official. The finance director of the island’s Industrial Development Company, Rubén Rivera, said in a complaint filed to police Wednesday that the agency sent the money to a fraudulent account. Rivera said the government agency transferred the money on Jan. 17 after receiving an email that alleged a change to a banking account tied to remittance payments, according to a police statement. Manuel Laboy, executive director of the agency, told The Associated Press that officials found out about the incident earlier this week and immediately reported it to the FBI.  “This is a very serious situation, extremely serious,” he said. “We want it to be investigated until the last consequences.” Laboy declined to say how officials found out about the scam, whether anyone has been dismissed or how the company’s operations have been affected by the missing funds. He said an internal investigation is under way to determine whether someone was negligent or did not follow standard procedure, adding that government officials are trying to recover the money. “I cannot speculate about how these things might happen,” he said, addressing heavy criticism from Puerto Ricans who were incredulous upon hearing the news.  Laboy added that his agency takes the management of public funds very seriously. “It’s a big responsibility.” Police did not return calls for comment. The situation comes as the U.S. territory remains mired in a 13-year recession that has in part forced the government to cut back on some services.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-us-news-latin-america-e03bea7e491b9c95350887880376562f,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico’s economy in limbo as governor rejects debt deal,DANICA COTO,2/10/20,"Puerto Rico’s fragile economy is facing an uncertain future after the island’s governor rejected a settlement announced late Sunday with bondholders that would reduce the U.S. territory’s public debt by 70%. The settlement is the biggest one to date since the island’s government announced in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and filed for the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in May 2017.  It’s unclear whether the deal will become final, with Gov. Wanda Vázquez saying it places too heavy a burden on the island’s retirees and noting that it still requires legislative approval. The deal also has to be approved by a federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process for Puerto Rico. “If the bondholders receive better treatment in the bankruptcy process, so should retirees,” she said. “This is an issue of basic justice.” She said bondholders received new legal protections in amendments made to a September 2019 adjustment plan, but that retirees did not receive anything additional. It’s the latest clash between Vázquez and a federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances, which reached the deal with several groups of bondholders to reduce the island’s bond debt from some $35 billion to roughly $11 billion.  Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director, said the island’s bankruptcy needs to be resolved. “The new agreement is another step forward for Puerto Rico, one that gets the island much closer to ending bankruptcy and to the beginning of a true economic recovery,” she said in a statement. Board members did not respond to the governor’s rejection of the settlement, and a board spokesman did not return a call for comment. The announcement comes as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in 2017, and a series of strong earthquakes that have damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings along the island’s southern region.  Over the weekend, Puerto Rico government officials including Vázquez accused the board of delaying approval to release funds to help those affected by the quakes, accusations that the board denied in a letter earlier on Sunday before it announced the debt deal.  “Allegations that the...board has over 50 pending requests including for food, water and portable toilets are untrue,” it said. “None of the ten requests received were for portable toilets or water. All requests were processed within hours of receipt.” Many have criticized Vázquez’s administration over its response to the 6.4 earthquake that killed one person on Jan. 7 as heavy aftershocks keep further damaging buildings. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico economist José Caraballo told The Associated Press that he worries the deal could threaten basic government services and leave the island without sufficient funds to respond to the pending needs from the hurricane and earthquakes. “The risk of a second bankruptcy and a prolonged recession is bigger than before,” he said.  Puerto Rico is mired in a 13-year recession, and roughly half a million people have left the island in the past decade, fleeing from the economic crisis and the aftermath of the hurricane and earthquakes.",https://apnews.com/dd85b43cad66dec9026c4dd07df9287f,AP,Neutral
Deal reached to cut bankrupt Puerto Rico's debt by $24 billion,Reuters Staff,2/9/20,"Puerto Rico would shed about $24 billion of debt and move closer to exiting bankruptcy under an agreement with bondholders announced on Sunday by the U.S. commonwealth’s federally created financial oversight board. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin BaezThe deal would cut $35 billion of bonds and claims to about $11 billion as it increases the ranks of general obligation (GO) and Public Buildings Authority (PBA) bondholders that signed onto a plan to restructure core government debt and more than $50 billion in pension obligations that the board filed in U.S. District Court in September. The Caribbean island commenced a form of municipal bankruptcy in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and liabilities. Just months later, residents had to endure devastating hurricanes and more recently the strongest earthquake in more than a century. In a statement, Oversight Board Chairman José Carrión said the deal “lowers total debt payments relative to the agreement we reached last year, pays off commonwealth debt sooner, and has significantly more support from bondholders, further facilitating Puerto Rico’s exit from the bankruptcy that has stretched over three years. ”However, the deal faces opposition from Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez because it does not roll back proposed pension cuts. Under the agreement, bondholders would face average value reductions of 29% for GO bonds and 23% for PBA bonds, which is lower than haircuts of 36% to 65% that were included in the September plan of adjustment. The board had targeted more than $6 billion of GO bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 for low recoveries, contending they were issued in violation of Puerto Rico’s constitutional debt limit. The deal would end the board’s pursuit to void those bonds in court and the risk that holdout bondholders would recover none of their investment if the debt were invalidated. Creditors would receive $10. 7 billion in new debt, split between GO bonds and sales taxbacked junior lien bonds, along with $3. 8 billion in cash, the board said. It also shortens the timeframe to pay off the island’s legacy debt to 20 years from 30 years. Pensions remain an issue for the governor and others as the board has been seeking a maximum 8. 5% cut for retirees who receive more than $1,200 in monthly benefits. “My position during this process has been that if bondholders receive better treatment in a new deal, pensioners must also receive better treatment,” Vazquez said in a statement.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKBN2030UI,Reuters,Neutral
House passes Puerto Rico aid in face of Trump veto threat,No Author,2/7/20,"The Democratic-controlled House on Friday passed a $20 billion-plus aid package for Puerto Rico, where a swarm of earthquakes last month set back the island territory’s slow, troubled recovery from the hurricane devastation of 2017. The legislation, approved by a mostly party-line  237-161 vote, would provide more than $5 billion in emergency appropriations, mostly for housing aid, rebuilding infrastructure, and repairing roads and bridges. It also includes $16 billion worth of tax breaks, mostly designed to extend refundable child tax credits for low-income families and to give the island’s residents equal access to an earned income tax credit for low-income earners. But the White House has promised to veto the legislation, charging the island’s government of mismanagement and weak financial controls. It arrives in the Senate as a dead letter anyway. Puerto Rico’s non-voting congressional delegate, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, a Republican, urged Democrats to look for common ground in hopes of getting agreement on an aid package the White House might accept. The Trump administration has been slow to release $44 billion in money that’s already been approved for Puerto Rico, stoking the ire of Democrats, who mounted a high-profile campaign to try to force the administration to release aid more quickly. A White House veto threat took note of huge balances of unspent aid. “Over the last three years, we have allocated more than $40 billion for Puerto Rico disasters, and less than half of that has been spent,” said Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee. “And we have all seen recent press reports about warehouses in Puerto Rico full of water, diapers and food that have not been distributed to residents in need. ”Democrats, however, see a double standard. Trump has trumpeted aid efforts to disaster-slammed states, especially in coastal southern GOP strongholds. But he has feuded with Democratic elected officials in Puerto Rico and has supported aid to the island after the urging of GOP office holders such as Florida GOP Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio,. “Don’t come here and say that ‘We have been there for Puerto Rico,’” said Rep. Nydia Velasquez, D-N. Y. “This administration has done everything within their power to withhold the money flowing to Puerto Rico. ”The Puerto Rico aide issue is also infused with politics, as the population of Puerto Ricans on the mainland is growing while the island has steadily lost population during a long economic decline made worse by natural disasters. More than 200,000 residents of the U.S. commonwealth have relocated to Florida, New York and elsewhere. Friday’s debate exposed bipartisan frustration with the federal bureaucracy for disaster victims, particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency, over delays in aid to rebuild schools, hospitals, roads, and the island’s heavily damaged electrical grid.",https://apnews.com/ac3f114e02a41580240d1a76818dcc60,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico bonds trade higher in wake of report of tentative deal,Reuters Staff,2/6/20,"Puerto Rico general obligation bonds traded higher on Thursday in the wake of a report of a tentative deal involving debt that the U.S. commonwealth’s federally created financial oversight board has been trying to void. More than $6 billion of bonds Puerto Rico issued in 2012 and 2014 had been targeted by the board for allegedly being issued in violation of a debt limit in the Caribbean island’s constitution. As a result, owners of those bonds were assigned low recoveries in a debt restructuring plan the board submitted in September to a U.S. District Court hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy case. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that competing groups of bondholders and the board reached an initial compromise that would settle a dispute over the 2012 and 2014 bonds. AdvertisementA tentative deal would increase recoveries for the bonds and remove the need to litigate their validity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Representatives for the board and for various bondholders declined to comment. Bonds issued in 2014 that had been trading at 69 cents on the dollar in late January sold at 72. 63 cents on Thursday. Other bonds issued in 2012 with a 2041 maturity traded at 76 cents, up from the 72cent range last week, according to Municipal Market Data (MMD). Daniel Berger, MMD’s senior market strategist, said the perception that bondholders would get higher recoveries was driving prices higher. Puerto Rico commenced a form of municipal bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. The board’s socalled plan of adjustment for the government’s core debt offered recoveries of 45% for the 2012 bonds and 35% for the 2014 bonds with holdout bondholders facing the risk of receiving nothing if the bonds were ultimately invalidated in federal court. The recovery for nondisputed GO bonds issued before 2012 was pegged at 64%. At a federal court hearing last week, the board’s attorney hinted that movement in mediation with creditors could be announced this month.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-idUKL1N2A526N,Reuters,Neutral
Bondholders lose appeal over claim on Puerto Rico pension system assets,Reuters Staff,1/30/20,"A U.S. Appeals Court on Thursday ruled that bondholders’ claim on the assets of Puerto Rico’s public employee pension system ended when the system filed for bankruptcy in May 2017. The Bostonbased First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Federal Judge Laura Taylor Swain’s June decision that bondholders’ claim on employer contributions to the U.S. commonwealth’s Employees Retirement System (ERS) did not extend into bankruptcy. The ruling is a further setback for owners of nearly $3 billion of the system’s bonds after a federal appellate court determined last year they had a legally enforceable claim as of December 2015 on assets pledged by the pension fund to pay off the debt. A lawyer for some of the bond funds that appealed Swain’s ruling did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board commenced a form of municipal bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and liabilities incurred by the Caribbean island’s government and its entities. A socalled plan of adjustment the board filed in court in September for Puerto Rico’s core government debt and pension liabilities included an 87% haircut or value reduction for ERS bonds. Prior to its bankruptcy filing, Puerto Rico’s pension system liquidated almost all of its cash assets and the government moved to a payasyougo system in which pension benefits are paid out of the island’s general fund. Meanwhile, bondholders are appealing Swain’s Jan. 7 denial of their motion for the appointment of a trustee to pursue ERS claims arising from the oversight board’s role in the system’s bankruptcy.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-idUSL1N29Z1F5,Reuters,Neutral

Discovery of unused disaster supplies angers Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,1/19/20,"People in a southern Puerto Rico city discovered a warehouse filled with water, cots and other unused emergency supplies, then set off a social media uproar Saturday when they broke in to retrieve goods as the area struggles to recover from a strong earthquake. With anger spreading in the U.S. territory after video of the event in Ponce appeared on Facebook, Gov. Wanda Vázquez quickly fired the director of the island’s emergency management agency.  The governor said she had ordered an investigation after learning the emergency supplies had been piled in the warehouse since Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico in September 2017.  Vázquez said inaction by the fired official, Carlos Acevedo, was unacceptable. “There are thousands of people who have made sacrifices to help those in the south, and it is unforgivable that resources were kept in the warehouse,” the governor said. Puerto Rico’s secretary of state, Elmer Román, told reporters that Acevedo had not told him about the contents of the warehouse. News of the warehouse spread after online blogger Lorenzo Delgado relayed live video on Facebook of people breaking into the building. The scene became chaotic at times as people pushed their way in and began distributing water, baby food and other goods to those affected by the earthquake.  Delgado later told reporters that he had received a tip about the warehouse, but gave no specifics on when.  The mayor of Ponce, María Meléndez, said he had not known about the warehouse and its contents. “This is outrageous,” she said. “Everyone knows what us mayors went through after Hurricane Maria to try and get help to our cities and how we’ve worked these weeks to provide basic supplies to people affected by earthquakes. Those involved owe us an explanation.” Inés Rivera, spokeswoman for the city of Ponce, told The Associated Press that the warehouse is owned by Puerto Rico’s Company of Commerce and Export. Officials with the company could not be reached for comment. The information upset many in Puerto Rico already angry over the government’s botched response to Hurricane Maria, with similar incidents of supplies going unused being uncovered months later. Ponce is one of several cities in the island’s southern region hit by the recent 6.4 magnitude earthquake that killed one person and caused more than an estimated $200 million in damage. More than 7,000 people remain in shelters since the quake.

2 more Puerto Rico officials fired after warehouse break-in,DANICA COTO,1/19/20,"Gov. Wanda Vázquez fired the heads of Puerto Rico’s housing and family departments Sunday in the latest fallout over the discovery of a warehouse filled with emergency supplies dating from Hurricane Maria. The removal of Housing Secretary Fernando Gil and Department of Family Secretary Glorimar Andújar came a day after the governor fired the director of Puerto Rico’s emergency management agency. Vázquez fired him hours after a Facebook video showed angry people breaking into the warehouse in an area where thousands have been in shelters since a recent earthquake. “There have been actions by government officials that have been completely unacceptable,” the governor said Sunday. Vázquez said she decided on the additional firings after meeting with leaders of her administration Sunday morning and officials were unable to provide information she requested about other collection and distribution centers. “They weren’t able to personally tell me specifically where these centers were located, what they contained and whether an inventory was completed,” she said. Vázquez did not elaborate on why Gil and Andújar were singled out, saying only that she had lost confidence in them. Anger erupted in Puerto Rico on Saturday after an online blogger posted a live video of the warehouse in the southern coastal city of Ponce filled with water bottles, cots, baby food and other basic supplies that had apparently been sitting there since Hurricane Maria battered the U.S. territory in September 2017. The blogger, Lorenzo Delgado, said he had received a tip about the warehouse but did not specify when. A group of people broke into the warehouse and began distributing supplies to those affected by the recent 6.4 magnitude quake that killed one person and caused damage across Puerto Rico’s southern region. More than 7,000 people remain in shelters as strong aftershocks continue. Ponce Mayor María Meléndez said she was outraged, noting that she and other mayors were trying to find basic supplies since the quake.  “I spent several days requesting cots and water,” she said. “They sent me to Cabo Rojo for the cots and to San Juan for the water. If I had known that those supplies were there, I would have demanded that they be taken out immediately. ” When asked how it was possible that she did not know about the existence of the warehouse, Vázquez replied, “That’s what the head of agencies are for ... to inform the governor.”  Vázquez said she worried that the warehouse discovery and the fallout would affect the credibility of the territorial government in Washington, which has temporarily retained some federal funds for Maria relief amid concerns of corruption and mismanagement.",https://apnews.com/article/san-juan-emergency-management-latin-america-puerto-rico-hurricanes-19c71cd09651f583a0ed8b630493ea8d,AP,Neutral
"Meteor streaks over Puerto Rico, unsettling some amid quakes",DANICA COTO,1/17/20,"A meteor streaked low across the sky in Puerto Rico on Friday, setting social media abuzz as the spectacle amazed some people and unsettled others on an island still being hit daily by small earthquakes. The bright burning ball was caught by security cameras and people randomly taking pictures and video of other things. Rafael Rivera, a pharmacist, said he saw and heard the fireball as he passed over a toll bridge in northern Puerto Rico, briefly worrying it was a malfunctioning plane. “It was a loud noise,” he said. “I see this ball of fire, very fast and very big, and I said, ‘Wow, that can’t be a plane because it’s going too fast.’”  The meteor was visible across Puerto Rico in broad daylight, said Eddie Irizarry, a Puerto Rico astronomy professor and vice president of the Caribbean Astronomy Society. He said he got reports from all corners of the island. “That makes it into quite a rare event,” he said in a phone interview. Irizarry said that the meteor was visible for up to 10 seconds and that he suspects it was at least a couple of feet in length given reports that it left a smoke trail. Some people on social media reported seeing the meteor hit just off the coast of the capital of San Juan. Those reports could not be immediately verified. Meanwhile, officials at Puerto Rico’s main international airport said they captured the event on camera but flight operations were not interrupted. The event scared many in the U.S. territory that is experiencing strong daily aftershocks following a 6.4 magnitude quake Jan. 7 that killed one person and caused an estimated $200 million in damage along the island’s south coast. Paola Noriega, a chef, said she saw the fireball while standing outside in San Juan. “With all this trauma that we have as a result of the earthquakes ... one could think it’s something catastrophic,” she said. Her father, appraiser Juan Noriega, watched the spectacle with her. “All of a sudden, I see a giant ball going across the sky,” he said. “It was orange in color, and coming in like a jet throwing off fumes.”",https://apnews.com/ecddd7b73ef5858de829d9fc1ea084aa,AP,Neutral
"Trump declares Puerto Rico quake disaster, ties strings to relief",Andrew Hay,1/16/20,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday declared a major disaster in earthquakehit Puerto Rico, boosting aid to the island a day after placing tougher restrictions on billions of dollars in delayed hurricane relief. FILE PHOTO: A general view of a damaged church after the earthquake in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, January 9, 2020. REUTERS/Marco BelloRepublican Trump has repeatedly clashed with Puerto Rico, calling the island “one of the most corrupt places on earth. ” He faced pressure to make the declaration from fellow Republican legislators in states such as Florida, who have large Puerto Rican constituencies. Wanda Vazquez, governor of the U.S. territory, requested the aid after a Jan. 7 earthquake and aftershocks collapsed or damaged hundreds of homes in southern Puerto Rico, sending 8,000 people fleeing to shelters. The declaration gives residents in hardhit southern towns access to federal grants for home repairs and temporary housing. On Wednesday, the Trump administration imposed dozens of new conditions on the island’s government to access $8. 3 billion in delayed recovery funds for Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Trump has described Puerto Rico’s leaders as either “incompetent or corrupt” and officials said the conditions were necessary to get the funds to Puerto Ricans. “Trump is working to ensure the people of Puerto Rico are getting the funds they need, while also holding the Puerto Rican government accountable,” said Chase Jennings, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. Democratic legislators said Trump was holding Puerto Rico to a higher standard than U.S. states and called on Trump to release tens of billions more in delayed hurricane aid. “The president considers disaster recovery money nothing more than a bargaining chip in his petty political vendetta against people of color,” said U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, among House Democrats who proposed $3. 35 billion in earthquake aid for Puerto Rico. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, supported the new conditions as a way to release stalled aid. “At least there’s a path to getting the money out,” he said. The U.S. government has distributed around $15 billion of the $44 billion in aid the U.S. Congress approved for Puerto Rico after the hurricanes that killed about 3,000 people. Among new restrictions on the relief is a requirement Puerto Rico’s government get approval for aid spending from the island’s Fiscal Control Board, a federallyappointed agency for restructuring the territory’s debt. The requirements also block spending on Puerto Rico’s ageing electricity grid and suspend its $15perhour minimum wage for federal relief work.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-quake-idUSKBN1ZF2N5,Reuters,Neutral
Experts seek answers behind constant quakes in Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,1/15/20,"Seismologists in southern Puerto Rico gingerly walked around a patch of dirt that marks the location of recently buried sensors they hope will reveal answers behind the constant and unusual shaking in the region that has terrified residents. Alena Leeds with the U.S. Geological Survey stopped in front of the sensors on Tuesday afternoon and scrutinized the information that popped up on the screen in front of her. “Here comes one! There’s an aftershock,” she said as the software showed red, blue and green lines that squiggled up and down. More than 1,280 earthquakes have hit Puerto Rico’s southern region since Dec. 28, more than two dozen of them magnitude 4.5 or greater, according to the USGS. Among them was a 6.4 magnitude quake that hit on Jan. 7, killing one person and injuring nine others, and a 5.9 magnitude aftershock that occurred Saturday, causing further damage. Government officials say the quakes have caused a preliminary $110 million in damage, toppled part of a famed rock formation landmark and damaged or destroyed more than 550 homes. The seismic activity that experts say is unusual but not unexpected has unleashed scientific debate about what’s causing it and drawn international attention to the area, where more than 4,000 people have sought shelter as they wonder when the ground will stop trembling. “I don’t plan on stepping foot in the house for any reason until this stops,” said Adrián Santos, a 45-year-old mechanic who has been living in a tent in the southern coastal city of Ponce for nearly a week with nine other relatives. “The shaking is unbearable.” Scientists say they don’t yet know much about the faults causing the quakes, although some experts believe at least three faults are involved, including the Punta Montalva one in southwest Puerto Rico that students and professors at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez discovered in the early 2000s. “There are a lot of different opinions but not a lot of data,” said Elizabeth Vanacore, an associate research professor at the university, which also houses the island’s Seismic Network. Overall, Puerto Rico is located in a very seismically active area, with the North America and Caribbean tectonic plates converging at a rate of about 2 centimeters a year, said Gavin Hayes, a USGS research geophysicist. To the north part of the island, the North America plate is moving past and sinking below Puerto Rico, while in the southern region, the Caribbean plate is sinking into the mantel underneath the island. “Essentially, the island is being squeezed between these two tectonic plates,” he said. In the last 50 years, 10 earthquakes of magnitude 4 and higher have occurred within 50 kilometers of the recent 6.4 magnitude epicenter prior to Dec. 28, said Lindsay Davis, with USGS’s earthquake disaster assistance team manager. She said the rate of aftershocks following the 6.4 magnitude quake is higher than expected, but still within normal range. She also said Saturday’s 5.9 magnitude quake was within the range of what was expected for the aftershock sequence. Experts say the likeliest scenario is that the frequency of aftershocks will decrease in the next 30 days, noting that moderately sized ones could still further damage structures. A less likely scenario is another earthquake just as strong as the 6.4 one occurs in the same area, an event known as a doublet. A much less likely scenario is that an earthquake significantly larger than the 6.4 one hits Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, scientists are still investigating the reason behind the constant shaking, fascinated that the aftershocks — in a departure from normal behavior — seem to be occurring along several faults, including the Punta Montalva one. “Some of them we don’t even know they’re there until they talk,” said Leeds, the USGS seismologist. “And now it’s talking very loudly.”",https://apnews.com/88b9ce52a088d6962c2c431ab762f801,AP,Neutral
Experts warn Puerto Rico not prepared for big earthquakes,DANICA COTO,1/13/20,"More than two years ago, Hurricane Maria revealed that Puerto Rico was utterly unprepared for a powerful hurricane despite its location in one of the world’s most storm-vulnerable regions. Now, a flurry of earthquakes topped by a magnitude 6.4 temblor that killed one person and damaged hundreds of buildings has many accusing the government of being caught unready again. “It proved that Puerto Rico is not prepared for a seismic movement,” said Nazario Lugo, president of the island’s Association of Emergency Managers. “The government has to be proactive, and we saw that was not the case until they were up to their neck in water.” Lugo, a former emergency management director for Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press that the government didn’t activate its emergency command center until the day after the largest quake hit, breaking with protocol. This drew comparisons to Hurricane Maria of 2017, which devastated the island and caused thousands of deaths. Critics said it caught the local and federal governments with limited supplies on an island with poorly maintained infrastructure and led to a delayed response stemming from a lack of communication and organization. A flurry of hundreds of small quakes began hitting Puerto Rico on Dec. 28, and a magnitude 5.8 jolt that toppled a famed rock formation landmark struck on Jan. 6, Three Kings’ Day, a major holiday on the island. “The first day, when toys were being handed out, they should have started a process to activate the emergency plan,” he said. That didn’t happen until Tuesday’s 6.4 earthquake hit before dawn. It knocked out power to the entire island, collapsed several homes and schools and cracked bridges. Many living along the southern coastline were left without water service and more than 4,900 people sought refuge in government shelters. While many Puerto Ricans were surprised, scientists were not, including Christa von Hillebrandt, former director of the island’s Seismic Network and manager of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Caribbean tsunami warning program. “For decades, scientists and people like me have been informing and alerting communities and the government of Puerto Rico of the physical threat,” she said. “In the past 30 years, seismic conscience definitely improved in Puerto Rico, but not much action was taken. ... You would see some improvements, but some critical areas did not receive sufficient attention.”  Just days after the natural disaster, emergency management Director Carlos Acevedo acknowledged to reporters that the government had yet to complete a plan that dictates protocol for when an earthquake hits the island. Juan Alicea, president of Puerto Rico’s Society of Professional Engineers, told the AP that he received a draft of the plan only on Jan. 5. “I see that as a failure,” he said. “We all have to assume our responsibilities.” Acevedo did not return messages for comment and has insisted that Puerto Rico is prepared in case another big quake strikes. Von Hillebrandt partially agreed with that assessment, noting that local officials had identified all tsunami risk zones by 2003 and completed evacuation maps in 2015. By 2016, all coastal communities in Puerto Rico were certified as being ready for a tsunami. In October 1918, a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near Puerto Rico’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people. While concerns remain about Puerto Rico’s preparedness, federal authorities have praised the local government’s response. Jeff Byard, with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, said he is extremely pleased with the post-quake operation. “I cannot commend the commonwealth enough for the proactive nature that they’ve taken providing the initial resources, the initial support,” he said. More than 1,280 earthquakes have hit Puerto Rico’s southern region since Dec. 28, more than two dozen of them magnitude 4.5 or greater, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Given that activity, Alicea said it’s extremely worrisome that some 200,000 homes across Puerto Rico are not built to code, as evidenced by the damage caused in recent days. “If we don’t take action, this is going to cost us a lot of money and a lot of lives,” he said.  Also of concern is that some 500 public schools across Puerto Rico were built before 1987 and don’t adhere to new construction codes, placing students at risk, according to Alicea. He said the government has invested money to bring many other schools up to date, but the remaining ones are not built to withstand earthquakes. Tuesday’s quake flattened several schools and damaged an estimated two dozen overall, forcing education officials to postpone the start of classes by two weeks and only open schools that have passed inspection. Government officials have said they are identifying the most vulnerable schools and creating a plan to strengthen them, a process that could take months and cost between $1 million and $5 million per school. By early Monday afternoon, 45% of schools had been inspected.  Meanwhile, people like Nancy Torres, 58, vow they will not return home until the shaking stops. She was sleeping in a small, four-door compact car with her husband in the front and their 21-year-old son crammed in the back. Her father-in-law had built the house where they were sleeping when the earthquake hit, and she doesn’t trust it. “I couldn’t even get up from my bed,” she said of the day the big quake struck, adding that if she goes into the home, it’s for very brief periods. “I can’t even take a proper shower.”",https://apnews.com/8d5cbcf5b342038bd164fb7f0a5f081c,AP,Neutral
Magnitude 5.9 shock again rocks quake-stunned Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,1/11/20,"A magnitude 5.9 quake shook Puerto Rico on Saturday, causing millions of dollars of damage along the island’s southern coast, where previous recent quakes have toppled homes and schools. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 8:54 a.m. (1254 GMT) quake hit 8 miles (13 kilometers) southeast of Guanica at a shallow depth of 3 miles (5 kilometers). It was followed by several aftershocks, including a magnitude 5.2 temblor less than two minutes later. No injuries or deaths were reported, officials said. Saturday’s quake occurred four days after a 6.4 magnitude quake in the same area and amid a spate of more than 1,200 mostly small quakes over the past 15 days, all at shallow depths. Gov. Wanda Vazquez estimated damage from Tuesday’s earthquake at $110 million, with a total of 559 structures affected. She said her administration was immediately releasing $2 million to six of the most affected municipalities. Vázquez is seeking a major disaster declaration from the U.S. government, which would free up more federal funds.  As a result of Saturday’s quake, Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority said outages were reported across much of southern Puerto Rico and crews were assessing possible damage at power plants. Officials said they also were going back to reassess all structures previously inspected, given the strength of Saturday’s quake. Deputy Mayor Elizabeth Ocasio in the southern coastal city of Ponce told The Associated Press that officials closed the city’s downtown area and two other nearby areas because of weakened infrastructure. “One building completely collapsed,” she said. “There is a lot of historic infrastructure in Ponce.”  Bárbara Cruz, a prosecutor who was in Ponce when the new quake hit, said concrete debris hit the sidewalk as buildings continued to crumble. “Everyone is out on the street,” she said. More landslides and damaged homes were reported, along with severe cracks on a bridge in the southwest coastal town of Guanica, where Aurea Santiago, a 57-year-old resident, said she saw big boulders falling on a nearby road. “We have been through a lot, but what’s important is that we are alive, and people are helping us,” she said. The quake, which initially had been calculated at magnitude 6.0, was the strongest shake since Tuesday’s magnitude 6.4 quake — the most potent to hit the island in a century. That temblor killed one person, injured nine others and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and several schools and businesses in the island’s southwest region. More than 4,000 people have been staying in shelters, many fearful of returning to their homes, and others unable to because of extensive damage. The director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, ordered the temporary closure of the company’s largest plant, which crews had been inspecting for damage caused by earlier quakes. The ground in southwest Puerto Rico has been shaking since Dec. 28, with more than 1,280 earthquakes, of which more than 100 were felt and more than 70 were of magnitude 3.5 or greater. NASA reported Friday that the quakes had moved the land in parts of southern Puerto Rico as much as 5.5 inches (14 centimeters), based on satellite images before and after the temblors. Víctor Huérfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told the AP that he expects still more aftershocks as a result of the latest large one. “It’s going to re-energize an unstable situation,” he said, adding that seismologists are studying which faults were activated. “It’s a complex zone.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-us-news-earthquakes-fd6b234395379a876bddc74e1b882d43,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico earthquake aftermath deepens as govt seeks help,DÁNICA COTO,1/10/20,"More than 2,000 people in shelters. Nearly one million without power. Hundreds of thousands without water. The aftermath of a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that killed one person, injured nine others and severely damaged infrastructure in Puerto Rico’s southwest coast is deepening as the island’s government says it is overwhelmed. Many in the affected area are comparing the situation to Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit in September 2017, as hundreds of families who are unable to return to their damaged homes wonder where they’ll stay in upcoming weeks and months as hope fades of electricity being restored soon. “We have to remain outside because everything inside is destroyed,” said 84-year-old Brunilda Sánchez, who has been sleeping outdoors in a government-supplied cot in the southwest coastal town of Guánica. “We don’t know how long we’ll have to stay here.” U.S. President Donald Trump declared an emergency in Puerto Rico several hours after Tuesday’s quake hit, a move that frees up federal funds via the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency for things ranging from transportation to medical care to mobile generators. But some local officials worry the help won’t arrive soon enough. “FEMA is a very bureaucratic agency and it moves very slowly. So slowly that we’re still waiting for federal funds from Maria,” Daniel Hernández, director of generation for Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told The Associated Press. He said FEMA has already pledged to bring mobile generators to bolster the company’s biggest plant, which is located near the island’s southern coast where the quake hit and is severely damaged. Hernández said it’s unclear how quickly the plant can be repaired, noting that a damage assessment is ongoing, although some officials estimated it could take up to one year to repair. Complicating efforts to restore power are strong aftershocks, with more than 40 earthquakes with a 3.0-magnitude or higher occurring since Tuesday’s quake, according to experts. Every time it shakes, personnel have to evacuate and further damage to the plant’s infrastructure is feared, Hernández said. Power company director Jose Ortiz said he expects nearly all customers to have electricity by early next week, adding that extremely preliminary assessments show that at least $50 million in damage occurred. On Thursday, transportation officials closed a portion of one of Puerto Rico’s busiest highways because of what they called serious structural failures related to the quake. Both directions of Highway 52 that runs from the capital of San Juan to the southern coastal city of Ponce were indefinitely closed near Ponce. Meanwhile, those aftershocks have led to a rise in the number of people seeking shelter in southwest Puerto Rico as government officials continue to inspect homes and public housing complexes. Fernando Gil, secretary of Puerto Rico’s Housing Department, urged people to stay with family or in shelters if they felt unsafe in their homes as the government relocated more than two dozen people from damaged residences. “Meanwhile, we will continue to identify what kind of help is needed to support all affected families,” he said. The future of hundreds of schoolchildren in the island’s southwest region also is uncertain as officials delayed the start of classes that was scheduled for Thursday. A three-story school in Guánica that houses nearly 450 children alone saw its first two floors flattened by the quake. There were no children in the school at the time. Education officials said 24 schools were affected by the quake but that teams of engineers were inspecting all of the island’s schools. They said it’s too early to say when classes might start. While officials say it’s too early to provide an estimate of total damage, they say hundreds of homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday’s quake and the 5.8-magnitude one that preceded it on Monday. Teresa Arroyo, a 47-year-old resident of the southern town of Peñuelas, said her home is heavily damaged but she plans to stay there. “Where else am I supposed to go?” she said. “Everyone is depressed. This is serious.”",https://apnews.com/c98011f288283c93b2273aa8de91e040,AP,Neutral
6.4 quake strikes Puerto Rico amid heavy seismic activity,DANICA COTO,1/7/20,"Thousands of people fled their homes on Puerto Rico’s southwest coast on Tuesday after a 10-day string of earthquakes crescendoed in a powerful magnitude 6.4 temblor that crushed an elderly man, injured at least eight other people and sent buildings tumbling to the ground.  Hours after the predawn quake cut power to the entire U.S. territory, a large swath of southern Puerto Rico was shaken by smaller quakes late into Tuesday afternoon. Seismologists said there was no way of knowing when the series of quakes would ease, prompting Puerto Ricans to stay with friends or family or even sleep outdoors far from the coast, fearful of collapsing buildings or a tsunami.  “I’m stringing up my hammock,” said Miguel Santana, a 38-year-old resident of the southwest coastal town of Guayanilla. Alexandra Colberg, 27, moved out of her deeply cracked home in the nearby town of Guánica with her husband and four children, packing their mattresses, a refrigerator, a set of curtains and their clothes into two pickup trucks. “What do I do with this?” asked her 9-year-old son, holding a tiny pink bucket with a pet fish that survived the earthquake. “We need to go, because if not we could end up falling down there,” Colberg said as she gestured to the ground floor from the second story of her home. She and her family soon left for the mountain town of Hormigueros, where Colberg’s grandmother lives. Most of the damage occurred in Guánica, where a three-story school collapsed. Preparing to start a 12-hour shift to protect it from looters was María Mercedes Alcázar, a 63-year-old private security guard who said she didn’t fear earthquakes, but her children, aged 37 and 42, were jittery. A friend who dropped Alcázar off at the school, 49-year-old construction worker Mario Cruz, said he remains terrified. “I’m not right, emotionally,” he said. “I don’t want to feel another one.” The morning quake cut electricity to the island as power plants shut down to protect themselves. Authorities said two plants suffered light damage and they expected power to be restored later Tuesday. Puerto Rico’s main airport was operating normally, using generator power.  Puerto Rico’s governor, Wanda Vásquez, declared a state of emergency and activated the territory’s National Guard. She said some 300,000 households remained without running water late Tuesday, and several hundred people were in shelters. “We’re talking about an event that Puerto Rico hasn’t experienced in 102 years and we’re talking about something that we can’t predict,” she said. Tuesday’s quake was the strongest to hit Puerto Rico since October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people. Puerto Rico is in an area prone to earthquakes, but Tuesday’s quake was unusual because it struck just off the southern coast, said John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado. Most large quakes in the area happen some 60 to 80 miles off Puerto Rico’s north coast, he said. Since 1950, there have now been five quakes of magnitude 6.0 or larger near Puerto Rico, and all the others have been far to the north, he said. But since Dec. 31, more than 950 quakes and aftershocks have been recorded in the area of Tuesday night’s event, most too weak to be felt, according to USGS.  The Caribbean islands are prone to quakes because they’re at a spot where two tectonic plates meet in a complex dance. The North American plate is being driven below the Caribbean plate in some parts of the area, and the two plates are also rubbing each other sideways, Bellini said. As the plates move, they build up stress, eventually causing an earthquake. The unusual location of Tuesday’s quake means scientists don’t have a detailed historical record to draw upon in trying to assess future activity, Bellini said. Residents can expect aftershocks for some weeks, but they will peter out in both size and frequency and eventually end, he said.  The USGS said that while it’s virtually certain there will be many aftershocks in the next week, the chance of a magnitude 6 quake -- similar to Tuesday’s -- or stronger is around 22 percent. The risk of a magnitude 7 quake or bigger is extremely low, USGS said. Teacher Rey González told The Associated Press that his uncle was killed when a wall collapsed on him at the home they shared in the city of Ponce. He said 73-year-old Nelson Martínez was disabled and that he and his father cared for him.  Eight people were injured in Ponce, officials said. Hundreds of people sat in the streets of the city, some cooking food on barbecue grills, afraid to return home for fear of structural damage and aftershocks.  U.S. President Donald Trump was briefed on the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in the past month, including the one on Tuesday, said Judd Deere, White House deputy press secretary.  “Administration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials,” Deere said.  In the historic district of Ponce, authorities evacuated more than 150 people from two buildings they said were in danger of collapsing. Among them were more than two dozen elderly patients from a nursing home who sat in their wheelchairs in silence as the earth continued to tremble. Much of the damage was reported in Guayanilla, where the mayor said the municipality won’t have power for at least two weeks. A 19th-century church in Guayanilla partially collapsed. Ruth Caravallo, 73, held on to the church’s wrought-iron gate as she cried. “My sister was the secretary here,” she said. “My husband died two months ago, and I held services for him here.” Around the corner, the Rev. Melvin Díaz spoke to a friend on the phone and described damage to the church’s icons. “The Virgin fell, Saint Judas is intact,” he said. Díaz surveyed the collapsed church and said he was optimistic about rebuilding. “This isn’t a problem, it’s a challenge,” he said.  Some people rode their bicycles around the public plaza while others sought shade under lush trees that shook occasionally as the aftershocks continued. A magnitude 5.8 quake that struck early Monday morning collapsed five homes in Guánica and heavily damaged dozens of others. It also caused small landslides and power outages. The quake was followed by a string of smaller temblors. The shake collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in Guayanilla. ______ Correspondents Malcolm Ritter in New York and Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-earthquakes-latin-america-e2ec8e9bd12aea8aff6b240976897389,AP,Neutral
"5.8 magnitude quake strikes Puerto Rico, damaging homes",DÁNICA COTO,1/7/20,"A 5.8 magnitude quake hit Puerto Rico before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and collapsing some homes, as well as a famed tourist attraction. It was one of the strongest quakes yet in a series that have hit the U.S. territory over the past week. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake was followed by a string of smaller temblors, including one measured at magnitude 5 that struck at 10:51 a.m. (1451 GMT), shaking power lines and frightening residents of southern Puerto Rico who had been waiting outside their homes due to fears the buildings were damaged and unstable.  The first quake struck at 6:32 a.m. (1032 GMT) just south of the island at a relatively shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The shake collapsed a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, Punta Ventana, that was a popular tourist draw in the southwest town of Guayanilla. In the southern town of Guanica, Mayor Santos Seda told The Associated Press that five homes collapsed, but only one of them was inhabited. No injuries had been reported. Another 29 homes were heavily damaged and about to collapse, he said. Helicopters buzzed overhead and terrified residents jumped up from their folding chairs every time the earth shook, yelling at others to stay away from power lines. Few people dared go back inside their homes, but José Quiñones, 54, had no choice. His 80-year-old mother had heart problems and was lying in bed. Dozens of people in a neighborhood called Hope in Guanica walked around with their phones and yelled out the magnitude of the latest earthquakes as they tried to calm children who were forced to open the presents they’d received for Three Kings Day, a religious holiday, on streets and sidewalks. “This is hell,” said Albert Rodríguez, 43, whose home collapsed on one side as the smell of gas filled the air. “We haven’t slept.... You can’t remain calm here. Guanica is no longer a safe place.” Less than a block away, Silvestre Alicea surveyed his home, which collapsed on his prized blue 1977 Toyota Corolla as he leaped from the balcony. Alicea had lived in New York for years until he retired to Guanica two years ago to live in the home he spent 15 years building. He doesn’t have insurance. People in the working-class neighborhood shared soda and snacks as they sought shelter from a harsh sun, careful to stay away from homes whose columns and foundations were heavily cracked. Many already had bags packed in their cars with a change of clothes, food, water and medicine.  Some like Noelia De Jesús, 69, and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, didn’t know where they would spend the night. Government officials who inspected their home earlier in the morning said it was unsafe to live in and advised them to stay elsewhere. “Everything broke, including the TV,” she said. “This is horrible.” Puerto Rico doesn’t have a public earthquake warning system, except for sirens that are supposed to ring in case of a tsunami. Residents in this neighborhood criticized the government for what they believe is a lack of action. Dr. Sindia Alvarado, who lives in the southern coastal town of Penuelas, said she was petrified. “My entire family woke up screaming,” she said. “I though the house was going to crack in half.” The flurry of quakes in Puerto Rico’s southern region began the night of Dec. 28, with quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1. Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and knocked goods off supermarket shelves. Victor Huerfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told the AP that shallow quakes were occurring along three faults in Puerto Rico’s southwest region: Lajas Valley, Montalva Point and the Guayanilla Canyon. He said the quakes overall come as the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeeze Puerto Rico, and that more earthquakes and aftershocks are expected, although officials expect them to eventually taper off.

'Everyone's scared': Puerto Rico declares emergency after earthquakes,Luis Valentin Ortiz,1/7/20,"Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez declared a state of emergency on Tuesday after a series of earthquakes killed at least one person, toppled buildings and knocked out power to nearly the entire island of more than 3 million people. Puerto Rico declares emergency after earthquakes Puerto Rico declares emergency after earthquakes00:48The largest of the quakes in the U.S. territory registered at magnitude 6. 4, the most powerful to hit the Caribbean island in 102 years. With two large power plants shut down, drinking water was cut off to at least 300,000 customers, Vazquez told a news conference. She said power should be restored to most of the island within 24 to 48 hours. Puerto Rico schools will remain closed and public employees, other than health workers and police, will stay home on Wednesday while checks are made on the structural safety of buildings, Vazquez said. “There are people who have lost their lives, there are people who have lost all their property,” She told reporters, without giving further details on the extent of damage and injuries. Puerto Rico’s electricity authority said it hoped to reestablish services during the night in the metropolitan area of San Juan, the capital, which is home to about 2. 3 million people. At least 346 people were left homeless, officials said, after homes were flattened, mostly in the south of the island. Many damaged buildings sat next to piles of rubble. Bottled water, batteries and flashlights ran low at San Juan supermarkets and ice was scarce as residents tried to keep food from rotting, said resident Luis Borri, 31. “Water is running out, people are grabbing like 10 boxes,” said Borri, who recharged his cellphone at San Juan’s international airport where he works and where backup generators allowed normal services to continue.

Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said President Donald Trump authorized the agency to coordinate all disaster relief efforts. HURRICANES AND BANKRUPTCYPuerto Rico has been rocked by hundreds of quakes since Dec. 28, including 10 of magnitude 4 or greater, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Powerful quakes are rare in Puerto Rico. A 7. 3 magnitude quake that occurred in 1918 triggered a tsunami and killed 116 people, according to the island’s seismology office. “Everyone’s scared, it’s the first time anything like this has happened,” said San Juan resident Patricia Alonso, 48, who with her 13yearold son was heading to her mother’s apartment building, which had power from an emergency generator. Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 killed about 3,000 people and destroyed a significant amount of infrastructure. Puerto Rico is also working through a bankruptcy process to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. “We are a resilient people. We have responded to many difficult situations. Now this has been asked of us one more time,” said Vazquez, who assumed office in August after Ricardo Rossello stepped down over a scandal involving offensive chat messages and government corruption. Slideshow ( 15 images )One of Tuesday’s quakes triggered an automatic shutdown of electricity across the island as a safety measure and a later, more powerful quake damaged power plants in the southern part of the island, Vazquez said. A 73yearold man died after a wall fell on him, and a power plant worker was hospitalized after he was hit by debris, the governor said. Tuesday’s magnitude 6. 4 quake struck at a depth of 6 miles (10 km) at 4:24 a. m. (0824 GMT) near Ponce on the island’s southern coast, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

"Quake rattles Puerto Rico, damages homes on southern coast",Reuters Staff,1/6/20,"A 5. 8magnitude earthquake off the southern coast of Puerto Rico on Monday damaged homes and destroyed a rock formation on a beach that had been a tourist attraction, but there were no reports of injuries. The quake was shallow at 3. 7 miles (6 km) beneath the surface with an epicenter 8 miles (13 km) southsoutheast of Indios, the U.S. Geological Survey said, enough to rattle the southwestern corner of the Caribbean island. It was the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the area over the past two weeks. Several homes were knocked off their pillars in the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla. Television images showed a number of elevated homes that crushed vehicles parked beneath the main floor. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said his office would be in contact with local and federal authorities to determine if government aid was needed for the U.S. territory. Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez said she convened a meeting of her security team, which was assessing the damage. Guayanilla also lost a tourist attraction called the Window of the Caribbean, a rock formation jutting into the sea that formerly featured a doughnutlike hole that provided a frame for the seascape behind it. With the quake, the top layer of rock and earth fell into the water.

"Puerto Rico to approve cockfighting, defy federal ban",DANICA COTO,12/18/19,"Puerto Rico will defy the U.S. government and approve a law to keep cockfighting alive in a bid to protect a 400-year-old tradition practiced across the island despite a federal ban that goes into effect this week, officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. The move brought cautious rejoicing in the cockfighting business despite concerns that the U.S. territory is trying to override a federal law that President Donald Trump signed a year ago. “We are certainly challenging a federal law. We know what that implies,” Rep. Gabriel Rodríguez Aguiló, who co-authored the bill, told the AP.  He said that Gov. Wanda Vázquez was scheduled to sign the bill Wednesday morning and that he expected the fight to end up in federal court. As word spread, those in the cockfighting industry cheered the news. “There’s going to be work!” exclaimed Domingo Ruiz, who owns more than 30 cocks and has spent more than half a century in the business. “We’re going to keep the fight alive.” Cockfighting generates an estimated $18 million a year and employs some 27,000 people, according to the bill approved by Puerto Rico’s House and Senate.  Puerto Rico has 71 cockfighting establishments in 45 municipalities licensed by the island’s Department of Sports and Recreation, said Secretary Adriana Sánchez. She defended the cockfighting tradition and contended the U.S. government banned fights for economic and not animal welfare reasons. “Their instinct is to fight,” she said of people in the business. “The people who dedicate themselves care for them and train them.” Animal rights activists have long pushed to end cockfights in U.S. territories, saying they are cruel and noting they are illegal in all 50 U.S. states. Wayne Pacelle, founder of the Washington- based Animal Wellness Action, said he doesn’t believe the statistics on Puerto Rico cockfighting. “They are widely exaggerating the economic value,” he said. “Watching animals slash each other just for human entertainment and gambling is not judged as a legitimate enterprise by mainstream people.” The measure says it is legal for Puerto Rico to host cockfights as long as people don’t export or import cocks or any goods or services related to cockfighting. The latter actions would violate the federal law, based on how Puerto Rico officials interpret it. “It remains to be seen whether that’s how federal authorities understand it,” said Rep. Luis Vega Ramos. Vega sought unsuccessfully to amend the measure to add authorization for local officials to not cooperate with federal agents in prosecuting people for cockfighting. But several municipalities, including the capital of San Juan, have authorized municipal police not to crack down on cockfighting.",https://apnews.com/article/san-juan-latin-america-puerto-rico-ap-top-news-caribbean-7d45a1214735e7804833c4b7eab7dce7,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico cries foul over U.S. Congress's cockfighting ban,Reuters Staff,12/18/19,"An attempt by the U.S. Congress to ban cockfighting in Puerto Rico has set off a debate about animal cruelty, put thousands of jobs at risk and sparked a possible power struggle between the U.S. territory’s government and Washington. Puerto Rico cries foul over U.S. Congress's cockfighting ban Puerto Rico cries foul over U.S. Congress's cockfighting ban01:33The 500yearold tradition of cockfighting in Puerto Rico was due to end on Friday under a law passed by Congress last year to bring the island in step with prohibition in every U.S. state. But Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez on Wednesday signed legislation designed to allow cockfighting to continue. That could set up a conflict with U.S. federal authorities. Puerto Rican fans see cockfighting as part of their cultural heritage and say 27,000 jobs could be lost among breeders, food suppliers and others if the ban goes ahead. They bristle at being ordered to end fights by Congress, where the island’s 3 million people have no elected voting representative. “This is an abuse the U.S. government is committing against our culture,” said fighting cock owner Carlos Junior Aponte Silva. Animal rights groups say cockfighting is cruel. The birds have spikes attached to their legs by owners to cause more damage to opponents as men gather around a pit to watch the combatants peck and scratch each other in 12minute fights. The death of cocks during a bout or shortly afterward is common. The cocks’ lives are miserable even without fighting, says the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group. “Many of these birds spend most of their lives tethered by one leg near whatever object is intended to serve as their shelter, such as an overturned plastic barrel or a small wire cage placed directly on the ground,” PETA says on its website. With Puerto Rico’s economy suffering from a debt crisis and the effects of devastating hurricanes in 2017, breeders say they are prepared to go underground if need be. “If there’s nothing before (December) 21st, well then we’ll continue fighting cocks . . . we will become criminals,” said parttime breeder Elvin Lugo. While it is not clear how the issue will be resolved, the legislation signed by Vazquez also urges negotiations between Puerto Rico and Congress for a fiveyear moratorium on the ban. It also prohibits the trade of fighting cocks between the island and the rest of the United States to ensure there would be no breach of interstate commerce laws if cockfighting continued.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puerto-rico-cockfighting-idUSKBN1YM2E4,Reuters,Neutral
Scientists race to document Puerto Rico’s coastal heritage,DÁNICA COTO,12/2/19,"A group of U.S.-based scientists is rushing to document indigenous sites along Puerto Rico’s coast dating back a couple of thousand years before rising sea levels linked to climate change destroy a large chunk of the island’s heritage that is still being discovered. Scientists hope to use the 3D images they’ve taken so far to also help identify which historic sites are most vulnerable to hurricanes, erosion and other dangers before it’s too late to save the island’s patrimony. “It’s literally being washed away,” said Falko Kuester, director of the Cultural Heritage Engineering Initiative at the University of California, San Diego, which is involved in the project. “A big part of what we’re working on is to make the invisible visible and make sure it stays in our memory.” Also involved in the project are UCSD’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Para la Naturaleza, a nonprofit environmental group based in Puerto Rico. The first site scientists targeted was a large swath along the U.S. territory’s north coast that includes a ceremonial center used by the Taino Indians roughly 2,000 years ago, said Isabel Rivera Collazo, an environmental archaeologist at UCSD who is overseeing the project that began in August 2017. Scientists discovered what appears to be a large settlement just east of the ceremonial site thanks to drones and technology including 3D images, she said. They were also able to determine the shape of the ceremonial site, she added. Armed with that information, scientists used excavations to determine that one of six plazas previously discovered appears to have been used for ceremonial dances and the veneration of ancestors. “The inside of the plaza was intensively trampled,” Rivera said. The Tainos populated various Caribbean islands but were eventually wiped out after the arrival of Christopher Columbus and European settlers. “Up to today, there is still a lot we don’t know about indigenous culture along our coasts,” Rivera said. “It’s not in our history books.” “The entire coast is blanketed with archaeological sites,” she said. “We want to recover that information before it disappears.” Puerto Rico’s Department of Natural Resources has said the sea level around the island is rising by more than 3 millimeters — a little over a tenth of an inch — per year. But climate change has more immediately dramatic effects as well, destroying habitats, eroding coastlines and causing more powerful storm surges when hurricanes hit. Some scientists say that warmer temperatures increase the frequency and intensity of storms. Puerto Rico is exposed to storms every year for six months during the Atlantic hurricane season, and the scientists noted that the storm surge from Hurricane Maria washed away part of the region they’re studying. “It’s literally in the eye of the storm quite regularly,” Kuester said of the island. Eric Lo, an engineer with the UCSD’s cultural heritage initiative, flew to Puerto Rico in August 2017 to launch the project a month before Maria hit the island as a Category 4 hurricane. Lo was surprised at what he saw upon his return to the U.S. territory months later. “Pieces of land where I had stood and flown the drone didn’t exist anymore,” he said. “They were underwater.” Scientists are now trying to determine the extent of coastal erosion in that region and the hurricane’s impact on the archaeological site they are studying. Three-dimensional models based on drone images are being used to measure distances, areas, volumes and explore fine details: “You start asking these details that historically you couldn’t,” Kuester said. The engineering initiative that he oversees has helped explore other historic sites elsewhere, including an underwater cave with prehistoric fossils and a baptistery in Florence, Italy.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-rising-sea-levels-ec14d1d8492b4f9ab1a56efb2cc3d5ef,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico gets near-failing grade on infrastructure report card,Reuters Staff,11/12/19,"Puerto Rico’s roads, ports, energy grid and other infrastructure scored an overall Dminus in the first report card issued for the U.S. commonwealth on Tuesday by an engineering group, which put a price tag of as much as $23 billion over 10 years on needed updates and repairs. Slideshow ( 2 images )The nearfailing grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers comes as the island is still trying to recover from devastating hurricanes that hit in 2017 and as its bankrupt government attempts to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations in federal court. Most of the island’s infrastructure is in “poor condition” and is exhibiting “significant deterioration,” according to the report. Puerto Rico would need to spend an additional $13 billion to $23 billion over 10 years “to update infrastructure in order to support economic growth and competitiveness,” the report said. It added that “when considering deferred maintenance and hurricanerelated recovery projects, the investment gap is even larger. ”So far, the U.S. government has sent the island $14. 4 billion of the $43 billion in disaster funding that has been allocated. The report card assigned the lowest grade of F to Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure, which it said was already in poor condition before Hurricanes Irma and Maria demolished much of the electrical grid, leading to extended blackouts. A $20. 3 billion, 10year plan to modernize and decentralize Puerto Rico’s power network was unveiled last month by Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced. The rest of the island’s infrastructure was determined to be “at risk. ” Dams, bridges and the wastewater system earned Dplus grades, while ports and drinking water were graded D and roads and solidwaste system were a notch lower at Dminus. Recommendations included creating and adhering to a longterm comprehensive infrastructure plan and increasing resilience by building to modern industry standards.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKBN1XM2V0,Reuters,Neutral
Google digitizes artworks in Puerto Rico for 1st time,DÁNICA COTO,11/8/19,"The 1953 painting by Rafael Tufiño Figueroa features his mother with a red scarf on her head, a determined look on her face and heavy expression lines, a depiction of a working-class woman that broke from conventional portraits of the time that focused largely on wealthy men. “Goyita” is one of more than 350 paintings from Puerto Rico that Google Arts & Culture digitized for the first time with help from “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who unveiled late Thursday the online exhibition that features work from four Puerto Rico art institutions.  The aim is to expose the world to Puerto Rico art, preserve it and help museums in the U.S. territory that are struggling to exhibit paintings given space constraints and budget cuts amid a 13-year recession. “It’s a flare out to the world that there’s incredible art here,” Miranda told The Associated Press. “There’s no reason why Puerto Rican art should not be seen on the same stage as the Louvre, the Met and all the incredible other places where Google has come with its cameras to digitize the artwork.” Puerto Rico artwork joins Google’s current online exhibitions and stories from around the world including “Rings from 500 BC,” an up close view of the “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” and a virtual tour of Chichen Itza in Mexico. As part of the project, Google brought its so-called “art camera” for the first time to Puerto Rico, which required special permits, Miranda said. “I’m sure I’m on some kind of watch list,” he said with a laugh. The camera has an extremely high resolution thanks to a 400 millimeter zoom that unveils details invisible to the human eye, including brush strokes. It also allowed those at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture to find the signature of a pioneering female artist, said executive director Carlos Ruiz, adding that the institute was forced to close its national gallery in 2013, leaving works without a permanent space. The camera took thousands of pictures to digitize 48 pieces of Puerto Rico art as it went inches by inches to cover an entire painting, a job that took 30 minutes to several hours depending on the size of the artwork, said Simon Delacroix, U.S. lead for Google Arts & Culture. He traveled to Puerto Rico in July to see the artwork for the first time. “What I was surprised by was the diversity, depth and richness of all these collections,” he told the AP, adding that they only digitized the art that the four museums had selected.  As Delacroix demonstrated the power of the zoom on a painting called “El Gobernador Don Miguel Antonio de Ustáriz,” by José Campeche y Jordán, a collective “Wow” escaped from the audience attending the project unveiling at the Museum of Puerto Rico. The crowd could appreciate details in the background including someone that appears to be laughing from a balcony. Another Puerto Rican artist featured online is Olga Albizu, whose abstract paintings became internationally known when they appeared on the album covers of well-known Bossa Nova singers. Google Arts & Culture already allows users to explore more than 2,000 museums and historic sites including Nelson Mandela’s prison cell. In total, it offers more than 6 million photos, videos and other documents. Next year, the company expects to launch a larger project with more Puerto Rico artwork. ___ On the net: https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/puerto-rico/m05r7t",https://apnews.com/article/technology-entertainment-latin-america-puerto-rico-lin-manuel-miranda-b98f335c77114ecb80ddc68e36f049ed,AP,Neutral

"FBI arrests Puerto Rico senator, 7 more in corruption probe",No Author,11/6/19,"FBI agents arrested Puerto Rico Sen. Abel Nazario and seven other people early Wednesday as part of an investigation into corruption in the U.S. territory. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said the suspects include former municipal employees who were indicted on one count of alleged theft or bribery involving programs that receive federal funds. Some suspects are accused of using more than $5,000 worth of municipal funds to in part pay other suspects to work on Nazario’s senatorial campaign. Authorities said some suspects also helped the campaigns of other politicians whose support was sought by Nazario when he was mayor of the southwest town of Yauco. Among the suspects is the town’s former director of human resources and the mayor’s special assistant. Puerto Rico Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz asked for Nazario’s resignation shortly after his arrest and filed an ethical complaint against him. “It is unfortunate for him and his family, but even more so for the people of Puerto Rico who watch with anguish events that lacerate the trust in government institutions,” Rivera said in a statement. Nazario told reporters he would not step down and said he was innocent. “If the New Progressive Party thinks Abel Nazario is an obstacle, let them expel me. But I am not leaving. This is my home,” he said from his office in the seaside capitol. The arrests come as Puerto Rico recovers from recent political turmoil that saw the resignation of the island’s previous governor following massive protests spurred in part by anger over corruption. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said Puerto Rico’s Comptroller’s Office uncovered the alleged scheme during a routine audit of Yauco’s financial records. Federal authorities previously arrested Nazario in September 2018 and accused him of defrauding his employees while serving as mayor of the southwest town of Yauco. They said his employees were required to work two voluntary hours a day, which the Department of Labor identified as a violation. Nazario agreed to pay nearly $590,000 in back wages to 177 employees, but authorities said they later learned the municipality was withholding employees’ wages despite Nazario’s pledge that he would not retaliate against workers. Nazario is awaiting trial in that case, for which he criticized federal authorities. “Their case is so weak that they’ve spent one year dealing with 37 previous charges,” he said. “Federal authorities came to Puerto Rico and are here to deal with important cases. But they are filing peanuts. ”At that time, Nazario also was vice president of the governor’s New Progressive Party.",https://apnews.com/270083a4ec884d4f899c4758b13b5526,AP,Neutral
"Student: CVS workers rejected Puerto Rico ID, asked for visa",No Author,11/5/19,"CVS apologized and said it’s investigating after a Purdue University engineering student was denied the purchase of over-the-counter cold medicine by employees who questioned his immigration status, refusing to accept his Puerto Rican driver’s license and U.S. passport. José Guzmán Payano said a clerk and shift supervisor at a CVS store in West Lafayette refused to sell him medicine, citing corporate policy that requires customers to show valid ID issued by the U.S., Canada or Mexico. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. The U.S. took control of Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War of 1898. In 1917, Puerto Ricans were given U.S. citizenship through an act of Congress. Guzmán Payano said he tried explaining that Puerto Rico is part of the U.S., but the clerk demanded to see a visa to verify his immigration status before he could purchase his cold medicine. “And then when she asked me for a visa, I was in shock at that time,” he said. “It wasn’t worth talking anymore. “It is weird because we’re such a broad campus at Purdue. There are people from everywhere. But I can’t use my ID from Puerto Rico? Not even my passport? This shouldn’t happen here. Period.” Guzmán Payano, who’s a junior at Purdue, said he left the store without buying the medicine and called his mom in Puerto Rico to explain what happened. Arlene Payano Burgos then took to Facebook to describe her son’s Oct. 25 encounter in a 944-word post that has garnered 11,000 shares. “Needless to say my son, or any other consumer, is not obligated to disclose his immigration status to any CVS employee! What caused this employee to ask him for his visa? Was it his accent? Was it his skin color? Was it the Puerto Rican flag on the license? Whatever triggered her to discriminate against my son embodies exactly what is wrong in the United States of America today,” Payano Burgos wrote in the post. CVS spokeswoman Amy Thibault said the company has reminded employees at that store that identification from Puerto Rico is considered valid. “We are committed to ensuring that every customer receives courteous, outstanding service in our stores, and we apologize to the customer for his recent experience,” Thibault said. “We are fully investigating this matter to learn more about what occurred.”",https://apnews.com/b23b5b45f0c2400e89ddc41e78b6661f,AP,Neutral
U.S. bill would provide Puerto Rico a path to statehood,Reuters Staff,10/29/19,"The question of statehood for Puerto Rico would be put to voters of the U.S. commonwealth for a third time since 2012 under legislation introduced in Congress on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin Baez/File PhotoProponents of the bill said it would provide the island with the same path to statehood taken by Alaska and Hawaii, the last two states admitted to the union. Under the legislation, which has some bipartisan support, a federally authorized referendum would appear on the Nov. 3, 2020, ballot in Puerto Rico. Approval by a majority of the island’s voters would lead to a presidential proclamation within 30 months making Puerto Rico the 51st state. President Donald Trump has called Puerto Rico “one of the most corrupt places on earth,” making the bill’s future murky. The island’s nonvoting congressional representative, Jenniffer GonzalezColon, said the measure has 45 sponsors. The island is still trying to recover from devastating hurricanes that hit in 2017, while it works its way through a bankruptcy process to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. GonzalezColon said the bill provides political equality for Puerto Rico. “The American citizens of Puerto Rico will have the opportunity to participate in a federallysponsored vote and be asked the following question: ‘Should Puerto Rico be admitted as a State of the Union, yes or no?’” she said in a statement. “This is similar to what happened in Alaska and Hawaii, which is what ultimately makes this legislation different. ”In a nonbinding 2017 referendum here, 97% of the island's voters favored statehood, although turnout was just 23% due to a boycott against the vote. In a 2012 vote, 61% of Puerto Ricans favored statehood over other alternatives. Neither results moved Congress to act on statehood. Puerto Rico, which has been governed by the United States since 1899, has suffered the effects of unequal treatment under federal law compared with U.S. states, hindering the island’s development and economy, according to the bill.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKBN1X82RX,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico prepares to bolster power grid battered by Maria,DÁNICA COTO,10/24/19,"Puerto Rico on Thursday unveiled details of a $20 billion plan to strengthen and modernize the U.S. territory’s shaky power grid more than two years after Hurricane Maria as islanders brace for a looming rate hike amid a recession. The 10-year plan aims to bury power lines, increase the use of natural gas and create a transmission and distribution system that will withstand winds of at least 160 mph instead of 145 mph. “I know there’s great concern,” Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez said of recurrent power outages and flimsy repairs made after the Category 4 storm hit in September 2017, leaving some communities without power for 328 days. “Given the condition it’s in, we cannot renovate it in two or three years.” At least 60% of the estimated $20 billion will be used for transmission and distribution repairs, officials said. They expect federal funds will cover at least $13 billion of the overall cost. By year’s end, the government expects to choose the company that will take over the transmission and distribution of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is some $9 billion in debt. The new owner will be responsible for implementing the plan, which also calls for the creation of eight micro grids capable of operating independently if a storm knocked one out. That project, along with certain others, will take up to a decade to complete. “We’re not where we would like to be,” said Ottmar Chávez, director of Puerto Rico’s Central Office for Reconstruction, Recovery and Resiliency. Details of the plan were released the same week that Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Company said a regulatory agency ordered a rate hike increase that goes into effect Nov. 1. The increase depends on consumption and could range from 64 cents to nearly $2 extra a month until mid-2020. The governor said that she disagrees with the increase and that she plans to fight it. “Rate increases right now are unacceptable,” she said. Puerto Rico is mired in a 13-year recession and is struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, which caused more than estimated $100 billion in damage.",https://apnews.com/1bc72e84f242479095fd96cec3266879,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico unveils $20 billion plan to revamp island's power grid,Reuters Staff,10/24/19,"Puerto Rico’s undependable power network would be modernized and decentralized under a $20. 3 billion, 10year plan announced on Thursday by government officials of the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth. The socalled GridMod plan, developed with federal, local and private sector input, targets repair and reconstruction measures designed to strengthen the network and ensure its resilience against natural disasters like the devastating hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico in 2017, according to a statement from Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced’s office. “The GridMod Plan will provide the safe, modern and resilient electricity network that our communities need and deserve,” the governor said, adding that an improved power network will help boost the island’s economy. Puerto Rico and its electric power authority known as PREPA filed for bankruptcy in 2017 just months before hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the power grid. Federal funding would cover about $13 billion of the plan, which also calls for private investment, according to the governor’s statement.

"Slow-moving TS Karen drops heavy rain over Puerto Rico, USVI",DÁNICA COTO,9/25/19,"Tropical Storm Karen drenched the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday as it bore down on an earthquake-shaken Puerto Rico still scarred by a hurricane two years ago. U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. said the storm had already caused mudslides in the territory and major power outages were reported early Tuesday, though he said the cause was not yet clear. “Don’t take the storm lightly,” Bryan said. “It will start to throw massive rain.” Schools and government offices were already ordered closed in Puerto Rico as well as in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, with officials warning people to stay indoors. As the storm approached, Puerto Ricans were shaken from their beds late Monday by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake that hit in the Atlantic near the island at a shallow depth of 6 miles (10 kilometers). Three aftershocks, of magnitude 4.7 and 4.6, followed within less than an hour. No significant damage was reported, said Carlos Acevedo, director of Puerto Rico’s emergency management agency, adding that the concern now was how much rain Karen would drop on the region. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said it could bring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters). Heavy rains were already pelting the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa, where 69-year-old retiree Víctor Ortiz huddled inside his home with his wife. “Every year the storms are stronger and more frequent,” he said, adding that he worried about landslides because he lives in a mountainous region. The National Guard, which was activated by Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez on Monday, carried out a last-minute evacuation of a weeks-old baby from the neighboring island of Vieques, which has been without a hospital since Hurricane Maria hit in 2017. Lt. Col. Paul Dahlen said in a phone interview that the baby was sick and would be taken to a hospital before the storm hits. Karen regained tropical storm strength Tuesday morning after slipping to a tropical depression. Its maximum sustained winds increased in the afternoon to 45 mph (70 kph), with additional strengthening expected in upcoming days. The storm was centered about 65 miles (105 kilometers) south of San Juan and was moving north at 8 mph (13 kph). Forecasters said it was expected to hit Puerto Rico’s southeast region by late afternoon. It was expected to keep heading north after passing over Puerto Rico and stay well east of the Bahamas, the Hurricane Center said. A tropical storm warning remained in effect for Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and forecasters said certain areas could experience stronger winds. Roberto Garcia, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service’s San Juan office, said that some towns in the eastern part of Puerto Rico would likely be hit with moderate to serious flooding, especially those next to mountains. Gov. Vázquez urged people in flood-prone areas to seek shelter, with more than 30 people reported in shelters by Tuesday morning. The island is still recovering from Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm two years ago and is estimated to have caused more than $100 billion in damage. More than 25,000 homes still have blue tarps for roofs and the electric grid remains unstable. “It’s a reality that we might have power outages,” Vázquez said. Farther north, Tropical Storm Jerry was moving northward and was projected to pass near Bermuda by Wednesday morning. It was about 270 miles (435 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda and had sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lorenzo formed over the far eastern Atlantic and was projected to become a major hurricane by the end of the week, though while curving out over open sea away from land. It was centered about 370 miles (595 kilometers) west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph). It was heading west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph).",https://apnews.com/article/san-juan-latin-america-us-virgin-islands-caribbean-tropical-storms-a1f0a26524584c929b9d76331b968613,AP,Neutral
6.0 quake shakes Puerto Rico; no damage immediately reported,DÁNICA COTO,9/24/19,"A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck near Puerto Rico late Monday, rousing and scaring many from their sleep in the U.S. territory. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck 49 miles (79 kilometers) off the island’s northwest coast at a shallow depth of 6 miles (10 kilometers). Three aftershocks, of magnitude 4.7 and 4.6, hit within less than an hour in the same region at the same depth. Kiara Hernández, spokeswoman for the island’s Emergency Management Agency, told The Associated Press that there were no immediate reports of damage and that there was no risk of tsunami. She said emergency management officials were already on alert for the approaching Tropical Depression Karen and communicated quickly with mayors and others across the island to check on any damage. The National Guard also had been activated for the storm, and schools and government offices remained closed as heavy rains were forecast for Puerto Rico on Tuesday, with warnings of possible flooding and landslides. Hernández said crews would be inspecting buildings to ensure their safety. “We will know this information little by little,” she said. The quake was felt across Puerto Rico and was the strongest to hit the island in recent years. While Puerto Rico experiences very small earthquakes on a daily basis that no one feels, seismologists have said it’s rare for bigger ones to strike the island. Yahaida Zabala, a 46-year-old San Juan resident, was asleep when she felt her building sway Monday around 11:23 p.m. “I rushed into my son’s room,” she said. “He was sitting like he was paralyzed.” They ran down the stairs of their building and stood outside with a small group of people awaiting aftershocks. The last strong quake to shake the island in recent years occurred in January 2014, when a magnitude-6.4 tremor struck after midnight just north of the island’s north coast at a depth of 17 miles (28 kilometers). Authorities reported broken windows, a busted water line and cracked floors and walls, along with some power outages. Some 70 aftershocks were reported afterward, with at least three of a magnitude 3.5 or greater. The most damaging earthquake to hit Puerto Rico in recent history occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude-7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, causing a tsunami and killing 116 people. ___ This story has been corrected to show that name of San Juan resident is Yahaida Zabala.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-us-news-caribbean-international-news-582e45144a0c4f09a87f303eefceb542,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico faces slow recovery 2 years after Maria,DÁNICA COTO,9/20/19,"Weekly power outages. Hundreds of uncleared landslides. More than 25,000 homes with blue tarps as roofs. Recovery from Hurricane Maria has been slow as Puerto Rico on Friday remembered those who died two years ago. The Category 4 storm killed an estimated 2,975 people in its aftermath and caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage. It was the strongest storm to hit the U.S. territory in nearly a century, sparking an estimated exodus of nearly 160,000 people to the U.S. mainland. Still delayed are millions of dollars in federal funds that local officials say are needed to repair roads, build new homes and improve the island’s unstable power grid, making it hard for Puerto Rico to recover as it struggles to emerge from a 13-year recession. Officials say the island is not entirely ready to withstand another direct hit at the height of hurricane season, noting that hurricanes Dorian and Jerry passed just northeast of Puerto Rico this month. While U.S. Congress has appropriated nearly $43 billion in federal hurricane recovery funds for Puerto Rico, only $13.3 billion of the $21 billion obligated by the U.S. government has been disbursed, Ottmar Chávez, executive director of the island’s Central Office for Reconstruction and Recovery, told The Associated Press. “We certainly still have many needs, and there’s still work to do,” he said. The state of the power grid remains one of the biggest concerns for Puerto Ricans since reconstruction has not even started. “It’s a project that will take seven years or more,” José Sepúlveda, transmission and distribution engineer for Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told the AP on Friday. He said transmission lines have been repaired and can now withstand winds of 140 mph (225 kph), but distribution lines, of which there are five times more than those of transmission, will likely not survive a Category 2 storm. Sepúlveda said crews also still have to bury power lines that connect to critical infrastructure including hospitals and relocate substations in flood-prone areas. The power company is seeking $8 billion in hurricane recovery funds for upcoming projects, Sepúlveda said, adding that it takes time for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to review those projects. Critics say Puerto Rico’s government also has moved too slowly and accuse it of bureaucracy as the island recovers from recent political turmoil during which it had three governors in less than a week. Concerns about corruption also remain, with federal officials last week arresting a former top FEMA administrator and the former CEO of a power company that obtained $1.8 billion in federal contracts to repair the island’s grid after Maria. The delays in recovery are felt more acutely in the island’s rural and impoverished areas, including the neighborhood of Las Monjas in the capital of San Juan, where a couple of blue roofs still remain. “The owners have had to take out loans because everyone would die waiting for FEMA,” said Ivette Henríquez, a 65-year-old housewife who is also upset that the streetlights where she lives have not been repaired since Maria. Dave Bibo, FEMA’s deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, told the AP that the agency continues to work closely with Puerto Rico’s government. He said FEMA now has six times the stock in warehouses across Puerto Rico than it had prior to Maria, and that more than 2,000 FEMA employees remain on the island. “There’s no question the Maria response and recovery have been among the most challenging missions in FEMA’s history, but we are confident we will support the governor in building back Puerto Rico so it is stronger and more resilient,” he said.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-caribbean-storms-hurricanes-puerto-rico-966a0ad2b5094233a99551843025111f,AP,Neutral
Major plan for Puerto Rico debt coming this month: attorney,Luis Valentin Ortiz,9/11/19,"A longawaited plan to restructure Puerto Rico’s core government debt will finally be filed in court later this month, an attorney for the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s federally created financial oversight board told a federal judge on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin Baez/File PhotoMartin Bienenstock said the latest delay was due to political turmoil on the island that led to last month’s resignation of Governor Ricardo Rossello, who was eventually replaced by Wanda Vazquez. He said while the board expected to file a plan in August, it held off because “it would have jammed” the new governor, who took office on Aug. 7. The board had signaled it could file a plan of adjustment covering roughly $13 billion of bonds and almost $50 billion of unfunded pension obligations as early as April, then set subsequent but vague deadlines in the following months. Puerto Rico entered bankruptcy in May 2017 to restructure $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Bienenstock said “the relationship between the new government and the oversight board is positive. ” Vazquez, who had been Puerto Rico’s justice secretary, has been meeting with oversight board officials. Her predecessor, Rossello, had been at odds with the board over spending priorities and other matters, including proposed pension cuts. Earlier this year, the board asked U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing the island’s bankruptcy cases, to void billions of dollars of general obligation bonds. It also sued certain bondholders to recoup debt service payments and Wall Street banks and firms that participated in debt issuances. The board in June announced deals with some creditors over recovery rates for certain bonds and for a pension restructuring. In July, Swain ordered mediation that could extend into November over the validity of Puerto Rico’s GO and other bonds, as well as for other disputes. So far, Puerto Rico has won court approval for restructurings of debt from its Government Development Bank and Sales Tax Financing Corporation known as COFINA. On Monday, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority move closer to exiting bankruptcy when two holdout bond insurers joined a deal to restructure its debt.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1VW2DU,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. charges FEMA official in Puerto Rico for taking bribes after Hurricane Maria,Reuters Staff,9/10/19,"The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday announced corruption charges against a senior government official and a contractor who oversaw the rebuilding of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017. FILE PHOTO: A man carrying a water container walks next to damaged houses after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File PhotoIn a 15count indictment, U.S. prosecutors allege that Ahsha Tribble, who oversaw the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s efforts to restore electrical power after the hurricane, accepted helicopter rides, hotel rooms and other bribes from Donald Ellison, who was then president of Cobra Acquisitions LLC, which was contracted to do the work. In return, Tribble pressured FEMA and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to steer work to Ellison’s firm, prosecutors said. PREPA said that Cobra was paid $1. 1 billion of a contracted $1. 9 billion. The contracts were canceled by the utility in March when it “became aware of possible irregularities,” PREPA said in a statement on Tuesday. Tribble was not immediately reachable for comment. Ellison, who left Cobra in June, denies wrongdoing and will plead not guilty, his attorney William Leone said in a telephone interview. “This indictment is filled with allegations of innocuous events that somehow the government has cobbled into a theory of bribery,” he said. “It’s not a crime to be friends with people you work with. ”Prosecutors also charged Jovanda Patterson, a former FEMA deputy chief of staff, who they say evaluated Cobra’s work even as she was trying to get a job with the company. Patterson was not immediately reachable for comment. All three defendants have been arrested, officials said. “Defendants arrived in Puerto Rico to allegedly help in the recovery of the devastation left from Hurricane Maria,” U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia RodríguezVélez said at a news conference. “However, they decided to take advantage of the precarious conditions of our power grid and became involved in a bribery and electronic fraud scheme to illegally enrich themselves with our suffering. ”U.S. officials have put tighter spending controls on federal money earmarked for Puerto Rico’s recovery efforts, which have been slow. The indictment follows a recent tweet by President Donald Trump calling Puerto Rico “one of the most corrupt places on earth,” while his White House accused the island of misusing federal money. Nearly $42. 7 billion of federal funds have been allocated to Puerto Rico, which has received $13. 8 billion so far. FEMA, PREPA, and Cobra’s parent company, Mammoth Energy Services Inc, said they were cooperating with the investigation. Charges filed against Tribble and Ellison include conspiracy to commit bribery, honestservices wire fraud and disaster fraud. Prosecutors said they seized $4. 7 million from accounts held by Ellison, as well as a sailboat, a truck and construction equipment. Ellison has sued to try to get that property back. After the hurricane, PREPA, which filed for bankruptcy in 2017, was faced with a decimated electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance. Trump has had disputes with Puerto Rico’s leaders after coming under heavy criticism for a tepid response to the hurricane, which resulted in almost 3,000 deaths.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-fema-idUSKCN1VV2DK,Reuters,Neutral
"AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s swipe at Puerto Rico, G-7 comments",CALVIN WOODWARD and HOPE YEN,8/31/19,"President Donald Trump presented a distorted picture of the auto industry, told a fanciful story about Iran duping Barack Obama and took a misinformed swipe at Puerto Rico just as its residents braced for a catastrophe that didn’t come. A look at some statements by Trump and his team during a week bookended by the Group of Seven summit and the approach of Hurricane Dorian to the U.S. mainland after it brushed past Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. PUERTO RICO TRUMP, on hurricane aid: “Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for ‘anywhere.’” — tweet Tuesday. TRUMP, on Puerto Rico: “Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten.” — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: His figure of $92 billion is wrong, as is his assertion that the U.S. territory has set some record for federal disaster aid. Congress has so far distributed only about $14 billion for Puerto Rico. It’s a false claim he’s made repeatedly. The White House has said the estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $42.7 billion approved. That $50 billion in additional money, however, is speculative. It is based on Puerto Rico’s eligibility for federal emergency disaster funds for years ahead, involving calamities that haven’t happened. That money would require future appropriations by Congress. Even if correct, $92 billion would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost the U.S government more than $120 billion — the bulk of it going to Louisiana. Trump frequently inflates and complains about the amount of disaster aid that Congress “foolishly gave” Puerto Rico after the deadly destruction from Hurricane Maria in 2017. He has talked as if he doesn’t recognize the U.S. territory as American and, in an April tweet, said Puerto Rico officials “only take from USA.” Hurricane Dorian inflicted limited damage in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands before intensifying on its track toward the U.S. mainland. ___ AUTOS TRUMP: “General Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?” — tweet Friday. THE FACTS: That’s inaccurate on several counts. Still a giant, GM did not close factories in the U.S. and move them to China. It set up and expanded operations in China primarily to serve that market. And by many measures, it is the largest U.S. automaker. The company made more money last year than crosstown rivals Fiat Chrysler and Ford, and GM sold more vehicles in the U.S. than the other two. It remains the largest Michigan-headquartered employer in the state, with a workforce of 52,000 outpacing that of Ford, the state government and Fiat Chrysler, according to an analysis this year by Crain’s Detroit Business. In southeast Michigan, it was No. 2, behind Ford, and ahead of Fiat Chrysler. ___ NORTH KOREA VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: “Watching those 55 small, flag-draped caskets come off the plane was an extraordinary experience.  We brought back — we brought back our heroes, and there’s more to come.” — remarks Wednesday to the American Legion veterans group. THE FACTS: No remains of U.S. service members have been returned since last summer and the U.S. suspended efforts in May to get negotiations on the remains back on track in time to have more repatriated this year. The U.S. hopes more remains may be brought home next year. The Pentagon’s Defense POW-MIA Accounting Agency, which is responsible for recovering U.S. war remains and returning them to families, “has not received any new information from (North Korean) officials regarding the turn over or recovery of remains,” spokesman Charles Prichard said last month. He said his agency is “still working to communicate” with the North Korean army “as it is our intent to find common ground on resuming recovery missions” in 2020. Last year, in line with the first summit between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un that June, the North turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of U.S. service members killed in the North during the 1950-53 war. So far, six Americans have been identified from the 55 boxes. U.S. officials have said the North has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of American war remains. Thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former POW camps. The Pentagon estimates that 5,300 Americans were lost in North Korea. ___ TRUMP on North Korea’s leader: “With respect to North Korea — Kim Jong-un, who I’ve got to know extremely well, the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong-un and I think she’d agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” — news conference Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron. THE FACTS: Melania Trump doesn’t know Kim. They have never met. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham clarified the president’s comment, saying Trump confides in his wife on his relationship with Kim and “feels like she’s gotten to know him, too.” ___ IRAN TRUMP on Iran: “We gave them $150 billion and $1.8 billion and we got nothing. ... Look at what they did to John Kerry and to President Obama. Look what happened, where they’re bringing planeloads of cash, planeloads, big planes, 757s, Boeing 757s coming in loaded up with cash. What kind of a deal is that?” — news conference Monday with Macron. THE FACTS: It’s the kind of deal that did not actually take place. When Iran signed the multinational deal to restrain its nuclear development in return for being freed from sanctions, it regained access to its own assets, which had been frozen abroad. There was no $150 billion gift from the U.S. treasury or other countries. Iran was allowed to get its money back. The $1.8 billion refers to a separate matter, also misstated by Trump going back to before the 2016 election. A payout of roughly that amount did come from the U.S. treasury. It was to pay an old IOU. In the 1970s, Iran paid the U.S. $400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured. After the nuclear deal, the U.S. and Iran announced they had settled the matter, with the U.S. agreeing to pay the $400 million principal along with about $1.3 billion in interest. The $400 million was paid in cash and flown to Tehran on a cargo plane. The arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later. In Trump’s telling, one cargo plane with $400 million that was owed to Iran has become “big planes, 757s, Boeing 757s,” loaded with a $1.8 billion giveaway. Kerry was then secretary of state. ___ CLEAN AIR TRUMP: “We’re, right now, having the cleanest air and cleanest water on the planet.” — remarks Monday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. THE FACTS: That’s not true. Air quality hasn’t improved under the Trump administration and dozens of nations have less smoggy air than the U.S. Water? One measure, Yale University’s global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. Over the last two years the U.S. had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier, federal data show. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when the U.S had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980. The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. The nonprofit Health Effects Institute’s State of Global Air 2019 report ranked the United States 37th dirtiest out of 195 countries for ozone, also known as smog, worse than the global average for population-weighted pollution. Countries such as Britain, Japan, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Albania, Cuba, Russia, Vietnam, New Zealand and Canada have less smoggy air. The U.S. ranks eighth cleanest on the more deadly category of fine particles in the air. On environmental quality overall, the Yale index put the U.S. 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1. ___ ENERGY TRUMP: “I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I’ve made that wealth come alive. ... We are now the number one energy producer in the world.” — news conference with Macron. THE FACTS: Sole credit to himself is not accurate. The greatest energy revolution of the past half-century happened on Obama’s watch as U.S. petroleum and natural gas production achieved preeminence. In 2013, the U.S. became the world’s top producer both of natural gas and petroleum hydrocarbons, says the government’s U.S. Energy Information Administration. As for crude oil specifically, the agency says the U.S. became the world’s top crude oil producer last year. That is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began late in George W. Bush’s administration and proceeded apace during the Obama years. The boom came because of fracking and other technology, such as horizontal drilling, that made it possible to find much more oil and gas without drilling more holes. As well, Obama lifted a decades-long ban on shipping U.S. oil overseas in 2015, helping increase demand for U.S. crude. ___ TRUMP, on addressing climate change: “I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. ... I’m not going to lose it on dreams, on windmills, which frankly aren’t working too well.” — news conference with Macron. THE FACTS: In criticizing wind power, Trump misidentified his target. Wind turbines produce energy. Windmills mill grain and flummox Don Quixote. Trump has ascribed a variety of evils to wind power over the years, usually with scant evidence, while praising coal, a well-documented cause of health problems. ___ Associated Press writers Tom Krisher in Detroit and Robert Burns, Jill Colvin, Josh Boak and Michael Biesecker in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",https://apnews.com/5b73234261e14b70916c15ecb8b7ff9b,AP,Neutral
Trump slams 'corrupt' Puerto Rico as Hurricane Dorian skirts island,Andrew Hay,8/28/19,"President Donald Trump lashed out at Puerto Rico on Wednesday, calling it “one of the most corrupt places on earth” before an approaching hurricane skirted the U.S. territory, stirring up memories of previous devastating storms. Road collapses on island as Storm Dorian hits Road collapses on island as Storm Dorian hits00:50Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover from backtoback hurricanes in 2017 that killed about 3,000 people soon after the island filed for bankruptcy. On Wednesday it escaped fresh disaster as Hurricane Dorian avoided the territory and headed northwest toward Florida. Dorian is expected to become a major hurricane that could do severe damage by the time it reaches the U.S. coast late Sunday or early Monday, NHC forecasts show. But as it passed Puerto Rico, the storm was blowing winds far less strong than when Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. Trump, who approved an emergency declaration for the island late on Tuesday evening, fired off a verbal broadside against Puerto Rico’s leaders on Twitter early on Wednesday. “Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!” Trump wrote. Trump has a history of disputes with Puerto Rico’s leaders, after coming under heavy criticism for a tepid response to the 2017 disasters on the island of more than 3 million people. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz hit back at Trump on Twitter on Wednesday, urging him to “get out of the way and make way for those of us who are actually doing the work on the ground. Maybe Trump will understand this time around THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIM; THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS; THIS IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES. ”Earlier in the day, Dorian plowed through the U.S. Virgin islands and Culebra, an island belonging to Puerto Rico, data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) showed. Slideshow ( 16 images )By Wednesday evening, it was clear Dorian would not hit Puerto Rico, although Ernesto Morales of the territory’s National Meteorological Service told a news conference it could cause heavy rain and possible flooding on the main island. The NHC said Dorian was blowing maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph) some 60 miles northnorthwest of San Juan, making it a Category 1 storm on the fivestep SaffirSimpson scale of intensity. BAD HISTORYTwo years ago, Puerto Rico was recovering from Hurricane Irma when Maria struck, destroying roads and bridges and leaving much of the Caribbean island without electricity for months. The U.S. response to Maria became highly politicized as the Trump administration was criticized as being slow to recognize the extent of the devastation and in providing disaster relief. Trump later disputed Puerto Rico’s official death toll. Hogan Gidley, a White House deputy press secretary, accused Puerto Rican authorities on Wednesday of misusing taxpayer funds in the 2017 hurricanes. “The money we sent down there, we now know, several on the ground have been indicted for misusing that money, giving it to politicians as bonuses, watching that food rot in the ports, the water went bad,” he told reporters. Puerto Rican public schools will be closed again on Thursday and public workers have been instructed to stay home. Slideshow ( 16 images )Earlier this week, Democrats in the U.S. Congress criticized Trump for shifting $271 million earmarked for disaster aid and cyber security to pay for detention facilities and courts for migrants arriving at the U.S. Mexico border. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, described the shift as “stealing from appropriated funds. ”As Dorian moved northwest, preparations were mounting in the Bahamas, which could be hard hit. Jeffrey Simmons, the country’s acting director of the Department of Meteorology, said severe weather could strike the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Friday, and the Central and Northwest Bahamas on Saturday and Sunday. A U.S. Air Force base in Cape Canaveral, Florida, home to the largest spaceport in the United States, entered the early stages of hurricane preparations on Wednesday.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-dorian-idUSKCN1VI0RH,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico, with 3 governors in a week, considers a 4th",DÁNICA COTO,8/8/19,"A day after Puerto Rico got its third governor in less than a week following angry street protests, top officials from new leader Wanda Vázquez’s own party talked openly Thursday about their desire to see a fourth take over the position. Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, who played a key role in the successful court challenge to the swearing-in of Pedro Pierluisi as governor after Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned, publicly backed Jenniffer González — Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative in Congress — to be secretary of state, which would put her first in line to become governor if the office should be vacated again. “If she’s good over there, she would be even better here,” Schatz said after he emerged from a more than four-hour meeting with 66 party members, including senators and mayors. He said González had everyone’s support, but he added that he would not ask Vázquez to step down. “We’re not ... planning a war here against anyone,” Schatz said. Schatz, González and the president of the House of Representatives met with Vázquez privately Thursday night at the new governor’s request. “I’m not going to lobby for anything or negotiate anything,” Schatz said before the meeting, and the participants did not comment after the session. Other members of his pro-statehood New Progressive Party were more outspoken, including Rep. José Meléndez, who said that González was a consensus person and that any change in the governorship should happen quickly. “The key to breaking the bottleneck lies with Wanda Vázquez,” Meléndez said. For González to become governor, she would have to be nominated to the open secretary of state position and confirmed by both the House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Schatz’s party. Then Vázquez would have to resign, though the new governor said she did not intend to step down despite previous comments that she didn’t want the job. González said the presidents of the House and Senate called her last weekend asking if she was available to become secretary of state as a candidate of consensus, and she agreed if it would help restore credibility and stability to Puerto Rico. “It’s time that people and not politicians become the priority,” she said. She said she was not seeking Vázquez’s position, but added: “If I got that privilege, I would be a great governor ... My experience has proven results.” She said she would change all Cabinet officials and scrutinize all contracts if she became governor. González, who is chairwoman of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico, warned that the U.S. government has doubts about how the island is handling federal funds: “The specter of corruption has called into question access to those funds. ... They don’t trust Puerto Rico’s institutions or its officials.” Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Pierluisi had been placed in office unconstitutionally, resulting in Vázquez, the justice secretary, being sworn in as governor the same evening. Amid the instability, people on the economically struggling territory of 3.2 million are bracing for more turmoil. The political establishment was knocked off balance by huge street protests spawned by anger over corruption, mismanagement of funds and a leaked obscenity-laced chat in which Rosselló and several top aides disparaged women, gay people and victims of Hurricane Maria, among others. On July 10, Rosselló’s former education secretary, former Health Insurance Administration chief and three others were arrested on charges of steering federal money to unqualified, politically connected contractors. Islanders are also angry over the territory’s protracted economic woes and slow recovery from 2017’s devastating Hurricane Maria. Vázquez sought to calm the anger in a televised statement late Wednesday, saying she shares the pain of recent weeks and vowing to bring unity and stability. “We have all felt the anxiety provoked by the instability and uncertainty,” Vázquez said. “Faced with this enormous challenge and with God ahead, I take a step forward with no interest other than serving the people as I have done my whole life.” Vázquez has worked in government for more than 30 years and is the second woman to be governor. She would serve out the remainder of Rosselló’s term until elections in November 2020 — unless she doesn’t. At least some involved in the anti-Rosselló protests are calling for her ouster, too, seeing her as a continuation of the previous administration. However, there were no protests Thursday. Critics say Vázquez was not aggressive enough as justice secretary in pursuing corruption investigations involving members of her New Progressive Party and that she did not prioritize gender violence cases. She’s also been accused of ignoring investigations into alleged mismanagement of hurricane aid, and of possible ethics violations. Appointed justice secretary in January 2017, Vázquez previously worked as a district attorney for two decades at Puerto Rico’s Justice Department, handling domestic and sexual abuse cases. In 2010, she was appointed director of the Office for Women’s Rights. In her televised statement Wednesday night, Vázquez said she would work for all Puerto Ricans. “History has brought me here without any political aspirations,” she said. “I recognize that I was not chosen by the people for this position. ... But I came from those same people. I am a product of public schools. ... I know what it is to come from nothing. I know what hard work is.”",https://apnews.com/ba57fa57a0e94bc092826c228de897f2,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico gets another governor after supreme court clears the way,Luis Valentin Ortiz,8/7/19,"Puerto Rico got its third governor in less than a week on Wednesday just hours after the bankrupt U.S. territory’s supreme court ruled that Pedro Pierluisi’s assumption of the office was unconstitutional and ordered him to leave. New Puerto Rico governor sworn in; 3rd in a week New Puerto Rico governor sworn in; 3rd in a week00:59The island’s justice secretary, Wanda Vazquez, was sworn in as governor at the supreme court in San Juan. A unanimous decision by the ninemember high court nullified Pierluisi’s governorship based on the fact his earlier appointment as secretary of state and next in line for governor had not been confirmed by both chambers of the legislature. Vazquez last week initially voiced reluctance to take over the island’s top government post after being targeted by protesters for alleged corruption and being too close to disgraced Governor Ricardo Rossello, who left office last Friday. In a statement after becoming governor, Vazquez said: “I will continue to focus on putting (Puerto Rico) back on track in an orderly and peaceful way. ”The high court’s ruling followed weeks of political turmoil with Rossello resigning after of days of protests demanding he step down. Offensive chat messages between Rossello and his closest allies and federal corruption charges against two former members of his administration sparked the protests, which drew around a third of the island’s 3. 2 million people to the streets. Slideshow ( 6 images )More political changes could be coming as newspaper El Nuevo Dia, citing unnamed sources, reported on Wednesday that Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress, could become the next secretary of state and eventual governor. The move has the blessing of legislative leaders, according to the report. PIERLUISI LEAVES OFFICEPierluisi, who was given until 5 p. m. local time (2100 GMT) by the court to vacate the office, said he “must step aside and support” Vazquez. “This is a time when we must all unite for Puerto Rico, leaving behind any partisan, ideological or personal agendas,” he said in a statement. After agreeing to resign, Rossello on July 31 named Pierluisi, an attorney and the island’s former congressional representative, as secretary of state and his handpicked successor. The selection of Pierluisi was controversial mainly because he formerly gave legal advice to the island’s unpopular, federally created fiscal oversight board, which filed the government’s bankruptcy in 2017. Slideshow ( 6 images )Pierluisi was sworn in as governor last Friday following confirmation of his secretary of state appointment by only the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. On Sunday, Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz filed a lawsuit claiming his chamber’s advice and consent duty under the island’s constitution was usurped and Pierluisi should be removed from office. Pierluisi had argued that under a 2005 law, his appointment did not require confirmation because the legislature was not in session at the time. But the court on Wednesday declared as unconstitutional the part of the law that allowed Pierluisi to be in a position to take over as governor without Senate confirmation. The political uncertainty comes at a critical time in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy and as it seeks billions of dollars in federal funding for healthcare and recovery efforts from devastating 2017 hurricanes. In a statement following the court ruling, Puerto Rico’s U.S. congressional representative, Gonzalez, said it is “important to restore credibility in Washington by showing that we are able to govern ourselves according to our own constitution. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1UX23L,Reuters,Neutral
Anxious wait for Puerto Rico as court mulls governorship,DÁNICA COTO,8/6/19,"Attorneys submitted arguments by a Tuesday noon deadline in what many consider the biggest decision in the 119-year history of Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court: who will be the governor of the U.S. territory mired in political and economic turmoil. After a sustained protest movement led to the resignation of the previous governor, the island’s 3.2 million people now await the final outcome of the constitutional deadlock pitting Puerto Rico’s Senate against Pedro Pierluisi, who was sworn in as governor late Friday. “We don’t have any other choice except to wait,” said Rita Miranda, a condominium administrator. “We’re in a serious economic crisis, we’re in a serious social crisis, and this is making it worse.” Puerto Rico’s nine-member Supreme Court was in summer recess when it decided to take up the lawsuit filed late Sunday by senators seeking a preliminary injunction ordering Pierluisi to immediately cease functioning as governor. If the Supreme Court finds in favor of the Senate, Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez would become governor, though she has said she doesn’t want the job. Pierluisi was named secretary of state while the legislature was out of session last week, and only the House approved his recess appointment. The lawsuit also asks the court to declare unconstitutional a 2005 law saying a secretary of state need not be approved by both the House and Senate if he or she has to step in as governor. Puerto Rico’s constitution, it notes, says a secretary of state must be approved by both chambers. It was not clear whether the Supreme Court would hold a hearing or simply issue a written opinion. There is no deadline, though legal experts expect a decision within days. A ruling will be final and cannot be appealed, with a majority of five judges required to declare a law unconstitutional. Six of the nine judges were appointed by governors from Pierluisi’s party, the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, and three by the main opposition Popular Democratic Party. The senator leading the effort against Pierluisi is in his party. In a 14-page filing, lawyers for Pierluisi accused the Senate of contributing to the island’s political instability and noted it had the opportunity to vote on Pierluisi’s nomination but did not do so. “Puerto Rico is embarking on a traumatic episode of high political tension that, unquestionably, aggravates the economic crisis that it has been going through for more than a decade, places at risk efforts to recover from the ravages of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (and) adversely affects relations with the federal government,” the filing states. As Puerto Rico awaits a decision, Pierluisi said Tuesday afternoon that he has been meeting with the director of government agencies, private sector leaders and others. “I’m going to keep working without rest,” he said as he asked for people’s patience. “We have to keep this boat afloat so it reaches a safe port.” Some Puerto Ricans were dismayed that after a mass protest movement successfully led to the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, the question of his successor now lies in the hands of a court. “It was a possible outcome, but certainly sad because for three weeks the island took to the streets in a historic, forceful way to peacefully overthrow a governor, and now this is left to a majority of nine people who are also nine people named and approved by politicians?” said Sen. Juan Dalmau of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. “That is another constitutional defect.” Dalmau submitted a bill Tuesday that would allow Puerto Rico to hold a special election if a governor were to step down, saying it’s a move to uphold democracy. Rosselló formally resigned Aug. 2 following nearly two weeks of demonstrations amid anger over corruption, mismanagement of funds and a leaked obscenity-laced chat in which he and 11 other men including government officials mocked women, gay people and victims of Hurricane Maria, among others. More than two dozen officials resigned in the wake of the chat, including former Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marín. Puerto Ricans have already protested against Vázquez, who would take over if Pierluisi is removed, and vowed to take to the streets again if they aren’t satisfied with the court’s decision. “I hope Pierluisi gets to stay,” said Marta Sánchez, who is unemployed. “You can tell he’s a serious man who is capable of leading Puerto Rico.” Manuel Vázquez, a handyman who was walking while reading a newspaper, agreed. “He has the skills to lead the island,” he said, though he added that he is content to have the court decide. Pierluisi is a lawyer who served as Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative to the U.S. Congress from 2009 to 2017 and lost to Rosselló in the 2016 gubernatorial primary. He also served as justice secretary under Rosselló’s father, Pedro Rosselló, when he was governor. Pierluisi said he would respect the court’s ruling whatever it is, adding that he would return to private practice if the judges rule against him because he is not interested in being secretary of state. If they uphold him as governor, Pierluisi said he would work hard to gain people’s trust and travel to Washington to meet with White House officials, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as the island struggles to recover from Maria. Opponents say having Pierliusi as governor presents a serious conflict of interest. He worked for a firm that represented the federal control board overseeing the island’s finances amid a 13-year recession, and his brother-in-law is chairman of the board that Congress created to oversee the restructuring of some of the island’s more than $70 billion in public debt after Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy. In addition, critics allege he seized the governorship without following the law. A widely respected attorneys’ organization has accused Pierluisi of “hijacking” the constitution. Mario Juan, a food truck owner who took part in the protests, said he felt powerless that the issue is up to the court. “It’s already a victory that the people of Puerto Rico participated so actively,” he said, but “this will have an ending that will satisfy no one.”",https://apnews.com/6639c6b5226d4f7b96fa502cd779f601,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico's new governor faces legal challenge,Reuters Staff,8/6/19,"Puerto Rico’s newly installed governor and its Senate president faced off on Tuesday in written arguments submitted to the island’s supreme court, which will decide who is in charge of the bankrupt government. Slideshow ( 2 images )Both sides agreed that Puerto Rico is facing its biggest constitutional crisis after days of protests forced Governor Ricardo Rossello to leave office on Friday. Pedro Pierluisi, Rossello’s handpicked successor, is fighting a constitutional challenge filed by Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz over Pierluisi’s appointment as secretary of state, a position next in line to the governor. Pierluisi was sworn in as governor on Friday after the Puerto Rico House confirmed him as secretary of state, without confirmation from the Senate. On Sunday, Schatz filed a lawsuit claiming his chamber’s advice and consent duty under the island’s constitution was usurped and Pierluisi should be removed from office. It was unclear if the Supreme Court would schedule oral arguments in the case, although a ruling was widely expected to be issued soon given the political turmoil. Pierluisi’s legal brief warned that if the high court decides in favor of the Senate, “it would have a disastrous impact on Puerto Rico’s governance,” and jeopardize the island’s stability. The governor’s lawyers argued that Pierluisi was legally secretary of state even without confirmation because the legislature was not in session. GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONINGUnder normal circumstances, an appointment made during a legislative recess would be subject to a legislative vote once lawmakers reconvene for their regular session. However, the fact that Pierluisi ceased being secretary of state once he was sworn in as governor makes that requirement moot, the brief stated. The Senate president’s brief argued that both legislative chambers need to confirm a secretary of state nominee under Puerto Rico’s constitution. Puerto Rico’s Justice Secretary Wanda Vazquez, another Rossello appointee, would be next in line for governor should the court rule against Pierluisi. At a Tuesday press conference, Pierluisi assured the public that “the government continues to function. ”His assumption of office capped more than a week of political chaos after Rossello said he would resign over offensive chat messages that drew around a third of the island’s 3. 2 million people to the streets in protest as well as federal corruption charges against two former members of his administration. Pierluisi has been controversial mainly because he formerly gave legal advice to the island’s unpopular, federally created fiscal oversight board.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1UW2GJ,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor resigns as promised; successor sworn in,DÁNICA COTO,8/3/19,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló resigned Friday as promised, clearing the way for veteran politician Pedro Pierluisi to be sworn in as his replacement, a move that threw the U.S. territory into a period of fresh political uncertainty. Rosselló had promised to step down in response to weeks of popular protest over mismanagement and a series of leaked chats in which he and advisers denigrated a range of Puerto Ricans. Because of problems with the qualifications of members of Rosselló’s administration in the constitutional line of succession, it was unclear until the last minute who would become governor. Pierluisi was named secretary of state, the next in line to be governor, in a recess appointment this week. In an emailed announcement from his office, Rosselló said Pierluisi would succeed him. He was sworn in by a judge at 5 p.m., the hour Rosselló had set to leave office. Four hours later, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz tweeted that the municipality at 8 a.m. on Monday would be challenging Pierluisi’s swearing in as governor. Meanwhile, a well-respected attorneys’ organization accused Pierluisi of “hijacking” the constitution. The territory’s House of Representatives confirmed Pierluisi as secretary of state Friday, but the Senate has not yet voted on his appointment. Rosselló said confirmation by both houses was unnecessary for a recess appointment, an assertion that appeared certain to generate legal challenges. After taking the oath at his sister’s house, Pierluisi emerged at the governor’s residence to address the press and promised only to serve as governor until the Senate’s hearing on his nomination, which has been moved up to Monday. If the Senate votes no, Pierluisi said, he will step down and hand the governorship to the justice secretary, the next in line under the constitution. Nothing more was heard from Rosselló. Pierluisi said he was “fully capable and authorized to act, but the Senate will have its say.” Depending on the Senate’s action, his tenure “could be very short-lived,” he said. He did not plan to move into the governor’s mansion until after the vote. He also said he would avoid any major changes and concentrate on meeting with top government officials. The down-to-the-wire maneuvering risked political chaos and sowed bitterness and pessimism among Puerto Ricans about the fate of their island, which has been battered by years by bankruptcy and Hurricane Maria in 2017, one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history. Only days ago, there was jubilation over the success of the popular movement to force Rosselló out of office. On Friday, Puerto Ricans bemoaned the confusion that left them not knowing who would be their next governor. “People are disgusted with the government in general, not just Ricardo Rosselló, everyone,” said Janeline Avila, 24, who recently received her degree in biotechnology. Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, a member of Rosselló’s party who is seen as a possible future governor, criticized Rosselló for naming Pierluisi and appeared to hint at fighting the succession plan. “He never regretted anything,” Schatz said of Rosselló. “He did not respect the demands of the people. In fact, he mocked them, using new accomplices.” Schatz said that order and morals will prevail: “No one should lose faith.” Hundreds of protesters marched to the governor’s residence, the Fortaleza, banging pots and drums and singing the national anthem. Protesters had not been highly critical of Pierluisi before Friday but expressed disgust with the succession process and Pierluisi’s ties to the federal control board that has promoted cutbacks on the island. Bryan Carhu Castro Vega, a 21-year-old university student, said he was disappointed. “It’s obvious that the constitutional setup that we have isn’t working for the people,” he said. “None of the options is one the people chose or want or deserve.” Rosa Cifrian, a 47-year-old professor of nursing, said Pierluisi would not be a good governor “for the people.” “He’ll keep promoting policies of austerity, cutbacks, everything that the board says,” she said. By late Friday night, police warned protesters that they would fire tear gas if needed as some chanted, “Guilty of the crisis! Pierluisi! Pierluisi!” “Ideally, we would clean the entire house,” said Roxana López, a 34-year-old musician who wanted fresh faces in top government positions. The legislature, which is controlled by Pierluisi’s New Progressive Party, erupted into cheers when the House voted 26-21, with one abstention, to confirm Pierluisi as secretary of state. One constitutional amendment states that everyone in line to become governor has to be confirmed by both House and Senate, except for the secretary of state. Constitutional law professor Carlos Ramos and other legal experts questioned the validity of that amendment and believed Pierluisi must be confirmed by the House and Senate because the amendment contradicts the intent of the constitution and its statement of motives. Lawmakers and Pierluisi himself expressed concern that the continuing political uncertainty would damage Puerto Rico’s efforts to get federal funds to recover from the hurricane and confront the economic crisis. Several legislators have accused Pierluisi of a conflict of interest because he worked for a law firm that represents the control board, which has repeatedly clashed with local officials over demands for austerity measures. Pierluisi, whose brother-in-law is the board’s chairman, tried to dispel those concerns in his opening remarks. “Who better than me to advocate for our people before the board? Who better than me to facilitate the process that will force the board to leave? That is what we all want,” he said. The board was created by Congress to oversee the restructuring of more than $70 billion in public debt after Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy. Pierluisi told lawmakers he is against several austerity measures demanded by the board, including laying off public employees and eliminating a Christmas bonus. He said he supports public-private partnerships and the privatization of the island’s public power company. “The people want a change, and I don’t blame them,” he said. A key obstacle for Pierluisi has been Rivera Schatz, who wants to run for governor himself next year. Several legislators have said they prefer Rivera Schatz over Pierluisi, but the Senate leader is a powerful figure deeply associated with Puerto Rico’s political and business elite, and his elevation to the governorship could re-ignite popular outrage. Pierluisi was Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative in Congress from 2009 to 2017 and then ran against Rosselló in the 2016 primaries and lost. He also served as justice secretary under Rosselló’s father, Pedro Rosselló, when he was governor. Rosselló joined more than a dozen government officials who have resigned in the wake of an obscenity-laced chat in which they made fun of women, gay people and hurricane victims. ___ Associated Press writers Mariela Santos in San Juan and Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/san-juan-us-news-ap-top-news-puerto-rico-caribbean-8946b01f9fcf417bb0a1e23598755d9c,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico has new governor, but his stay may be short",Reuters Staff,8/2/19,"The handpicked successor to disgraced Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello was sworn in on Friday after Rossello stepped down, but lawyer Pedro Pierluisi said his term as governor might be short as the island’s Senate still had to ratify his position. Pierluisi swornin as next Puerto Rico governor: statement Pierluisi swornin as next Puerto Rico governor: statement01:17At his first news conference as leader of the bankrupt U.S. territory, Pierluisi said Puerto Rico’s Senate would meet on Wednesday to vote on whether to confirm his position as governor. Pierluisi, a lawyer who formerly advised the despised, federally created board supervising Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, was sworn in even though his appointment had not yet gone before the Senate for a vote. Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, who calls Pierluisi “the lawyer for Puerto Rico’s number one enemy,” termed the controversial move “unethical and illegal. ”“The Senate will have its say and by the end of Wednesday we’ll know whether I am ratified,” Pierluisi, who until last week was a corporate attorney for Washington law firm O’Neill & Borges, told reporters. “If I am not ratified then the second in line, the secretary of justice of Puerto Rico, will take over the governorship. ”Rossello, a 40yearold, firstterm governor, had tapped Pierluisi as secretary of state, a position that would put him first in line as successor to the governor. The island’s leading newspaper El Nuevo Dia subsequently reported that Schatz had rescheduled the session to vote on the appointment for Monday. Hundreds of people, many waving the Puerto Rican flag, chanted and rang bells outside the governor’s mansion in the historic center of San Juan, after Rossello’s resignation. Police on several occasions warned they would fire tear gas to disperse protesters, but by 9. 30 p. m. they had yet to do so or move in on demonstrators. Slideshow ( 21 images )“UNETHICAL AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR”Pierluisi’s instatement capped off a week of political chaos in Puerto Rico after Rossello said he would resign over offensive chat messages that drew around a third of the island’s 3. 2 million people to the streets in protest. The chats between Rossello and top aides took aim at female politicians, gay celebrities like Ricky Martin and poked fun at ordinary Puerto Ricans. The publication of the messages unleashed anger building for years in Puerto Rico over the island’s painful bankruptcy process, ineffective hurricane recovery efforts and corruption scandals linked to a string of past governors, including Rossello’s father. The departure of Rossello began a succession battle, with leaders of his ruling party opposing Pierluisi on grounds his work for the control board, known for targeting pensions and bonuses, posed conflicts of interest. Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives on Friday approved Pierluisi as secretary of state. Until an appointment was confirmed by both chambers, Schatz and other senators said the next in line for governor, under law, was Justice Secretary Wanda VázquezSlideshow ( 21 images )“He did not respect the wishes of the people. In fact, he mocked them using new accomplices,” Schatz said in a tweet after Rossello announced that Pierluisi would be sworn in. “The disrespect, the lying the unethical and illegal behavior went viral. ”The island’s political stability is a concern to the U.S. federal government which has allocated $42. 5 billion to hurricane recovery efforts. Investors are watching its efforts to restructure $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities from the largest ever bankruptcy in the U.S. municipal bond market. Puerto Rican law professor Julio Fontanet saw the risk of a “constitutional crisis,” which could involve the island’s supreme court, given the law, in his opinion, made clear the justice secretary should have been appointed governor. “This constitutes a completely unnecessary crisis, the fruit of the irresponsibility and immaturity of Ricardo Rossello,” Fontanet said in a television interview.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1US13R,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico set for political clash over next governor,Reuters Staff,8/1/19,"Puerto Rico’s political crisis risked deepening on Thursday as lawmakers and street protesters opposed the Washington corporate lawyer tapped to replace disgraced Governor Ricardo Rosselló. A day before Rosselló was set to resign over offensive chat messages that sparked mass protests, some members of his party vowed to reject his chosen successor, Pedro Pierluisi, largely over conflict of interest concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the streets to demand Rosselló quit after the leaked messages unleashed rage over suspected administration corruption, slow recovery from 2017’s deadly hurricanes and the U.S. territory’s bankruptcy. Rosselló called a special session of Puerto Rico’s legislature on Thursday for lawmakers to vote on Pierluisi as secretary of state, and therefore next in line to succeed him. Members of Rosselló’s New Progressive Party (PNP) said Pierluisi’s role as a lawyer for law firm O’Neill & Borges advising the federally created financial oversight board directing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy disqualified him for the job. Street protesters accused Pierluisi of serving the interests of Puerto Rico’s political elite, not the people’s, in helping establish the widelydisliked board when serving as the island’s delegate to the U.S. Congress, then representing it as a lawyer. Pierluisi released a statement saying he had “listened to the people’s messages, their demonstrations,” and he would “only answer to the people. ”The speaker of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives, Carlos Méndez said he favored Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, also of the PNP, as secretary of state over Pierluisi, citing the lawyer’s role at O’Neill & Borges. Mendez suggested Pierluisi did not have the votes in the lower house to be confirmed. But in a sign of divisions, several PNP legislators including Yashira Lebrón and Luis Perez Ortiz told newspaper El Nuevo Dia they backed Pierluisi. And Ramón Luis Rivera, PNP mayor of Puerto Rico’s secondlargest city Bayamón, threw his weight behind the 60yearold former attorney general. “It’s time to put Puerto Rico FIRST and end the uncertainty we’re engulfed in,” Rivera tweeted. “Let’s give the governor’s nominee, Pedro Pierluisi, a chance. ”The island’s legislature will convene at 2 p. m. to consider the nomination, with Pierluisi needing a majority of votes to be confirmed.

The speaker of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives, Carlos Méndez, told reporters that Pierluisi could still become governor in the event his chamber fails to vote on or confirms the nomination during a Friday session. If the House votes against Pierluisi as expected, Vázquez would become governor, Méndez said. Slideshow ( 9 images )A 2005 Puerto Rico law suggests that the secretary of state could become governor without being confirmed by the House and Senate, according to José Julián Alvarez, constitutional law professor at the University of Puerto Rico Law School, who said he believed that law to be unconstitutional. “The constitutional solution requires the secretary of state be confirmed by both houses of legislature before the governor resigns.

Puerto Rico braces for clashes over island’s next leader,DÁNICA COTO,7/31/19,"Puerto Rico’s political crisis appeared to deepen on Wednesday as the island’s outgoing governor and legislators — including those from his own party — clashed over who should be the next leader of a U.S. territory unbalanced by massive protests. The upheaval has raised fears that a government in chaos will have trouble negotiating for more federal funding for recovery from Hurricane Maria and coping with the island’s grave economic woes. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced that he had chosen Puerto Rico’s former non-voting representative to Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, as his secretary of state — a post that would put Pierluisi in line to be governor when Rosselló steps down on Friday. But he’s unlikely to be approved by legislators, several of whom proposed instead naming Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, a declared candidate for the 2020 governor’s election. Some lawmakers complained about Pierluisi’s work for a law firm that represents the federal control board that was created to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances before the territory, saddled with more than $70 billion in public debt, declared a sort of bankruptcy. Pierluisi’s brother-in-law also heads the board, which has clashed repeatedly with Rosselló and other elected officials over demands for austerity measures. “That’s a serious conflict of interest,” Rep. José Enrique Meléndez told The Associated Press. Rep. Milagros Charbonier and House of Representatives President Johnny Méndez also said they would vote against Pierluisi and urged Rosselló to instead nominate Rivera Schatz. All three legislators are members of Rosselló’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Méndez has said Pierluisi does not have the votes needed in the House of Representatives. “The situation could not be more complicated,” said Sen. José Antonio Vargas Vidot, who ran for Senate as an independent. “This is absurd, what we’re going through. We never thought something like this could happen. In an extraordinary crisis, we have to take extraordinary measures.” Sen. Eduardo Bhatia bitterly accused Rivera Schatz of trying to maneuver himself into the top job. “This attitude of (Rivera Schatz) taking the island hostage is very dangerous,” Bhatia tweeted. ”‘It’s him or no one’ is in keeping with what has been a life silencing and destroying democracy.” Rosselló has said he will resign on Friday, bowing to the demands of massive street protests by Puerto Ricans frustrated with corruption, mismanagement and an obscenity-laced chat that was leaked in which Rosselló and 11 other men made fun of women, gay people and victims of Hurricane Maria. More than a dozen officials have resigned in the wake of the chat, including former Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marín. On Wednesday, new excerpts of the chat were released by an online blog called “En Blanco y Negro con Sandra,” which released the first excerpts of the same chat earlier this month. In the newest release, the group makes fun of people including the Senate president Schatz and several journalists, while Rosselló once again calls another female politician a “whore.” The authenticity of the chat could not be immediately verified. A spokeswoman for Rosselló did not immediately return a message for comment. By law, the secretary of state would take over if the governor resigns, but if someone is not named by Friday, Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez would be next in line. She has said she doesn’t want the job, however, and has not said what she’d do if it falls to her anyway. Meanwhile, Rivera Schatz, whose spokeswoman said he was not granting interviews, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that all problems have solutions and that Puerto Rico should be focused on finding them. “We should promote unity, not discord,” he wrote. Legislators were expected to meet on Thursday to debate Pierluisi’s nomination, which must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Political analyst Annabelle Colberg Toro said Pierluisi has proven to be a conciliatory leader in the past and warned that Puerto Rico needs stability soon. “People want a return to normalcy,” she said. “We are experiencing a paralysis in which no one knows what’s going to happen next.” Pierluisi, who took a leave of absence from the law firm, said in a statement Wednesday that much work remains to be done to recover the trust of federal authorities, U.S. Congress and the people of Puerto Rico as it also struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria. “My goal is now to transform the energy shown by our people in constructive actions that help Puerto Rico go forward,” he said. “Puerto Rico is facing times never before seen and we all have to be part of the path to progress.” Pierluisi represented Puerto Rico in Congress from 2009-2017 and then ran against Rosselló in the 2016 primaries and lost. He also previously served as justice secretary under Rosselló’s father, Pedro Rosselló, when he was governor.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-us-news-latin-america-bcbdcbbb83ca45c6a95c192ada55ba63,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor taps former U.S. delegate as successor: report,Reuters Staff,7/30/19,"Puerto Rico’s embattled governor will name the island’s former representative in the U.S. Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, as his new secretary of state and next in line to succeed him when he steps down, El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign that reads ""You are finally leaving. Ricky resign. Thanks Puerto Rico for resisting"" on the street that leads to La Fortaleza, the official residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico, and where protests calling for the resignation of Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello occurred, in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico July 26, 2019. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File PhotoGovernor Ricardo Rosselló said last week he would resign on Friday in the face of mass street protests and public outrage over the release of profane chat messages and federal corruption charges against two former administration officials. Puerto Rico lower house Representative José Meléndez told the newspaper that legislators were informed of Rosselló’s decision on Tuesday afternoon by the president of the chamber, Johnny Méndez. The newspaper said an official announcement was imminent. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pierluisi did not respond to requests by phone and email for comment, while Melendez did not respond to a direct message on Twitter seeking comment. Pierluisi, a corporate lawyer who works for Washington law firm O’Neill & Borges, would have to be approved as secretary of state by the legislature of the bankrupt U.S. territory. Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives scheduled a special session for Friday to confirm Rosselló’s pick for the post. It remained to be seen whether Pierluisi, if nominated, could gain sufficient votes. Puerto Ricans want a leader to steer them out of crisis and economic recession after Rosselló’s term was marked by backtoback 2017 hurricanes that killed around 3,000 people just months after the U.S. territory filed for bankruptcy. Replacing the firstterm governor became complicated after the official in line for the top government post, Secretary of Justice Wanda Vazquez, said she did not want the position. Also vying for the position of secretary of state is Puerto Rico Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, of Rosselló’s New Progressive Party(PNP). Foremost in the minds of party leaders is whether Rosselló’s successor can help them retain the governorship when it comes up for grabs in November 2020. Pierluisi, a former Puerto Rico secretary of justice, is favored by some PNP leaders because he is not directly linked to the Rosselló administration, which has been dogged by corruption scandals. The 60yearold lawyer has told PNP leaders he would not seek reelection in 2020, keeping the door open for Schatz or Puerto Rico’s current delegate to the U.S. Congress, Jenniffer González. Pierluisi, who ran against Rosselló in the gubernatorial election in 2016, had a track record of gaining increased federal funding for Puerto Rico’s 3. 2 million people while serving in Congress. He also faced accusations in a 2016 New York Times report of possible conflicts of interest between legislation he introduced and financial consulting work by his wife, allegations they both denied.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1UP29E,Reuters,Neutral
Woman set to replace Puerto Rico’s governor doesn’t want job,DÁNICA COTO,7/29/19,"The woman who is supposed to replace Puerto Rico’s embattled governor announced Sunday that she doesn’t want the job as the U.S. territory reels from political crisis. Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez said in a Twitter post that she hopes Gov. Ricardo Rosselló will appoint a secretary of state before resigning Aug. 2 as planned. Former Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marín would have been next in line as governor, according to the U.S. territory’s constitution. But he is one of more than a dozen officials who have resigned in recent weeks since someone leaked an obscenity-laced chat in which Rosselló and close advisers insulted people including women and victims of Hurricane Maria. Rosselló on Wednesday announced that he would step down following nearly two weeks of massive protests amid anger over the chat, corruption charges against several former government officials and a 13-year recession. In the chat, the 40-year-old Democrat and son of a governor called a female politician a “whore,” referred to another as a “daughter of a bitch,” and made fun of an obese man with whom he posed in a photo. Rosselló became the first governor to resign in the modern history of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 3.2 million American citizens. He is more than halfway through his four-year term. Marín’s resignation had left Vázquez as next in line to be governor. But she said she has already told Rosselló about her wishes not to get the job, creating a chaotic scenario about who will be Puerto Rico’s next leader. If Rosselló’s choice for a secretary of state is not approved by the island’s House and Senate, Puerto Rico’s law dictates the treasury secretary would be next in line if the justice secretary doesn’t become governor. But current Treasury Secretary Francisco Parés is too young at 31 years old. The constitution dictates the person would have to be at least 35, so that would leave interim Education Secretary Eligio Hernández next in line. He replaced former education secretary Julia Keleher, who resigned in April and was arrested July 10 on federal corruption charges. She has pleaded not guilty. “This is crazy,” political expert Mario Negrón Portillo said in a phone interview on Sunday. “We have no idea what’s even going to happen tomorrow. Societies cannot live with this type of uncertainty.” Vázquez’s comments came less than an hour after Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira resigned. “There were many challenges that we had to face together as Puerto Ricans, although sometimes we differed,” he said. “The work of each one of us must continue with the welfare of our island and its people as its north.” The announcement comes a day before Puerto Ricans planned another march, this time against Vázquez, who is accused of not ordering an investigation into the alleged mismanagement of supplies for hurricane victims, among other things. Vázquez said on Friday that there is a lot of misinformation but that she cannot speak publicly about certain cases. “The vicious attacks on my personal and professional integrity continue,” she said. “The desire and agenda of some to try to undermine my credibility at this moment of transcendental importance to Puerto Rico and to destabilize the governmental order is evident.” A spokeswoman for Vázquez did not immediately return a message for comment on Sunday. Aimara Pérez, a 32-year-old drafter who participated in some of the most recent marches, said she did not want Vázquez as governor. “We’re going to keep protesting,” she said. “It’s not going to stop. If there is evidence of corruption, the people are going to push ahead without fear, and we’re going to get rid of them all.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-constitutions-ap-top-news-caribbean-latin-america-eba61c68c5024af6aa4f99b886e3a5b0,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor says he is resigning Aug. 2,DÁNICA COTO,7/25/19,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said late Wednesday that he will resign Aug. 2 after nearly two weeks of furious protests and political upheaval touched off by a leak of crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top advisers. A crowd of demonstrators outside the governor’s mansion in Old San Juan erupted into cheers and singing after his announcement on Facebook just before midnight Addressing the protests, Rosselló said, “The demands have been overwhelming and I’ve received them with highest degree of humility.” The obscenity-laced online messages involving the governor and 11 other men infuriated Puerto Ricans already frustrated with corruption, mismanagement, economic crisis and the sluggish recovery from Hurricane Maria nearly two years ago. In reaction, tens of thousands took to the streets to demand Rosselló’s resignation in Puerto Rico’s biggest demonstrations since the protests that put an end to U.S. Navy training on the island of Vieques more than 15 years ago. Rosselló, a Democrat elected in 2016, is the first governor to xxxxxx in the modern history of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of more than 3 million American citizens. Under Puerto Rico’s constitution, the secretary of state would normally assume the governorship, but since Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marín became one of more than a dozen officials to resign in the uproar over the leak, leadership of the island would fall to Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez. She would become Puerto Rico’s second female governor. In the 889 pages of conversation leaked on July 13, the chat participants mocked their constituents, including survivors of Maria, and made offensive remarks about women, with Rosselló calling one a “whore.” The men also talked about politics and government contracts, and authorities this week issued search warrants for their cellphones in an investigation into whether they illegally divulged confidential government information. Lawmakers also began exploring the possibility of impeachment. Over the weekend, Rosselló posted a video on Facebook in which he announced he would not seek re-election in 2020 or continue as head of his pro-statehood political party, but his refusal to resign further angered Puerto Ricans and led to a colossal demonstration Monday on one of the capital’s main highways. Pressure on Rosselló to step down included calls from Puerto Rico music stars Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny and Residente and a string of U.S. politicians, including members of Congress from both parties and several Democratic presidential candidates. The upheaval comes as the island tries to restructure part of $70 billion in debt and cope with a 13-year recession that has led to an exodus of nearly half a million people to the U.S. mainland in the past decade. Many Puerto Ricans are resentful over the resulting pension cuts, school closings and other austerity measures. The economic crisis is in part a result of previous administrations — including that of Rosselló’s father, Pedro — that overspent, overestimated revenue and borrowed millions as the island sank deeper into debt. In 2017, Puerto Rico filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy. Congress approved a financial package, and a federal board is overseeing the island’s finances. An MIT graduate with a doctorate in genetics, Rosselló spent much of his time as governor fighting austerity measures and seeking federal funds after Maria devastated the island in September 2017, causing thousands of deaths and more than $100 billion in damage. Nearly two years later, some 30,000 homes still have tarp roofs, power outages remain common, and Puerto Rico has received less than a third of the roughly $40 billion pledged by the U.S. government. Rosselló complained earlier this year of unfair treatment and a hostile attitude from some U.S. officials. The public’s confidence has also been rocked by a recent string of corruption arrests involving such figures as the island’s former education secretary and the one-time chief of health services. ___ Associated Press writers Mariela Santos in San Juan and Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/san-juan-latin-america-us-news-puerto-rico-ap-top-news-c867b216f4624dedbc345b2e4fb0430f,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico governor to resign, protesters warn successor: 'You're next!'",Nick Brown,7/25/19,"Puerto Ricans danced among the brightly colored houses of San Juan on Thursday after Governor Ricardo Rosselló capitulated to 12 days of protests and announced his resignation, but many in the crowd warned they would reject the person in line to succeed him. After PR gov resigns, protesters don't want successor After PR gov resigns, protesters don't want successor01:11Meanwhile, a former Puerto Rico representative to the U.S. Congress appeared as a possible successor who might be more acceptable to protesters, according to people familiar with the talks to replace the island’s governor. The first term governor told the island just before midnight that he would resign effective Aug. 2, stepping down in the face of public anger over a corruption scandal and the release of profane chat messages. The protests have drawn as many as 500,000 people onto the island capital’s streets and protesters were not enthused over Secretary of Justice Wanda Vázquez being next in line to succeed Rosselló, based on current Cabinet vacancies. One waved a sign reading “Wanda, we don’t want you either!” while another shouted, “Wanda, you’re next!”Leaders of Rosselló’s prostatehood party were scrambling on Thursday to negotiate another successor, according to three sources familiar with the talks who requested anonymity to discuss them. During Rosselló’s term as governor, Puerto Rico endured backtoback 2017 hurricanes that killed about 3,000 people just months after the U.S. territory filed for bankruptcy to restructure $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. “I’m really, really, really, really happy, but I know we need to stay right here, screaming,” Julie Rivera, 21, said after Rosselló said he would step down. She added that she believed his designated successor, 59yearold former district attorney Vázquez, was too close to the disgraced governor. Vázquez rejected charges of improper past business ties leveled in Puerto Rican media. “During our career in public service, we’ve showed that we’ve worked in a righteous and honest manner to benefit the public,” Vázquez said. Related CoveragePuerto Rico governor's likely successor may not soothe protester ire‘FROM THE OUTSIDE’Vázquez was unlikely to actually become governor, said one of the three sources, a person familiar with Rosselló’s administration. “Whoever it is, it can’t be someone in Ricky’s inner circle or close to his government,” that person said. “It has to be someone from the outside. ”That source, as well as a person familiar with Puerto Ricorelated policymaking at the federal government and Puerto Rico Representative Luis Vega Ramos, a political rival of Rosselló, said a top candidate for the job is Pedro Pierluisi, the island’s former nonvoting delegate in the U.S. Congress. Pierluisi, a member of Rosselló’s party, ran against him in the gubernatorial election in 2016, losing in a primary. He could be in position to become the commonwealth’s next governor if he is nominated and confirmed as secretary of state before Rosselló resigns. That post, currently vacant, is first in line to succeed the governor. Pierluisi, who represented the island in Washington from 201316, has made clear to party leaders he would accept the job and commit to not running for the post in 2020 elections, leaving the door open to other possible candidates, according to another source familiar with the negotiations. Vázquez spokesman Kelvin Carrasco acknowledged that a new secretary of state would take succession precedence if one were named. Slideshow ( 16 images )Representative Jenniffer González, the island’s nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress, said she believes Vázquez would be the island’s next governor. “The new governor, Wanda Vázquez, has all my support,” said González, a member of Rosselló’s New Progressive Party in Puerto Rico and affiliated with the Republican Party on the U.S. mainland. Multiple Democrats in the U.S. Congress have urged their colleagues not to allow the political turmoil to limit federal funding for the disasterrocked island or to block a plan to increase federal Medicare funding by $12 billion over four years. The recent protests were in part triggered by public outrage over the July 10 arrests of two former administration officials charged by U.S. officials with pocketing federal money. Slideshow ( 16 images )But the final straw came July 13 when Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published 889 pages of leaked chat messages between Rosselló and 11 close allies. The group made profane and sometimes menacing statements about female political opponents, gay pop singer Ricky Martin and ordinary Puerto Ricans. In a sign investors saw Rosselló’s departure as a positive, some of Puerto Rico’s defaulted general obligation bonds traded at their highest prices in three months in the U.S. Municipal Market. “This kind of helps to eliminate some of the rampant corruption that plagued the commonwealth for decades,” said Shaun Burgess, a portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors, which holds about $145 million of insured Puerto Rico bonds. But not all Puerto Ricans were delighted at Rosselló’s ouster. “He’s taking the fall for a bunch of past governors that put us in this position,” said Ricky Shub, 33. While Shub agreed that it was time for Rosselló to go, he added, “everyone here is right to do what they’re doing, but they should have done it 20 years ago. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-resignation-idUSKCN1UK0AA,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor resigns after weeks of mass protests,Nick Brown,7/24/19,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló on Wednesday said he would resign after almost two weeks of protests calling for him to step down over a scandal involving offensive chat messages and government corruption that rocked the bankrupt island. Rosselló said in a televised speech he would stay in his position until Aug. 2 when Puerto Rico Secretary of Justice Wanda Vazquez would take over as governor. The firstterm governor announced his resignation three days after he failed on Sunday to soothe critics’ concerns by vowing not to seek reelection next year and giving up the leadership of his political party. His term as governor has seen the island hit with backtoback 2017 hurricanes that killed about 3,000 people and wreaked widespread destruction just months after the U.S. territory filed for bankruptcy. Attimes violent protests have rocked San Juan and its historic colonial capital district since the July 13 release of leaked text messages between Rosselló and his closest allies, with an estimated 500,000 people attending the largest demonstration on Monday.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1UJ101,Reuters,Neutral
Cellphones sought in Puerto Rico as political crisis deepens,DÁNICA COTO,7/23/19,"A Puerto Rico judge issued search warrants for the cellphones of government officials involved in a crude online chat whose leak has set off a political crisis that threatens to bring down the U.S. territory’s governor. One of the search warrants said that government officials used the chat to transmit official and confidential information to private citizens in potential violation of ethics laws. Kelvin Carrasco, a spokesman for the island’s Justice Department, said Tuesday that the warrants were approved overnight and issued to those who had yet to turn over their phones. He did not identify the officials and would not comment further. The possibility that some of the 12 men in the chat, including former and current government officials, could face legal trouble deepened the crisis around Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. One of the men who was part of the chat, Rosselló confidant and chief of staff Ricardo Llerandi, announced his resignation Tuesday, saying he and his family have received threats. “The last few days have been extremely difficult for everyone,” he said. “At this historic crossroads, I need to put my family above everything.” Llerandi joins more than a dozen officials who have resigned since the chat was leaked, including former Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marín, Rosselló spokeswoman Dennise Pérez, ex-president of the Economic Development Bank Gerardo Portela and former chief financial officer Christian Sobrino, who also held five other positions. For the past week and a half, protesters have taken to the streets in Puerto Rico’s biggest wave of demonstrations in at least 15 years, demanding the governor step down in a furor set off by the release of an 889-page transcript showing Rosselló participating in an obscenity-laden chat with top advisers and at least one lobbyist. “If the people want him to resign, his duty as governor is to resign because we’re the ones who choose,” said Alexander Ortiz, an 18-year-old university student from Gurabo. The chat participants talked about politics and government contracts and also insulted women and mocked constituents, including victims of Hurricane Maria. Rosselló called a female politician a “whore,” referred to another as a “daughter of a bitch,” and made fun of an obese man with whom he posed in a photo. Rosselló sounded a conciliatory note in a brief statement Tuesday. “When one side speaks legitimately, the other has the responsibility to listen carefully,” he said. “The people are speaking and I have to listen. These have been moments of complete reflection and of taking decisions based on the concerns of the people of Puerto Rico and of their best interests.” Rosselló said that from now on, he will talk only about government-related matters. Chat participants who said they either met with justice officials or turned over their cellphones as requested last week include Llerandi; a former legal adviser to the governor, Alfonso Orona; and former Public Affairs Secretary Ramón Rosario. The leaked chat has intensified long-smoldering anger over government corruption and mismanagement that many blame for a 13-year recession and a severe debt crisis that has led to pension cuts and school closings. Many are also resentful over Puerto Rico’s slow recovery from Maria, which devastated the island nearly two years ago and led to thousands of deaths. As the search warrants were being approved, a small group of protesters clashed with police overnight, and a tear gas canister set a car on fire in the old colonial section of Puerto Rico’s capital where the governor’s mansion is situated. The protests have escalated to a point where many wonder how Rosselló will be able to govern. Rosselló dug his heels in late Monday, telling Fox News that he has already apologized and made amends following the leak of the chat. But many Puerto Ricans vowed to keep protesting until he steps down, no matter how long it takes. “We can endure anything,” said Francisco Javier Díaz, a 30-year-old chemical engineer from the mountain town of Corozal. “We have the power and the resilience. And the truth is, we’re fed up.” Puerto Rican track star and Olympic bronze medalist Javier Culson joined the chorus of those demanding Rosselló’s resignation. “Today, my daughter and her relatives are leaving to seek a better future in another country. Because they don’t have opportunities here,” he wrote in an Instagram post. “We all deserve peace and tranquility and political leaders with the highest values of integrity and commitment to service. ... For the good of our society and our children, pass the baton, Ricardo Rosselló.” ___ Associated Press writer Mariela Santos contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-ap-top-news-puerto-rico-us-news-latin-america-9bfd5b3caacf46f0ac3da1af240131df,AP,Neutral
"Embattled Puerto Rico governor may resign soon, media reports",Marco Bello,7/23/19,"Embattled Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello may resign on Wednesday after 11 days of protests against his administration, local media reported, but some protesters warned his resignation would not end demonstrations. ‘We are tired’ San Juan braces for more protests ‘We are tired’ San Juan braces for more protests01:33Rossello had made no announcements as of early Wednesday. His chiefofstaff resigned on Tuesday as prosecutors investigated a scandal in the administration that has fueled demands the Caribbean island’s leader step down. Some protesters said the governor’s resignation would not end the demonstrations. If he does step down his replacement would likely be Justice Secretary Wanda Vazquez, seen among protesters as sullied for her association with the governor. “The first step is he has to quit, but that’s only the beginning,” said protester Marielie Hernández, 31. Protester Zoe Alva, 32, said: “We need to clean house entirely”. “I’ll try to keep on fighting, even if I just end up feeling like I’m a crazy person screaming in the street. But that’s how I’ve felt up to now anyway”, said Alva. Protests outside the governor’s mansion started off comparatively tame on Tuesday, limited to chanting and cheering, following Monday’s police confrontations. Organizers handed our children’s books about Hurricane Maria, and thousands read aloud in unison, as a reminder of the suffering of the cataclysmic 2017 storm. The sometimesviolent demonstrations, which drew an estimated 500,000 people to the streets of San Juan on Monday, continue to rock the bankrupt U.S. territory as it struggles to recover from a hurricane two years ago that killed some 3,000 people. The publication on July 13 of chat messages in which Gov. Rosselló and aides used profane language to describe female politicians and openlygay Puerto Ricans like Ricky Martin unleashed simmering resentment over his handling of 2017’s hurricane Maria, alleged corruption in his administration and the island’s bankruptcy process. Slideshow ( 23 images )A string of Rosselló’s closest aides have stepped down over the scandal, and his chief of staff Ricardo Llerandi was the latest to hand in his resignation on Tuesday. “At this historical juncture it is up to me to put the welfare of my family beyond any other consideration,” Llerandi said in a letter. “The threats received I can tolerate as an individual, but I will never allow them to affect my home. ”Puerto Rican officials on Tuesday executed search warrants for the mobile phones of Rosselló and 11 top officials involved in the leaked Telegram message group chats. Puerto Rico’s Justice Department first requested the phones last Wednesday as part of its investigation into the chat scandal, nicknamed “Rickyleaks. ”Only Llerandi has so far said publicly he has handed in his phone. Mariana Cobian, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to say whether the governor had surrendered his mobile. The protests have united Puerto Ricans of different political parties, social backgrounds and ages. Helena Yordan, 65, is one of many Puerto Ricans living on the U.S. mainland who has returned to the island to march alongside family and friends. “I have five nephews protesting, do you think that I’m going to let them be alone,” said Yordan, as she arrived in San Juan on Tuesday from New York, where she has lived for 25 years. “It’s brought generations together. ”Puerto Ricans have found creative ways to protest, demonstrating on horseback, yoga mats and riding jet skis. On Tuesday night hundreds of cyclists pedaled into San Juan’s old city which has become the hub of daily rallies near the governor’s colonial mansion, known as “The Fortress. ”Slideshow ( 23 images )Police broke up protests in the area on Monday night by firing tear gas into the largely peaceful crowds. CALLS FOR RESIGNATIONA firstterm governor in his first elected office, the 40yearold Rosselló has resisted calls to step down as leader of the U.S. territory and its 3. 2 million residents, though he has vowed not to seek reelection in 2020. “The people are talking and I have to listen,” Rosselló said in a statement on Tuesday. He has apologized for the chats on several occasions and asked Puerto Ricans to give him another chance. The island’s leading newspaper, prominent Democratic officials and Republican President Donald Trump have all called on Rosselló to step down. The federally created board overseeing the island’s bankruptcy, disliked by many Puerto Ricans for its fiscal austerity proposals, said it had “admiration” for those taking to the streets. “Elected officials and government employees must understand and accept that their job is to serve the people of Puerto Rico, not insiders, special interests or their own political careers,” the board said in a statement on Tuesday. The protests have begun to hit the island’s economy, with tourism officials estimating five cruise ships that canceled stops in San Juan cost local shops, restaurants and other businesses some $3. 25 million in sales.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1UI0U8,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico gov will not seek reelection, but won’t resign",DÁNICA COTO,7/22/19,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Sunday evening that he will not resign in the face of public furor over an obscenity-laced leaked online chat, but he will not seek reelection or continue as head of his pro-statehood political party. Protesters said they were not satisfied by Rosselló’s concessions, and pledged to continue demonstrations that have filled the streets of Old San Juan for more than a week. “He’s stretching things out. We had hoped he’d taken the decision to resign. He’s making the people’s pain last longer,” said Emmarie Morales, a protester from southeast coastal town of Patillas. She said the governor’s decision would not end the protests. “He’s given us more strength to protest. We aren’t going to sit around watching Netflix.” In a brief video posted on Facebook, Rosselló also said he looked forward to defending himself against the process of impeachment, whose initial stages are being explored by Puerto Rico’s legislature. “In spite of everything, I recognize that apologizing isn’t enough, that only my work will help restore confidence ...,” the governor said. “Facing that scenario, I announce to you that I will not seek reelection next year.” The 889 pages of chat on the encrypted app Telegram between the governor and 11 close allies and members of his administration, all men, showed the governor and his close advisers insulting women and mocking constituents, including the victims of Hurricane Maria. Just hours after Rosselló spoke, another top official submitted his resignation from the government. “Unfortunately the events in recent weeks, including the attitudes reflected in the comments of officials and advisers of the current administration, do not match my values ??and principles,” wrote Gerardo Portela, who has been principal investment officer, president of Puerto Rico’s Economic Development Bank and executive director of the Housing Finance Authority. Since the chat leaked on July 13, hundreds of thousands of outraged Puerto Ricans have marched to Rosselló’s official residence in the largest protest movement on the island since Puerto Ricans successfully demonstrated to demand an end to U.S. Navy military training on the island of Vieques more than 15 years ago. Puerto Rico’s justice secretary, Wanda Vázquez, would assume the governor’s role under the territorial constitution’s line of succession if Rosselló should quit. The upheaval comes as the U.S. territory is struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria and trying to restructure part of $70 billion in debt amid a 13-year recession in this territory more than 3 million American citizens who do not have full representation in Congress or a vote for president. “Today, I have the great responsibility to direct my efforts, and those of my administration, to keep searching for ways and means for us, united before God, to be able to keep guiding our island,” the governor said. But anger grew across the island after his message.  A group of legislators and mayors from Rosselló’s party remained stuck inside a community center in the upscale city of Guaynabo late Sunday as protesters arrived to demand that the governor resign. The politicians had met earlier with the Rossellór, who managed to leave with his bodyguards before the others became trapped. On Monday morning, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans were expected to take over one of the island’s main highways to demand Rosselló’s resignation as legislators considered whether to take the first steps of the impeachment process. Arriving late Sunday to prepare for Monday’s march was Nicole Quintana, a 32-year-old dentist, along with her husband and their 3-month-old son. “We had to do it for him,” she said, gesturing to her son. She said they drove about two hours from the coastal town of Isabela to participate. “Finally people have said: ‘Enough is enough. This ends here.’” Pressure on Rosselló to step down has grown throughout the week as the chorus calling for his resignation grew to include Puerto Rico music superstars Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny and Residente and a string of U.S. politicians including Congress members from both parties, several Democratic presidential candidates and Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative in Congress. Rosselló was elected governor in November 2016 with nearly 50% of the vote, and he had already announced his intention to seek a second term. A graduate of MIT with a doctorate in genetics, he is the son of former Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rosselló, who flew to the island to marshal support after the chat was made public. The governor belongs to the New Progressive Party, which seeks statehood for the island, and he is also a Democrat. Most of his time has been spent seeking federal funds since Hurricane Maria devastated the island on Sept. 20, 2017, and battling austerity measures implemented by a federal control board that Congress set up to oversee the island government’s finances. The upheaval against Rosselló prompted at least four cruise ships to cancel visits to Puerto Rico, and many officials worry about the impact a resignation would have on the already fragile economy as the island rebuilds from Maria, a Category 4 storm that caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage. Another concern is the recent string of arrests involving federal corruption charges targeting Puerto Rico officials, among them two former agency heads, including former education secretary Julia Keleher. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-caribbean-impeachments-puerto-rico-c7e56b3744d94b30ade38731d3e3fea1,AP,Neutral
Police fire teargas to break up massive protests demanding Puerto Rico governor resign,Marco Bello,7/22/19,"Police in San Juan fired tear gas on Monday night to disperse thousands of protesters demanding Puerto Rico’s governor resign over offensive chat messages, the latest scandal to hit a bankrupt island struggling to recover from 2017 hurricanes. Ricky Martin, Calle 13 join antiRossello protests in PR Ricky Martin, Calle 13 join antiRossello protests in PR01:00Police moved in at around 11 p. m. to break up protesters still on the streets of San Juan’s old city following daylong demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of residents, according to tweets and videos from the scene. Governor Ricardo Rosselló on Sunday said he would not seek reelection next year and would step down as head of the New Progressive Party but the concessions failed to appease demonstrators, who called for him to immediately surrender the governorship. The island’s largest newspaper called on the firstterm governor to leave office and reported over 500,000 protesters took to the streets of San Juan. U.S. President Donald Trump also blasted the 40yearold governor, who is affiliated with the U.S. Democratic Party. “He’s a terrible governor,” Trump said at the White House on Monday, after feuding with Rosselló in 2017 over the speed and scale of the federal response to Hurricane Maria. “You have totally grossly incompetent leadership at the top of Puerto Rico,” he said. In San Juan, demonstrators dressed in black Tshirts filled the city’s largest highway and marched in the pouring rain with celebrities like Ricky Martin and Reggaeton star Daddy Yankee in the 10th day of sometimes violent protests. “In Puerto Rico we don’t follow dictators. It’s time for you to go,” a drenched Martin, 47, the target of homophobic messages in Rossello’s chats, told cheering crowds. Related CoverageTrump slams Puerto Rico leaders, says governor is 'terrible'“Despacito” singer Daddy Yankee was among protesters who headed to San Juan’s old city where they demonstrated in front of police and orange plastic barriers near the governor’s official residence, a mansion known as “The Fortress. ”San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, an opposition politician running for governor in 2020, said Rosselló had run out of time. “The country can’t put up with this anymore,” Yulin Cruz said in a video posted from protests, wearing a black Tshirt with the message “The power is in the street. ”Rosselló on Monday again asked Puerto Ricans to give him another chance. “I used words that I apologized for but I’ve also taken significant actions in the direction of helping vulnerable sectors,” Rosselló told Fox News, explaining he had made policy changes significant to women and the LGBTQ community. Those two groups were frequent targets of misogynistic and homophobic messages exchanged between Rosselló and top aides in 889 pages of online group chats published July 13 by Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism. The crass messages showed a political elite intent on maintaining power on an island where people still live under blue tarpaulins two years after hurricanes ripped roofs off their homes and killed over 3,000 people. Protests have brought together Puerto Ricans from different political parties, and nonpolitical islanders to vent anger at alleged corruption in the administration and its handling of hurricane recovery efforts.

AntiRosselló demonstrations were also held in cities across the United States such as Los Angeles, New York and Boston which have large Puerto Rican communities. Demonstrations in San Juan prompted at least two cruise ships to cancel stops in the city on Monday. MSC cruises told its MSC Seaside vessel to go to St. Maarten instead, said spokeswoman Paige Rosenthal“The safety and security of our guests and crew is our number one priority,” Rosenthal said in an email.

Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress Jenniffer González, seen as a possible candidate for governor, has also called on the governor to go. Puerto Rico House Speaker Carlos Mendez, part of Rosselló’s New Progressive Party, appointed an independent panel on Friday to investigate whether the chats warranted impeachment. The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the island’s bankruptcy as it tries to restructure some $120 billion in debt and pension obligations. It has also raised concerns among U.S. lawmakers who are weighing the island’s requests for billions of federal dollars for healthcare and work to recover from Hurricane Maria.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico/police-fire-teargas-to-break-up-massive-protests-demanding-puerto-rico-governor-resign-idUSKCN1UH0SF,Reuters,Neutral

In June, U.S. lawmakers backed legislation to boost disaster recovery efforts across the country, including in Puerto Rico. Trump initially opposed sending any more aid to the Caribbean island, but recently relented. On Monday, Trump again questioned the Puerto Rican government’s handling of any aid, saying it was “in the hands of incompetent people, and very corrupt people. ”“The money is squandered and wasted and stolen,” he told reporters. “Congress is not happy about it. ” (Reporting by Roberta Rampton Writing by Susan Heavey Editing by Jonathan Oatis)Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-trump-idINL2N24N0V9,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor refuses to resign as island braces for big protest,Andrew Hay,7/21/19,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Sunday said he would not seek reelection next year but refused to resign as the island braced for more protests by demonstrators demanding he step down over offensive chat messages. Puerto Rico governor won't seek reelection Puerto Rico governor won't seek reelection01:22A day before a planned general strike and massive street demonstrations in the bankrupt U.S. territory, Ricardo Rossello, 40, said he respected the wishes of Puerto Ricans and would not seek a second term in November 2020 elections. He also said he would resign as head of his New Progressive Party (PNP) but would remain as governor until the end of his term in January, 2021. “I know that apologizing is not enough,” Rossello said in a video posted on Facebook. “A significant sector of the population has been protesting for days. I’m aware of the dissatisfaction and discomfort they feel. Only my work will help restore the trust of these sectors. ”His comments drew outrage from many Puerto Ricans, with social media videos showing San Juan residents leaning out of apartment windows banging pots and pans in a third day of socalled “cacerolazo” protests. The July 13 publication of sexist and homophobic chat messages between Rossello and top aides unleashed simmering resentment over his handling of devastating 2017 hurricanes, alleged corruption in his administration and the island’s bankruptcy process. “’#Resign Ricky isn’t just a call for him to resign from the party, but from his seat as the top official,” tweeted Linda Michelle, an industrial engineer and Puerto Rico radio personality. “Whoever wasn’t sure about going to the march tomorrow has now made up their mind to go. ”Slideshow ( 8 images )“POWER OF THE PEOPLE”Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, as well as Democratic presidential candidates and lawmakers have called for the governor to step aside after nine days of sometimes violent protests. “Once again: Rosselló must resign,” tweeted U.S. Representative Alexandria OcasioCortez in response to his video. But Puerto Rico’s Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, who may takeover leadership of the prostatehood PNP, said Rossello’s actions “put an end to part of the controversies and trauma hitting our people. ”Puerto Rico House Speaker Carlos Mendez, also of the PNP, appointed an independent panel on Friday to investigate whether the chats warranted impeachment. “I welcome the process started by the legislative assembly, which I will confront with complete truth,” Rossello said in the video.

It has also raised concerns among U.S. lawmakers who are weighing the island’s requests for billions of federal dollars for healthcare and work to recover from Hurricane Maria, which led to nearly 3,000 deaths. Opposing Rossello are a raft of Puerto Rican celebrities ranging from singer Ricky Martin and rapper Bad Bunny to “Hamilton” creator LinManuel Miranda. Martin, a target of the governor’s chats, said he would march with protesters on Monday, when some businesses have said they will close after trade unions called a national strike. “I want to feel the power of the people,” Martin, 47, said in a Facebook video, urging legislative leaders to start the impeachment process.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1UG0QO,Reuters,Neutral
Besieged Puerto Rico governor goes quiet amid protests,MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN,7/20/19,"In the Spanish colonial fortress that serves as his official residence, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló is under siege. Motorcyclists, celebrities, horse enthusiasts and hundreds of thousands of ordinary Puerto Ricans have swarmed outside La Fortaleza (The Fort) in Old San Juan this week, demanding Rosselló resign over a series of leaked online chats insulting women, political opponents and even victims of Hurricane Maria. Rosselló, the telegenic 40-year-old son of a former governor, has dropped his normally intense rhythm of public appearances and gone into relatively long periods of near-media silence, intensifying questions about his future. For much of his 2 1/2 years in office, Rosselló has given three or four lengthy news conferences a week, comfortably fielding question after question in Spanish and English from the local and international press. And that’s on top of public appearances, one-on-one interviews and televised meetings with visiting politicians and members of his administration. But since July 11, when Rosselló cut short a family vacation in France and returned home to face the first signs of what has become an island-wide movement to oust him, the governor has made four appearances, all but one in highly controlled situations. New protests began Friday afternoon, with unionized workers organizing a march to La Fortaleza from the nearby waterfront. Horseback riders joined them with a self-declared cavalry march, while hundreds of other people came from around the city and surrounding areas.  A string of smaller events was on the agenda across the island over the weekend, followed by what many expected to be a massive protest on Monday. The chorus calling for Rosselló’s resignation was joined Friday by Puerto Rico’s non-voting member of Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez; U.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida; and New York congresswomen Nydia Velázquez and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. The crisis has even cut back Rosselló’s affable online presence. The governor normally started every day by tweeting “Good morning!” to his followers around 5 a.m. The last such bright-and-early message came on July 8. The tweets from his account have dwindled to a trickle since then, and each one is met by a flood of often-abusive responses from Puerto Ricans demanding he resign. Rosselló’s secretary of public affairs, Anthony Maceira, told reporters Friday that the governor was in La Fortaleza working on signing laws and filling posts emptied by the resignations of fellow members of the leaked chat group. The head of Rosselló’s pro-statehood political party said a meeting of its directors had been convened for coming days, although the agenda was not disclosed beyond “addressing every one of the complaints of our colleagues.” Rosselló offered a press conference on July 11 to address the arrest of two of his former department heads on federal corruption charges. He also asked the people of Puerto Rico to forgive him for a profanity-laced and at times misogynistic online chat with nine other male members of his administration, short selections of which had leaked to local media. Two days later, at least 889 pages of the chat were published by Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism, and things got much, much worse for Rosselló. In the chats on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, Rosselló calls one New York female politician of Puerto Rican background a “whore,” describes another as a “daughter of a bitch” and makes fun of an obese man he posed with in a photo. The chat also contains vulgar references to Puerto Rican star Ricky Martin’s homosexuality and a series of emojis of a raised middle finger directed at a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances. The next day, Sunday, Rosselló appeared in a San Juan church and asked the congregation for forgiveness, without informing the press. The church broadcasts its services online, however, and his remarks became public. On Monday, July 15, Rosselló gave a notably non-confrontational interview to a salsa music radio station. The governor’s spokesman said the questions had been “negotiated” between Rosselló’s press team and the station. That night, thousands swarmed Old San Juan to demand his resignation. On July 16, Rosselló held a press conference and faced aggressive questioning about the chat scandal and the corruption arrests. Later that day, an ally tweeted a photo of Rosselló embracing Wilfredo Santiago, an obese man whom the governor had mocked in one of the most infamous sections of the chat. Since then, it’s been silence. There has been a handful of tweets, press releases and statements, some saying he won’t resign but mostly about purportedly routine meetings of administration officials. His official spokespeople aren’t answering many questions, and even his whereabouts are mostly unknown. The governor’s press secretary, Dennise Pérez, announced Friday night that she was resigning because she could no longer stand the insults and personal abuse directed at her this week by fellow Puerto Ricans. Rosselló was raised in the public eye, as the youngest son of Pedro Rosselló, who served as governor from 1993 to 2001. One of Puerto Rico’s most charismatic and controversial governors, the elder Rosselló launched a string of large-scale infrastructure projects that swelled the public debt and ensuing bankruptcy that his son has inherited. Known widely as Ricky, the younger Rosselló started his political career in his father’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Trained in biomechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Michigan and Duke, he launched his campaign for governor in 2015 with little previous history of public service. Deflecting questions about whether he owed his success to his connections, Rosselló portrayed himself as an affable technocrat with solutions to Puerto Rico’s debt and crumbling infrastructure, and by less than 3% of the total votes cast defeated David Bernier of Popular Democratic Party, which advocates greater Puerto Rican autonomy from the mainland United States. Until now, Rosselló’s greatest challenge was Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that struck the Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017, destroying the island’s power and communications systems. Rosselló came under heavy criticism for mismanaging the crisis, particularly for understating the deaths from the storm. While some of his deputies were vilified, Rosselló seemed to emerge relatively unscathed, perhaps due to his friendly and non-confrontational manner with critics, opponents and journalists alike. The father of two young children, he often posts their photos online, along with images of his wife and their two rescue dogs, a Siberian Husky and a Yorkshire Terrier. Rosselló once halted a press conference to help local journalists move their equipment out of the rain. Among the greatest shocks of the leaked chats for many Puerto Ricans was the puncturing of that image of low-key charm by the misogyny of online conversations. “He was making an effort, carrying out his governor’s role,” said Jessica Castro, a 38-year-old San Juan resident attending a Friday evening protest with her family. “He was mocking everyone behind their backs, the people who believed in him. People are really disillusioned. He’s got to go.” ___ Michael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-caribbean-hurricanes-international-news-df16e37e48c8450a8a6276d2b3f72749,AP,Neutral
AT&T explores sale of its Puerto Rico business: sources,Greg Roumeliotis,7/18/19,"AT&T Inc T. N is exploring options for its business in Puerto Rico that could include a potential sale for around $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The sale process comes as AT&T, the secondlargest U.S. wireless carrier, seeks to cut the debt pile it took on to purchase Time Warner Inc for $85 billion last year. AT&T has hired a financial adviser to manage the sale process, the sources said, cautioning that it is possible no deal will materialize. AT&T’s business in Puerto Rico comprises internet, TV, landlines and business services. It has around $300 million in 12month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the sources said. Damage from Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, and a struggling economy have hampered the U.S. commonwealth’s telecoms market, according to a 2018 report by telecommunications consultancy BuddeCom. Nevertheless, AT&T’s strong market position in Puerto Rico has attracted interest in the business from other media companies and private equity firms, one of the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is private. AT&T declined to comment. AT&T has a market capitalization of around $243 billion, with longterm debt of $164 billion as of the end of March. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson has said paying down debt is a major priority for the company. AT&T has already sold its stake in U.S. entertainment streaming service Hulu for $1. 43 billion, and WarnerMedia’s Manhattan offices at Hudson Yards for about $2. 2 billion.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-divestiture-puertorico-idUSKCN1UD30O,Reuters,Neutral
More Puerto Rico protests planned as governor resists calls to resign,Reuters Staff,7/18/19,"Massive and at times violent protests in Puerto Rico showed no sign of stopping as labor unions on Thursday organized a Friday march to keep up pressure on the governor to resign, while dozens of guns were stolen in a raid on police firearms center. Tensions rise as Puerto Rico protests continue Tensions rise as Puerto Rico protests continue01:37Thousands of protesters have jammed streets in San Juan since Saturday, calling on Governor Ricardo Rossello to step down after the leak of a raft of controversial and vulgar text messages between him and his closest allies. The scandal comes on the heels of a federal probe into government corruption on the bankrupt island. The guns were stolen from a police station in the coastal city of Guayama, which was vandalized with graffiti calling for the governor to resign or face bullets, according to a Thursday police statement. The FBI was investigating, it said. The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the U.S. territory’s bankruptcy. It has also raised concerns with U.S. lawmakers who are weighing the island’s requests for billions of federal dollars for healthcare and for recovery efforts following devastating hurricanes in 2017. “Like never before, all factions of the country agree that Ricardo Rossello has to go,” Juan Cortés, president of the Central Federation of Workers, a public,and privatesector union, said in a statement. Rossello said on Thursday he continued to ask for forgiveness for what he has called “improper” but not illegal acts on his part, while affirming his commitment to remain in office. “I recognize the enormous challenge I have before me due to the recent controversies, but I firmly believe that we can restore trust and, after this painful and shameful process, achieve reconciliation,” he said in a statement. Slideshow ( 11 images )Two top officials in Rossello’s administration, who had participated in the governor’s group chat, resigned on Saturday following the release by Puerto Rico journalist group Centro de Periodismo Investigativo of 889 pages of text messages. They showed how Rossello and his closest advisers exchanged memes, comments that were derogatory, misogynistic and homophobic, as well as privileged information in a Telegram group chat. Last week, U.S. authorities announced indictments involving six people, including two former highranking Puerto Rico government officials, who were charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal Medicaid and education funds. Wednesday’s protest, the biggest so far, included singer and actor Ricky Martin and reggaeton artist Bad Bunny. Rossello acknowledged that people have the right to protest, but he chastised “a few” protesters who he said had clashed with and injured police. Citing “questionable riotcontrol practices,” U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat, on Wednesday asked the U.S. Justice Department to protect the civil rights of protesters on the island by deploying personnel to “observe and document” local police activity. “It is my belief that the federal government must employ all appropriate mechanisms to prevent and address grievances stemming from alleged abusive practices,” she said in a letter, adding she was troubled by reports that federal immigration agents will be involved in policing protests.

Puerto Rico faces tougher scrutiny over federal Medicaid funding,Karen Pierog,7/17/19,"U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday called for heightened scrutiny of Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program as the bankrupt territory seeks increased federal healthcare funding while it deals with repercussions from a government corruption scandal. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin Baez/File PhotoThe House Committee on Energy and Commerce agreed to several accountability measures linked to a $12 billion funding boost over four years for the lowincome healthcare program in Puerto Rico. A group of Republican U.S. senators, meanwhile, sought information on whether any safeguards are in place to deter misuse of the island’s federal Medicaid dollars. Last week, Angela AvilaMarrero, former executive director of Puerto Rico’s Health Insurance Administration, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and other charges related to her role in an alleged scheme to steal federal Medicaid dollars through a corrupt bidding process with private contractors. The charges were part of a 32count indictment brought by U.S. law enforcement officials against six people in a government corruption probe. The House committee adopted an amendment proposed by U.S. Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, that added provisions for federal audits and probes of contracts related to Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program, as well as a quarterly reporting requirement on how much of the money was spent. “The legislation we are moving forward with today ensures that Puerto Rico Medicaid beneficiaries get the care they need while improving transparency, accountability, and integrity of the program that will help prevent this type of fraudulent activity from happening again,” Walden said in a statement. U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and other Republican senators requested detailed information on Puerto Rico’s Medicaid funding levels and measures related to transparency and accountability from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “The recent and unfortunate allegations concerning misuse of public funds in Puerto Rico’s health system, along with an ongoing lack of transparency in the government of Puerto Rico, raises important questions as Congress once again faces decisions on federal Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico,” the senators said in a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, who has resisted calls for his resignation over government corruption and controversial leaked group text messages, said on Tuesday thathe welcomes greater federal oversight as long as it does not slow the flow of federal money to the island.

‘Chatgate’ scandal throws Puerto Rico’s governor into crisis,MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN and JOEL COLON,7/16/19,"Nearly two years ago, Hurricane María exposed the raw dysfunction of Puerto Rico, collapsing long-neglected infrastructure and leaving several thousand dead on Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s watch. Last week, two of his top former officials were arrested by the FBI on corruption charges. But the scandal that is threatening to buckle the boyish 40-year-old governor centers on a profanity-laced and at times misogynistic online chat with nine other male members of his administration in which some of the U.S. territory’s most powerful men act like a bunch of teenagers. The leak of at least 889 pages of the private chat has sunk Rosselló into the deepest crisis of his career. In the chats on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, Rosselló calls one New York female politician of Puerto Rican background a “whore,” describes another as a “daughter of a bitch” and makes fun of an obese man he posed with in a photo. The chat also contains vulgar references to Puerto Rican star Ricky Martin’s homosexuality and a series of emojis of a raised middle finger directed at a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances. For many Puerto Ricans still recovering from one of the United States’ worst-ever disasters, on the back of the island’s biggest public financial collapse, the scandal analysts and ordinary people are calling “Chatgate” or “Rickyleaks” has proven to be too much. Thousands of protesters marched in the capital for a third day Monday to call for Rosselló’s resignation. Police tried to disperse the marchers with pepper spray in front of the Fortaleza governor’s residence, which was protected by barricades. The leaders of the U.S. territory’s house and senate said they weren’t planning impeachment proceedings, but an influential association of mayors from Rosselló’s pro-statehood party said he had lost their support. Puerto Rican artists Benito A. Martínez Ocasio, known Bad Bunny, and René Pérez, known as Residente, both said on Twitter they planned to return to Puerto Rico to join the protests. Playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose production of “Hamilton” on the island is mentioned in the chats, called them “a very disturbing portrait of how this Administration operates.” Even if Rosselló survives until election day next year, it seems clear to many observers that he has been profoundly weakened and less able to deal with crises ranging from the island’s bankruptcy proceedings to its continued efforts to receive federal funding to help recovery from María. The governor repeated at a news conference on Tuesday that he has no plan to resign. “I have not committed an illegal act and I have not committed an act of corruption,” he said. “I committed some improper acts and I asked forgiveness for that.” Chatgate erupted a day after Rosselló’s former secretary of education and five other people were arrested on charges of steering federal money to unqualified, politically connected contractors. Starting Thursday, an anonymous person or people with access to the chats leaked dozens of pages of them to two local outlets. On Saturday, Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published 889 pages. In the chat group were Luis Rivera Marín, Rosselló’s secretary of state; Christian Sobrino, who held a series of important economic posts; Carlos Bermúdez, a one-time communications aide; Edwin Miranda, a communications consultant; Interior Secretary Ricardo Llerandi; Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira and Elías Sánchez, one-time representative to the board overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy. The group mentions then-New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who had criticized Democratic Party head Tom Pérez for opposing Puerto Rican statehood, with Rosselló calling her the Spanish word for “whore.” Referring to Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan who had announced her intent to run against Rosselló in 2020, the governor says, “she’s off her meds.” “Either that, or she’s a tremendous HP,” he continues, using the Spanish initials for “son/daughter of a bitch.” Federal officials said Wednesday morning that former Education Secretary Julia Keleher; former Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration head Ángela Ávila-Marrero; businessmen Fernando Scherrer-Caillet and Alberto Velázquez-Piñol, and education contractors Glenda E. Ponce-Mendoza and Mayra Ponce-Mendoza, who are sisters, were arrested by the FBI on 32 counts of fraud and related charges. The alleged fraud involves $15.5 million in federal funding between 2017 and 2019. Thirteen million was spent by the Department of Education during Keleher’s time as secretary while $2.5 million was spent by the insurance administration when Ávila was the director. Judd Deere, the deputy press secretary for President Donald Trump said Tuesday that “the unfortunate events of the past week in Puerto Rico prove the President’s concerns about mismanagement, politicization, and corruption have been valid. “We remain committed to Puerto Rico’s recovery and steadfast in protecting taxpayers and the Puerto Rico survivors from political corruption and financial abuse,” he added. Despite widespread cynicism in Puerto Rico about politicians’ corruption and self-dealing, the chat shocked residents in a way that other scandals haven’t, particularly given Rosselló’s image as a gentle, even meek family man, said Mario Negrón Portillo, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico’s school of public administration. “Everyone woke up one day and the governor was spouting vulgarities,” Negrón said. “There’s nothing worse for a politician than losing legitimacy. I think Ricardo Rosselló has lost legitimacy.” One chat member calls the head of the federal oversight board a “kitten.” Another participant jokes that a female member of the territory’s senate belonged in a whorehouse. Along with a photo of himself greeting an obese man, the governor writes “I’m still there. It’s my fourth orbit. He generates a strong gravitational pull.” Talking about a lack of forensic pathologists at a government forensic agency, Sobrino says “can’t we feed a body to the crows?” Rivera Marín, Sobrino, Bermúdez and Miranda have already resigned or been fired. Rosselló, the son of former governor Pedro Rosselló, said in a radio interview Monday that “I’m committed to keep working.” “I know some people think differently, but I’ve determined that it’s better to keep working without distraction, dealing with all the different issues that this situation has created.” The president of the commonwealth’s House of Representatives, Carlos Méndez Núñez, said Sunday night that legislators from Rosselló’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which has a majority in both houses, did not support starting impeachment proceedings against the governor. Méndez Núñez said Rosselló had been given a one-week deadline to reflect, show contrition and prove he could continue to govern. “This week he’ll meet with mayors, with legislators, and we have to give him this time,” Méndez Núñez said. “Impeachment isn’t on the table yet. But we reserve the right to evaluate if that’s merited.” ___ Weissenstein contributed from Havana.",https://apnews.com/fe97aab3b4764eef8c2126bb2850b412,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor vows to remain in office after violent protests,Reuters Staff,7/16/19,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Tuesday he will stay in office despite protests calling for his resignation that turned violent overnight. Orlando protesters call for Rossello's resignation Orlando protesters call for Rossello's resignation00:41A peaceful demonstration that drew thousands to the streets of San Juan on Monday turned hostile in the evening when protesters and police clashed, injuring 21 law enforcement agents, officials said. The unrest was cited by a cruise ship company for its decision to cancel a scheduled stop by one of its vessels in the island’s capital city. The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the U.S. commonwealth’s historic bankruptcy and as its officials seek billions of dollars in funding from the federal government for healthcare and for recovery efforts following devastating hurricanes in 2017. Protests against Rossello were sparked by leaked controversial and vulgar text messages between the governor and his closest allies and by a federal probe into government corruption on the island. The Trump administration, which has tangled with Rossello in the past, said the events “prove the president’s concerns about mismanagement, politicization, and corruption have been valid,” according to a statement by White House spokesman Judd Deere. Rossello, who took office in 2017, said he respected the right to protest peacefully and vowed to bring greater transparency and accountability to his government. “My commitment is to keep on working and to make sure that services and the transformations that we’ve embarked in Puerto Rico continue,” the governor told a news conference. He added he is in the process of replacing Christian Sobrino, the island’s chief financial officer and Rossello’s representative on Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board, and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Martin, the government’s second in command. The two men, who had participated in the governor’s group chat, resigned on Saturday following the release by Puerto Rico journalist group Centro de Periodismo Investigativo of 889 pages of text messages, showing how Rossello and his closest advisers exchanged memes, comments that were derogatory, misogynistic and homophobic, as well as privileged information in a Telegram group chat. Slideshow ( 10 images )Rossello said on Tuesday he did not commit anything that could be considered illegal or unethical in the chat, but rather “improper” acts. The protests were also sparked by U.S. authorities’ announcement of a federal indictment involving six people, including two former highranking Puerto Rico government officials, charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal Medicaid and education funds. Rossello said he welcomed greater federal oversight tied to federal dollars as long as it does not slow down the process. “That should not be a cover for delaying federal funding,” he said.

Top Puerto Rico officials resign in group chat scandal that ensnares governor,Luis Valentin Ortiz,7/13/19,"Two of Puerto Rico’s top government officials resigned on Saturday following the publication of a bombshell group chat in which Governor Ricardo Rossello and his closest allies exchanged controversial messages that have led to widespread calls for Rossello to also step down. The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the U.S. commonwealth’s historic bankruptcy and as its officials seek billions of dollars in funding from the federal government for healthcare and for recovery efforts following devastating hurricanes in 2017. It also follows a 32count federal indictment and arrests on Wednesday of six people, including two former highranking Puerto Rico government officials, who were charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal Medicaid and education funds. Two of the 12member group chat ,Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin and Christian Sobrino, the island’s chief financial officer and Rossello’s representative on Puerto Rico’s federally created fiscal oversight board ,left the government following Saturday’s release by Puerto Rico journalist group Centro de Periodismo Investigativo of 889 pages of text messages. They show how Rossello and his closest advisors, including former and current public officials, public relations operatives and the governor’s former campaign manager, exchanged memes, derogatory, misogynistic and homophobic comments, as well as jokes about journalists, politicians and activists in a Telegram group chat. The messages further include public policy discussions, sharing of confidential government information and political campaign work, despite the presence of individuals who were not public officials at the time. Calls for Rossello to resign have come from local politicians, including from the administration’s own political party, and U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees U.S. territories. Activist groups and Puerto Rican celebrities such as Ricky Martin and Bad Bunny have also called for the governor’s immediate resignation. So far Rossello, who had planned to run for a second term in the November 2020 election, has resisted the calls. “I was elected by the people and I will continue the mission that was granted to me, now more than ever,” the governor said in a statement. He added that a successor for Sobrino will be announced “within hours. ” It was unclear when a successor would be named for secretary of state, a position that is second in charge of the government, according to Puerto Rico’s Constitution. Puerto Rico filed a form of bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.

Former Puerto Rico government officials arrested in corruption probe,Luis Valentin Ortiz,7/10/19,"Two former highranking Puerto Rico government officials were among six people arrested and charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal education and Medicaid funds, U.S. law enforcement officials said on Wednesday. The six are accused of stealing federal money through various government contracts that were awarded as part of corrupt bidding processes. The arrests come as the bankrupt U.S. territory is seeking to obtain more federal money that it needs for postHurricane Maria reconstruction and for increased Medicaid funding. Puerto Rico has been in U.S. District Court since 2017 using a form of bankruptcy to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Julia Keleher, who headed Puerto Rico’s education department until April, and Angela AvilaMarrero, executive director of Health Insurance Administration, who left the job last month, used their positions to “benefit and enrich themselves through fraud and the theft of government funds,” according to the 32charge indictment relating to $15 million in federal funds. Keleher was arrested in Washington. Her attorney did not immediately reply to a request for comment. An attorney could not immediately be identified for AvilaMarrero, who was arrested in Puerto Rico. Jose Soto, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General overseeing Puerto Rico, said part of the scheme involved an agency that manages Medicaid funds, adding that his office will “make recommendations” to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. A U.S. House subcommittee is scheduled on Thursday to take up new legislation that would increase federal Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico by $12 billion over four years. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress, said in an emailed statement that the indictments pose another challenge to procuring needed funding for the island, which was hit by devastating hurricanes in 2017. She said, “things like these make the process of obtaining and disbursing funds, and of making decisions on programs, even harder at all levels. ”U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona who chairs the House National Resources Committee, which oversees U.S. territories, called on Governor Ricardo Rossello to restore credibility. “Governor Rossello has little time and much to do to restore public faith in his government, and I urge him to take a housecleaning approach as quickly and thoroughly as possible,” Grijalva said in a statement. Rossello, who law enforcement officials said was not implicated in the indictment, issued a statement that his administration “will not tolerate corruption” and pledged to cooperate with law enforcement.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1U52SB,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board sues governor over pension law,Luis Valentin Ortiz,7/3/19,"Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board sued the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s governor and fiscal agency on Wednesday over a new law that transfers municipal pension and health insurance costs to the government. Slideshow ( 2 images )The litigation marked the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle between the board and the government over spending priorities. The board said it is seeking to invalidate the measure known as Law 29 because it does not comply with its certified fiscal plan that calls for municipalities to continue to cover those costs. It said this violates the 2016 federal PROMESA Act, which established the board and a debt restructuring process for Puerto Rico. “Law 29 will undermine the government’s ability to pay pensions to all retirees whenever Puerto Rico’s government faces fiscal distress,” said Oversight Board Chairman José Carrión in a statement. “Exempting municipalities and putting that burden on the commonwealth sets a terrible precedent that other employers may try to use in the future,” he added. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Puerto Rico as part of the island’s ongoing bankruptcy case to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Law 29, which was enacted in May by Governor Ricardo Rossello, will add $311 million in additional government spending in fiscal 2020 and $1. 7 billion through fiscal 2024, according to the lawsuit. Christian Sobrino Vega, Puerto Rico’s chief financial officer, said the government’s legal team will review the lawsuit. “The actions of the Government of Puerto Rico during this administration seek fiscal responsibility while also procuring the necessary resources for providing essential services to the citizenry. This includes and requires safeguarding the operation and finances of the municipalities,” he said in a statement. Puerto Rico lawmakers passed a fiscal 2020 budget that includes funding for local pensions and health insurance costs to aid cashstrapped municipalities despite warnings from the board that Law 29 is inconsistent with the fiscal plan. On Monday, the board imposed its own budget on the government that does not include those costs. After running out of pension assets, Puerto Rico’s government turned to a “payasyougo” system in which all public pension costs are paid through its general fund annually. The central government then gets reimbursed by public corporations, agencies and municipalities for payments made on behalf their employees. Last year, Rossello sued the board over its imposed budget, arguing the panel exceeded its powers. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing the island’s bankruptcy, ruled in August that the board has broad and exclusive authority over Puerto Rico’s budget under the PROMESA Act, although it cannot demand changes in law.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1TY2ZI,Reuters,Neutral
Lawsuit targets alleged Puerto Rico power company corruption,DÁNICA COTO,6/30/19,"A federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances filed a lawsuit on Sunday to recover what it called massive fraudulent payments made by the island’s power company to fuel suppliers for more than a decade. The lawsuit was filed against fuel companies Trafigura and Vitol for allegedly supplying low-grade oil as well as three laboratories accused of receiving money for falsifying tests on oil bought by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority. The board said billions of dollars of alleged overpayments from 2002 to 2015 led in part to the power company’s insolvency and caused it to slide deeper into debt, noting that fuel oil purchases are its single largest expense. “Customers and creditors were harmed,” said board member David Skeel. The power company is required by contract and environmental regulation to only buy high-grade fuel oil, the board said. Power company spokeswoman Edith Seda said no one was immediately available for comment. Trafigura and Vitol did not immediately return messages for comment. The laboratories were identified as Texas-based Inspectorate America Corp. and Puerto Rico-based Saybolt, Altol Chemical Environmental Laboratory Inc. and Carlos R. Méndez & Associates. An employee at Inspectorate America Corp. said no one was immediately available for comment, and no one could be immediately reached at the other three companies. In an earlier, separate class-action suit that was automatically stayed because Puerto Rico’s power company is trying to restructure its debt, plaintiffs accuse the company of accepting kickbacks and passing along the alleged overpayments to customers already facing high power bills amide a deepening recession. The company has denied any wrongdoing in that case. The board’s lawsuit notes that the power company used debt to cover operating revenue shortfalls by 2011, and that it was overburdened with debt by 2014. Sunday’s lawsuit was filed a year after Puerto Rico’s governor signed a historic bill to privatize a power company that is more than $9 billion in debt and operating an unstable electric grid devastated nearly two years ago by Hurricane Maria. The government plans to sell its power plants and create public-private partnerships for the transmission and distribution of power.",https://apnews.com/a78c81f870bd4a4cb0022537fe0a5f60,AP,Neutral
U.S. judge limits bondholders' claim on Puerto Rico pension system assets,Reuters Staff,6/27/19,"A U.S. District Court judge on Thursday ruled that bondholders’ claim on the assets of Puerto Rico’s public employee pension system ended when the system filed for bankruptcy in May 2017. The ruling is a setback for owners of nearly $3 billion of bonds sold by the system after a U.S. Appeals Court in January determined they had a legally enforceable claim as of December 2015 on assets pledged by the pension fund to pay off the debt. But Judge Laura Taylor Swain decided the claim on employer contributions to the Employees Retirement System did not extend into bankruptcy. The judge is hearing cases involving the U.S. Commonwealth’s attempt to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. After completing restructurings for Puerto Rico’s sales taxbacked debt and its Government Development Bank, the island’s federally created financial oversight board is addressing core government debt. The board recently announced an agreement with a courtappointed committee representing more than 167,000 retirees that includes reductions in certain pension payments. Robert Gordon, a partner at Jenner & Block and the retiree committee’s lead counsel, called Swain’s latest ruling “very important and appropriate. ”“In combination with the plan support agreement recently reached by the Official Retiree Committee with the oversight board and other plan support agreements recently made, it appears that momentum is developing toward a plan of adjustment for Puerto Rico,” he said in a statement. The board has said a plan was coming soon even though Puerto Rico’s government opposes pension cuts it includes and only a small percentage of bondholders have agreed to a restructuring of general obligation and Public Buildings Authority debt. Prior to its bankruptcy filing, Puerto Rico’s pension system liquidated almost all of its cash assets and the government moved to a payasyougo system in which pension benefits are paid out of the island’s general fund.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1TS3BE,Reuters,Neutral
New corruption allegations hit Puerto Rico’s government,DÁNICA COTO,6/25/19,"A top Puerto Rico official said Tuesday that he appeared before a federal grand jury investigating a former government adviser in the latest corruption allegation to hit the U.S. territory this week. Chief of Staff Ricardo Llerandi said he answered questions and submitted documents related to Alberto Velázquez, who was a consultant for a company that oversaw the island’s Health Insurance Administration. Llerandi said that the documents aren’t related to his current position and he isn’t being investigated. Hours later, he announced that he accepted the resignation of Ángela Ávila, executive director of the insurance administration. No other details were provided. The announcement comes a day after Gov. Ricardo Rosselló asked Puerto Rico’s Treasury Secretary Raúl Maldonado to resign following comments he made to local radio station WKAQ. Maldonado said there was an “institutional mafia” in the agency he oversaw and that people tried to bribe him several times. Maldonado was also Puerto Rico’s chief financial officer and director of the Office of Budget and Management. Rosselló said he wasn’t firing Maldonado because of his comments, but because he lost confidence in him, adding the allegations were serious and he has ordered an investigation. “Maldonado must present all evidence he has to justice officials,” Rosselló said. Maldonado took over the Treasury Department in January, when former Secretary Teresita Fuentes resigned after saying there were irregularities within the agency. Meanwhile, Maldonado’s son took to social media this week to accuse Rosselló of corruption and of altering an audit ordered by his father. The audit looked into a foundation with ties to Rosselló’s wife and ultimately found no wrongdoing involving alleged mishandling of supplies meant for Hurricane Maria survivors. Rosselló issued a statement on Tuesday rejecting accusations and noting that his wife was only a spokeswoman for the foundation and did not have an administrative role. “Any insinuation about this is absurd, lacks coherence and is unforgivable slander,” Rosselló said. Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez ordered Maldonado to meet with prosecutors on Friday and present evidence to back up his claims of alleged bribery. She said his son was ordered to appear next week. The FBI said Tuesday that it could not confirm or deny potential or ongoing investigations. Last month, the FBI arrested the executive director of Puerto Rico’s Senate Office of Government Affairs and two legislative advisers. They are accused of creating an alleged billing scheme for professional services never rendered. The upheaval comes as Puerto Rico prepares to submit its budget for the upcoming fiscal year as it fights austerity measures sought by a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances and the restructuring of some of its more than $70 billion public debt load amid a 13-year recession.",https://apnews.com/article/eb0a5f1fdbac48b4a6047783b52abda5,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico board asks court for more time on members' appointments,Reuters Staff,6/18/19,"Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board asked a federal appeals court on Tuesday to extend a July 15 deadline for its members to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, citing concerns that missing it could harm an ongoing restructuring of the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s debt. The action followed an announcement by a U.S. Senate committee that the confirmation process will not begin for several weeks. “Without such an extension, the oversight board would be unable to carry out its responsibilities on July 15, which will throw the debt restructuring process into chaos and threaten irreparable damage to the Puerto Rican economy,” the board said in a statement. The board, which is overseeing the restructuring of about $120 billion of Puerto Rico debt and pension obligation through a form of bankruptcy, asked the Bostonbased First Circuit Court of Appeals to extend the deadline pending a U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether to review the matter. The appeals court in May extended a May 16 deadline for the board’s seven members to be reappointed or replaced to July 15. In February, in a case brought by Puerto Rico creditors, the court ruled that the members’ 2016 appointments violated the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause because they were not confirmed by the Senate. While the appeals court declined to void actions taken by the board, the ruling cast uncertainty around the board as it continued efforts to restructure Puerto Rico’s debt and pension obligations under a form of bankruptcy filed for the U.S. commonwealth in 2017. The White House on Tuesday officially sent nominations for the board’s current members to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which said it expects to receive paperwork for the nominees “within several weeks and will announce a hearing for (the nominations) shortly thereafter. ”The nominations cover only the remainder of the members’ terms, which all end on Aug. 30. A spokesman for the board said the members would continue serving until they are formally replaced. The Supreme Court could announce as soon as Monday whether it will review the First Circuit’s appointments ruling. After completing debt restructurings for Puerto Rico’s sales taxbacked debt and Government Development Bank, the board has said it will soon unveil a core government debt adjustment plan that includes outstanding general obligation bonds and unfunded pension liabilities.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1TJ2WR,Reuters,Neutral
Nike cancels Puerto Rico-homage sneaker with Panama design,No Author,5/21/19,"Nike said Tuesday it won’t release a version of its Air Force 1 shoe meant to celebrate Puerto Rico, after an indigenous group in Panama objected to one of its traditional designs being used on the sneaker. The company said in a statement: “We apologize for the inaccurate representation of the design origin for the Nike Air Force 1 ‘Puerto Rico’ 2019. As a result, this product will no longer be available.” The shoe was to have been released in June. The Guna people, one of seven indigenous groups in Panama, live mainly on the Caribbean coast and have traditionally used the swirling, multicolored “Mola” design. The Gunas said in a statement that the company had not asked permission to use the design. Panamanian law recognizes indigenous groups’ rights to their intellectual property. “We are not against our ‘mola’ being commercialized. What we oppose is it being done without consulting us first,” said Belisario López, the traditional leader of the Guna Yala community. López said the design represents “Mother Earth, because the design is based on everything that is nature.” But, he noted the design “is a dress (style) exclusively for women.”",https://apnews.com/6ed9f6100b3546e1b5115c9efde01772,AP,Neutral
Official over Puerto Rico police reform resigns in protest,DÁNICA COTO,5/14/19,"A retired Army officer overseeing a federally mandated reform of Puerto Rico’s police department resigned on Tuesday, saying he’s lost trust in the process. Arnaldo Claudio said in a phone interview that the U.S. Department of Justice and the federal court are not taking sufficient action to end wrongdoing and that the money meant to overhaul the large department is being misspent. “I don’t want to be associated with such a system,” he said. “There is something called resignation and something called ethical and moral values.” Claudio was appointed nearly five years ago to oversee a multimillion-dollar, 10-year reform of an agency accused of corruption, illegal killings and civil rights violations. The reform called for numerous changes, including the creation of new disciplinary procedures, a use-of-force policy and additional training for officers before they’re assigned to the streets. Since being appointed, Claudio said he has submitted eight reports detailing illegal use of force, illegal transfers and violations of constitutional civil rights, among other things, but has not received support from federal officials. Claudio also said that between $5 million and $7 million is being spent on private lawyers involved in the process instead of going to reforming Puerto Rico’s police department. The resignation surprised many, including Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez, who said in a statement that Claudio worked well with her agency and collaborated for the benefit of the island’s police department. His resignation comes as Puerto Rico’s governor has been clashing with a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances over how money should be spent amid a 12-year economic recession. William Ramírez, executive director of the ACLU in Puerto Rico, said in a phone interview that Claudio’s departure is a blow to reform efforts. “He showed us that he had genuine interest,” said Ramírez, who initially opposed Claudio’s appointment because of his military background. “It’s very unfortunate that he resigned. It’s definitely a setback because it’s taken a lot of time to win the confidence of the people.” He said that he has not seen any changes in the police department after Claudio submitted those reports. “Puerto Rico’s police still has a lot of work to do to comply with the reform,” Ramírez said, adding that at least seven people on the island of 3.1 million have been killed by officers so far this year, including an epileptic patient who authorities say was wielding a machete. A spokeswoman for Puerto Rico’s police department referred calls for comment to Karixia Ortiz, spokeswoman for the island’s Department of Public Safety. She did not immediately return a message for comment. Meanwhile, Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira said in a statement that the government is committed to protecting citizens. Ramírez, however, said no one is investigating such shootings. “In Puerto Rico, there is no independent monitoring of the police department,” he said. “That’s a problem.” More than 100 law enforcement officials across Puerto Rico have been charged with corruption in the past decade.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-police-caribbean-puerto-rico-civil-rights-violations-9a42707e44c1493aa4fa4c2167249f65,AP,Neutral
Disaster bill clears U.S. House amid feud over Puerto Rico aid,Susan Cornwell,5/10/19,"The U.S. House of Representatives approved a multibilliondollar disaster relief bill on Friday, continuing a quarrel with President Donald Trump and other Republicans who oppose providing more aid to Puerto Rico. Plastic tarps over damaged roofs are seen on houses a year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 18, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaSenate Republicans made a new offer this week with more money for the island U.S. territory that was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, but a Democratic aide said it fell short of what Democrats already have included in House bills and have been pushing for in talks. No details were provided. So the Democraticmajority House voted 257150 to pass a $17. 2 billion measure to help Americans, including Puerto Ricans, rebound from a string of natural disasters from wildfires to floods and hurricanes ,knowing that Republicans, who run the Senate, do not approve and Trump won’t sign it into law. The bill included $600 million for a nutrition program for Puerto Rico, as well as other pots of money that the territory would be eligible for, such as water infrastructure grants. Trump tweeted his opposition Thursday night. “House Republicans should not vote for the BAD DEMOCRAT Disaster Supplemental Bill which hurts our States, Farmers & Border Security,” he wrote on Twitter. “We want to do much better than this. All sides keep working and send a good BILL for immediate signing!” However, 34 House Republicans defied the president and voted with the Democrats for passage. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy opposed the House bill, but struck a note of optimism. He said that he had spoken with Trump, Senate leaders and House Democratic leaders, and “I believe we can solve this all by next week. ”McCarthy confirmed that Republicans had made an offer on disaster relief to senior Democrats on Thursday, but did not give details. Disaster relief has been stalled since April amid disagreements over Puerto Rico. Trump, who accuses Puerto Rico of aid mismanagement, argues they should not get any more money. The president this week repeated his claim that Puerto Rico had received $91 billion since the hurricane struck in 2017, an assertion that Democrats denounce as false. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that Puerto Rico has received a little over $11 billion. Trump appeared to be using a White House fact sheet number that estimated $91 billion could go to Puerto Rico over time. The House passed a similar bill in January with $14. 2 billion in aid, but it was not taken up by the Senate.

Report: Puerto Rico saw 44% drop in students since ’06,DÁNICA COTO,5/7/19,"Public and private school enrollment in Puerto Rico has dropped 44% since 2006, researchers announced Tuesday, leading to the closure of 265 schools and raising concerns that children will start to drop out. Investigators with the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York’s Hunter College said that a disproportionate number of school closures - 65% - have come in rural areas on the economically struggling U.S. territory, compared with 35% in urban areas. The center’s director, Edwin Meléndez said the changes have led to cuts in school bus service and reduced access to primary school education. “They have to travel longer distances. Many live with grandparents or single mothers where transportation isn’t available,” he said. “They’re going to have high desertion rates.” The enrollment drop is mostly a result of a 12-year recession that has sparked an exodus of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland in search of jobs and a more affordable cost of living. The exodus accelerated after Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit in September 2017 and is blamed for an estimated 4% loss of the U.S. territory’s population. Meléndez said schools often serve as an anchor for families, with education being a top factor in the debate of whether to leave the island of 3.1 million people. “That’s one of the reasons families who have emigrated are not coming back,” he said of the closures. “The exodus and population loss has not ended.” Meléndez said most of the closures involve primary and middle schools, noting that the number of children younger than 5 has decreased 42 percent since 2006. But he said he worries about young children who remain in Puerto Rico and the increased difficulties they face in finding a school near their home. A separate study by the U.S. nonprofit Lumina Foundation found that Puerto Rico college enrollment decreased by 7% over the past three years, but that degree completion is higher on the island than in the U.S. mainland. It is the first time the study includes statistics on Puerto Rico. Courtney Brown, Lumina’s vice president of strategic impact, said Puerto Rico’s government also should start thinking about its adult population and how it can contribute to the economy. “They have talent, too,” she said. “Puerto Rico has a number of challenges ... (The) human capital issue is just as urgent.” The reports were released a month after Puerto Rico education secretary Julia Keleher resigned amid criticism of school closures and other concerns. A new interim secretary has promised to create charter schools and vouchers as ordered by the governor as part of a plan to overhaul the island’s public education system.",https://apnews.com/d1d75b4bb1704bd2afb2e6047e3b0a3e,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board sues over bond payment pledge,Karen Pierog,5/3/19,"Puerto Rico’s longstanding pledge to pay off about $13 billion of outstanding general obligation (GO) bonds is just an unsecured promise, according to the latest lawsuits brought by the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s federally created financial oversight board. Its action capped off a barrage of litigation this week that unsettled the $3. 8 trillion U.S. municipal market, where states, cities, schools and other issuers sell debt. Complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico late on Thursday against GO bondholders, including mutual funds and other institutional and individual investors who contend they have a lien on the island government’s revenue. The board countered that Puerto Rico’s pledge of its “good faith, credit and taxing power” is “nothing more than a promise to pay” and that promise is not secured by any of the government’s property. Even if a lien existed under local law, it would be avoidable under bankruptcy law, according to the lawsuits. Defendants included BlackRock Financial Management, whose representative declined to comment. The lawsuits were filed ahead of the second anniversary of Puerto Rico’s May 3, 2017, bankruptcy, which seeks to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. They followed other litigation this week against hundreds of government vendors, as well as Wall street banks and firms that participated in the island’s bond sales. The board also went after certain GO bondholders in an attempt to recoup past debt service payments. James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors and a municipal bankruptcy expert, called the board’s attack against liens a probable negotiating ploy. “Clearly, there’s not a lot alleged as far as facts in there,” he said on Friday. While detailing “significant risks” for investors, the prospectus for $3. 5 billion of GO bonds Puerto Rico sold in 2014 pointed to the commonwealth’s “irrevocable pledge” of its credit and taxing power to pay off the debt. It also stated that the bonds have a “first claim on available commonwealth resources” under Puerto Rico’s constitution. In January, the oversight board filed a motion seeking to invalidate more than $6 billion of GO bonds ,the 2014 issue and bonds sold in 2012 ,on the basis they were issued in violation of constitutional debt limits. Analysts said the litigation involving GO bonds could harm the municipal market and make it harder for the board to meet its mandate under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act to restore Puerto Rico’s capital markets access. “It will cast a dark cloud over any other fullfaith general obligation credit in the future if they get away with it,” said Richard Ciccarone, the head of Merritt Research Services. Axios Advisors told clients: “Even if the board is successful in these efforts, which we seriously doubt, the commonwealth will be paying the price later on when it tries to access the capital markets again. ” (Reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago, additional reporting by Luis Valentin Ortiz in San Juan Editing by Matthew Lewis)Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-idUSL1N22F170,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico announces deal to restructure power authority debt,Luis Valentin Ortiz,5/3/19,"Puerto Rico’s power utility struck a deal with a group of creditors that seeks to allow the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth to restructure more than $8 billion of bonds, according to an announcement by government authorities on Friday. A group of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bondholders, bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, along with the island’s government and federally created financial oversight board, reached a restructuring support agreement that would reduce the utility’s debt by up to 32. 5 percent. The move paves the way for a plan of adjustment for PREPA, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in July 2017 after a previous restructuring deal fell apart. The latest agreement, which requires support from at least 67 percent of voting bondholders to materialize, would shed about $3 billion in debt service payments over the next decade. The deal also requires the approval of a U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases, as well as legislative action. Under the agreement, investors will exchange their PREPA bonds at 67. 5 cents on the dollar for new Tranche A bonds and 10 cents on the dollar for new Tranche B bonds. The latter would be contingent on full payment of Tranche A bonds and future electricity demand on the island. PREPA will pay off the new bonds through a special charge levied on its customers. The new charge starts at approximately 1 cent per kilowatt hour prior to the deal’s closing, increasing to some 2. 768 cents per kilowatt hour upon closing and gradually increasing to approximately 4. 552 cents per kilowatt hour during the expected 40year lifespan of the bonds. The deal still lacks the support of other PREPA creditors, most notably bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. A spokesman for National declined to comment. National Public Finance filed an objection last month when a deal in principle was announced, saying that “until very recently” it was excluded from negotiations even though it is PREPA’s largest creditor. National has also asked the court to appoint a receiver for PREPA, support among other creditor remains unclear following Friday’s announcement. According to government and board officials, the privatization of PREPA is under way, with transmission and distribution contracts with private companies expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2020. “Now with this agreement we take a monumental step to provide for the restructuring of the debts and obligations of PREPA and finally conclude the bankruptcy process,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement. If approved in federal court, PREPA’s restructuring would mark the third major deal in Puerto Rico’s efforts to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Deals involving the island’s sales taxbacked bonds and Government Development Bank have been approved by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain. PREPA’s financial and operational problems were compounded by Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island in September 2017, decimating an electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-prepa-idUSKCN1SA026,Reuters,Neutral

"Puerto Rico board hits Wall Street banks, bondholders with lawsuits",Luis Valentin Ortiz,5/2/19,"Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board said on Thursday it sued some owners of potentially invalid bonds of the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth, as well as Wall Street banks and firms that participated in various debt issuances in an effort to recoup more than $1 billion. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin BaezThe litigation, which was in the works since last month, follows more than 230 complaints the board filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico earlier this week against private companies, individuals and service providers that received about $4. 2 billion in payments from the island’s government as far back as four years before its May 3, 2017, bankruptcy filing. The board, which had only two years from that date under a statute of limitations to file certain claims, was denied an extension last week by a federal judge hearing Puerto Rico’s cases aimed at restructuring about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. At issue is more than $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 that the board contends exceeded a debt limit in Puerto Rico’s constitution. The validity of some bonds issued by the island’s Public Buildings Authority, as well as pension bonds, is also being questioned. Judge Laura Taylor Swain has yet to rule in the matter. The lawsuits contend that bond underwriters, attorneys and advisers “aided and abetted” Puerto Rico in failing to meet its fiduciary duties, as it issued debt unlawfully and while being “clearly insolvent. ” In participating in these transactions, the defendants acted “for their own profit and unjust enrichment,” according to the litigation. Defendants include many of Wall Street’s biggest investment banks, as well as law firm Sidley Austin. Linton Childs, Sidley Austin’s general counsel, said, “We believe that putative claims asserted against the firm are both untimely and entirely without merit. ”The board argued that the proceeds and profits made by the defendants “are recoverable as fraudulent transfers” and that the court should award damages. In the case of $3. 5 billion of junkrated GO bonds sold in 2014, the board alleged that underwriters and advisers “knew or should have known” that the transaction ran afoul of the commonwealth’s constitutional debt limit. It also contended underwriters bought these bonds at discount, allowing them to “reap large profits” from the resale of the bonds to investors. In addition, the board sued individual investors and banks that owned at least $2. 5 million of the bonds between May 2013 and May 2017 in an effort to recoup debt service payments they received. “The oversight board did not take the decision to claw back payments lightly,” said David Skeel, a member of the board’s Special Claims Committee, in a statement. “However, Puerto Rico’s taxpayers should not have to shoulder payments the government made to big investors that should never have been made in the first place. ”The board said while it is “sympathetic” to bondholders, Puerto Rican law limits government borrowing authority to avoid “sacrificing services necessary to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of Puerto Rico and its people. ”Various investment banks were also sued as parties to interest rate swap agreements with the commonwealth that earned them almost $400 million in termination fees. According to the board, these institutions “knew that the underlying bonds tied to these swap transactions carried substantial risk,” which would result in an unfavorable outcome to the commonwealth. “Despite this knowledge, the swap counterparty defendants continued to recommend and cause Puerto Rico issuers to enter into additional swap transactions on bonds they themselves underwrote,” the lawsuit stated.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-lawsuits-idUSKCN1S81YL,Reuters,Neutral
New data shows 4% drop in Puerto Rico population since Maria,No Author,4/18/19,"New Census Bureau data shows Puerto Rico lost nearly 4% of its population after Hurricane Maria — the greatest population drop in the recorded history of the island, according to one demographer. Data released Thursday shows the U.S. territory’s population dropped by 129,848 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The hurricane struck two months into that period, in September 2017. The population loss was due to both deaths and people moving away, although emigration accounted for most of the drop. The heaviest population drops occurred in metropolitan areas such as the capital of San Juan, the city of Ponce and surrounding areas. “It’s the largest population drop seen in a single year ever registered in Puerto Rico,” demographer Raúl Figueroa said. The census numbers show there were 6,449 more deaths than births during the 12 months in question, a normal figure, even though there were several thousand more deaths than normal in the months immediately following the hurricane. Many of those excess deaths following the hurricane were of sick and elderly people who would have died sometime in the year in the question, Figueroa said. Deaths for the year may have been concentrated right after the storm due to the lack of electricity, services and fresh water. He said he thinks emigration slowed in 2019 and the population has begun to slowly recover. Many Puerto Ricans left for Florida and New York, home to communities of people from the territory. Sister Carmen Negrón of the Society of the Sacred Heart sells handmade rosaries and religious icons in a narrow passage in the Plaza del Mercado in the Rio Piedras area of San Juan. She said she has noticed a drop in sales due to what seem to be fewer people in the area. “This area’s been shrinking,” Negron said. “Sales are down.” The San Juan area lost 81,087 people, a 3.9% drop, in the 12 months covered by the Census Bureau report. Paseo de Diego, the central thoroughfare in Rio Piedras, was filled years ago with stores that are closed and empty today. “You see fewer people around, fewer young people,” said Wilfredo Montañez, who was sitting on a bench in the plaza. Magaly Robles has been selling roast potatoes outside the plaza for 15 years. A native of the Dominican Republic, she said that because she has a job, she has no intention of moving again. “Lots of people have left since Maria,” Robles said. “Many of my friends have gone and not come back.”",https://apnews.com/df63a2f9186a4eaaaa531d69d59adf4e,AP,Neutral
Exclusive: New York Fed cracks down on Puerto Rico banks following Venezuela sanctions,Luc Cohen,4/18/19,"U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have led the New York Federal Reserve to crack down on Puerto Rico’s $50 billion offshore banking industry, according to four sources and a document seen by . The corner stone on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the financial district in New York City, U.S. , March 4, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe development will prevent the island’s offshore banks, several of which are owned by citizens of crisisstricken Venezuela, from opening accounts with the Fed that give them direct access to the U.S. financial system. Offshore banks in Puerto Rico are able to open accounts with the Fed since the island is a U.S. territory. That gives them a competitive advantage over other offshore banking jurisdictions like the British Virgin Islands, which have to access the U.S. financial system through expensive thirdparty correspondent banks. But in a previously unreported Feb. 27 letter, the New York Fed said it had halted approval of new accounts for Puerto Rican offshore banks and other financial institutions “in light of recent events, including the expansion of U.S. economic sanctions relating to Venezuela. ”It plans stricter requirements for the opening of such accounts in the future, it said. It did not give further details on why it was taking that step. But the move follows two Puerto Rican offshore banks that have accounts open with the New York Fed being mentioned in federal investigations into money laundering and sanctions evasion related to Venezuela. “The Fed worries about its reputational exposure, just like anybody else does,” said David Murray, a vice president at the Washingtonbased Financial Integrity Network and a former Treasury Department official. A spokeswoman for the New York Fed did not respond to requests for comment. The decision will only affect Puerto Rican banks that had pending applications with the Fed and will not affect the 17 of Puerto Rico’s 80 offshore banks that the Fed’s website shows already have Fedwire accounts.  was unable to determine how many banks were awaiting responses on their applications to open accounts. The move to suspend account approvals shows how U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, which are meant to force socialist President Nicolas Maduro from office amid a political crisis and an economic meltdown, are having a ripple effect in other parts of the global financial system. It could deal a blow to Puerto Rico, which has been using the offshore sector as an economic development strategy as it struggles with a crushing debt load and the impact of natural disasters such as 2017’s Hurricane Maria. The island has for years nurtured its offshore banking sector by offering tax incentives to bank owners and promoting direct access to the U.S. financial system through the Fed rather than correspondent banks, which charge for their services and can end the relationship at a moment’s notice. Offshore banking lets individuals and companies deposit money outside their countries of residence in order to legally lower tax bills, but criminal investigations and multilateral organizations have alleged it is also used for tax evasion and money laundering. The notice also applies to U.S. Virgin Islands offshore banks. Both territories fall under the jurisdiction of the Fed’s New York branch. ‘WE SHARE IT ALL’George Joyner, the commissioner of Puerto Rico’s banking regulator, declined to say how many of the territory’s offshore banks had applications pending with the Fed. He said the island regulator used the same standards as federal authorities including the Fed to supervise financial institutions, and that antimoney laundering was a “high focus. ”“Our office fully shares everything that we find in our examinations, and we share it with all the federal agencies,” Joyner said in a telephone interview. He said “a number” of Puerto Rican offshore banks had been created with Venezuelan capital, without elaborating. The Virgin Islands’ director of banking and insurance did not respond to requests for comment. Sixteen of Puerto Rico’s 80 offshore banking and financial services firms are owned by Venezuelan individuals or companies, according to a  review of their websites, corporate registry records, and directors’ LinkedIn pages and personal websites. Several marketed directly to Venezuelan clients, or had past deals with the Venezuelan government, while twelve of the sixteen had Fedwire accounts, according to the Federal Reserve’s website. Fedwire, a funds transfer system controlled by the Fed, allows banks, businesses and government agencies to send and receive payments in real time. VENEZUELA CONNECTIONSIn recent years, U.S. prosecutors have examined the role Puerto Rico’s offshore banks have played in efforts to launder Venezuelan funds through the United States. It was not clear if the two cases in question contributed to the New York Fed’s decision to halt the opening of new accounts, but one source at a Puerto Rican bank and industry consultant David Nissman said they were likely an important factor. Joyner said they “certainly didn’t help. ”Federal prosecutors in a sprawling corruption probe unsealed in July of 2018 charged Uruguayan national Marcelo Gutierrez with allegedly conspiring to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA through a “bank in Puerto Rico” that he owned, according to criminal investigation filings in Florida federal court. The prosecutors’ complaint does not identify the bank and says the transaction never took place. Gutierrez’s LinkedIn profile lists him as a director at Vestin Bank International, which Puerto Rico banking regulator records show received a license to operate as an offshore operation on the island in 2015. Vestin has since been acquired by Asiafocused Standard International Bank and Gutierrez has not been a shareholder since August of 2018, Standard said in a statement, adding that it had no links to Vestin’s prior business, no ties to Venezuela and no plans to enter the Venezuelan market. Bruce Udolf, a Floridabased defense attorney for Gutierrez, said, “We expect to respond with a vigorous defense to those charges. We are hopeful that he will be vindicated at trial. ”In February, the FBI raided Puerto Rican offshore bank Banco San Juan International (BSJI) as part of a probe of money laundering and evasion of Venezuelarelated sanctions, special agent Douglas Leff told reporters at the time. A spokesman for the FBI San Juan field office declined to provide further details. In 2016, BSJI reached a $300 million credit agreement with PDVSA, according to PDVSA’s financial statements from that year. BSJI also has an account with the Fed, according to Fed records. In a statement, BSJI said it had complied with all U.S. sanctions and was cooperating with the FBI investigation. The source at the bank in Puerto Rico, along with Joyner and Nissman, said most of the island’s offshore banks applied strict scrutiny on customers, and that the decision would punish an entire sector for the actions of a few bad actors. “It just shuts your businesses down, and what did they do?” said Nissman, a former U.S. attorney for the U.S. Virgin Islands who drafted the territory’s offshore banking law, and now a Puerto Ricobased consultant. He said the Fed should evaluate applications on a “casebycase basis. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-puertorico-exclusi-idUSKCN1RU2EI,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico is rebounding after Hurricane Maria,DANICA COTO,4/2/19,"Nearly two years after a deadly hurricane season, tourists are visiting Puerto Rico in record numbers as the U.S. territory continues to rebuild from Hurricane Maria. A record 1.7 million cruise ship passengers are expected to visit this fiscal year, new hotels have opened, additional flights have been added and the smaller of the island’s two international airports saw a record 54,000 passengers in February. A handful of hotels remain closed since the Category 4 storm hit in September 2017 and caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage, but resorts including the Ritz and the Caribe Hilton are slated to open in upcoming months. Overall, life in the capital of San Juan and surrounding areas is back to normal for tourists, although those who venture outside the metropolitan area will likely encounter a smattering of blue roofs, the occasional wayward light post and debris that still hasn’t been collected. Brief power outages still hit occasionally as the government prepares to privatize an aging and poorly maintained grid that was destroyed by the hurricane, and water shortages have hit parts of Puerto Rico’s north coast since 30 percent of the island is experiencing a moderate drought that is affecting 791,000 of its 3.2 million inhabitants. All beaches are open to visitors, and most trails at the tropical forest of El Yunque are open as well, although some popular sites remain temporarily closed to the public as crews continue to clear debris. Some areas that are worth a day trip include El Yunque and the nearby coastal town of Luquillo in northeast Puerto Rico, topped off by a night visit to a nearby bioluminescent bay where visitors can paddle around in a kayak. Also worth visiting are Cueva del Indio and Cueva Ventana on Puerto Rico’s north coast: one offers a seaside glimpse into petroglyphs carved into stone by Taino Indians and the other a sweeping view of the island’s northern karst region. Make sure to leave enough time to follow the lechonera route in Guavate and eat pork in the island’s central mountains, topped off by fritters such as alcapurrias and empanadillas and a shot of chichaito — anise and rum.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-travel-podcast-hurricanes-storms-eb36f05e1b1a4176bb520a076504e33b,AP,Neutral
Court ruling in Puerto Rico bankruptcy fans revenue bond fears,Karen Pierog,3/28/19,"A decision this week by a U.S. Appeals Court in a lawsuit related to Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy raises concerns over the payment of municipal bonds backed by specific revenues during future Chapter 9 cases, Fitch Ratings said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO ,A night view of the middleupper class residential sector of Miramar in San Juan, March 11, 2014. REUTERS/Ana Martinez The Bostonbased First Circuit court on Tuesday determined that municipalities are not required to make payments on debt secured by special revenues while bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, although municipalities can voluntarily opt to do so. “The ruling, by stating such payments are optional,creates uncertainty about full and timely payment of special revenue obligations during bankruptcy of the related municipality,” Fitch said. The credit rating agency added that if the ruling stands, it could negatively affect ratings on certain bonds secured by utility, transportation and tax revenue. The appeals court affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing the island’s bankruptcy, which was filed in 2017 in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of the U.S. commonwealth’s debt and pension obligations. Swain had dismissed a lawsuit by insurance companies guaranteeing payments on defaulted Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority bonds. The bond insurers claimed that payments on the debt from pledged toll and other revenue should not be halted during the bankruptcy. Assured Guaranty Corporation, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said on Thursday it is assessing options, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We disagree with the court’s ruling, which is at odds with prior court decisions and the legislative history relating to special revenue bonds and has potential negative implications for revenue bonds throughout the municipal bond market,” Assured said in a statement. Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy expert James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors, said the appeals court decision came as a surprise to the municipal bond market, which had assumed Swain’s ruling would be reversed. “This could have a very adverse effect on the use of special revenues all over,” he said. Revenue bonds accounted for an average of 64 percent of annual issuance in the $3. 8 trillion municipal market since 1990, according to Refinitiv data. Not all revenue bonds qualify as being backed by special revenues under the bankruptcy code, which specifies special excise taxes or revenue derived from governmental projects or systems providing transportation, utilities or other services.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-bonds-idUSKCN1R92MF,Reuters,Neutral
Trump opposes further disaster aid for battered Puerto Rico,ANDREW TAYLOR,3/26/19,"President Donald Trump’s opposition to further disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico hardened on Tuesday as he told GOP allies at a Capitol Hill meeting that the U.S. island territory has gotten too much rebuilding money compared with mainland states like Florida and Texas. Trump’s ardent opposition to additional Puerto Rico funding sets up a showdown with House Democrats, who insist that a $13 billion to $14 billion disaster aid package that’s a top priority for southern Republicans won’t advance without further aid for the island. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said Trump told Republicans at a closed-door luncheon on Tuesday that aid for Puerto Rico “is way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.” Trump does support $600 million to deal with a food stamp shortfall in Puerto Rico that has already meant slashed benefits, Rubio said, but opposes more generous terms for delivery of disaster aid dollars and funding to rebuild antiquated water systems and make them more resilient to future storms. The disaster aid package cleared a procedural hurdle by a 90-10 vote and is expected to pass the Senate as early as late this week, which would set up talks with the Democratic-controlled House. House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said the House will insist on further aid for Puerto Rico or the disaster aid measure won’t clear Congress. “Nearly 3,000 American lives were lost in the historic storms that devastated Puerto Rico and destroyed its infrastructure, and the island is still struggling to recover,” Lowey said in a joint statement with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. The measure has wide support from both Democrats and Republicans and is ardently backed by Trump loyalists such as David Perdue, R-Ga., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., whose states were slammed by hurricanes last fall. The measure has been expanded so that Midwestern states such as Iowa and Nebraska that are currently suffering from flooding are eligible for disaster help. “Just at the time when harvesting was starting, Hurricane Michael hit and crops were completely destroyed across most of our state,” Perdue said. The House passed a companion $14.2 billion version of the legislation in January, but it got tangled up in the politics of the partial government shutdown and Trump’s demands for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The measure is especially sought by lawmakers from Southern states like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which were hit by hurricanes Michael and Florence last year. There’s money to respond to an earthquake in Alaska, wildfires in California and floods in South Carolina and for the ongoing recovery effort in Puerto Rico, which was devastated by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017. The Trump administration has been slow to deliver the aid to Puerto Rico that Congress has already approved for the island. “The lack of leadership and coordination, combined with delays in meeting the basic needs of the island, more than eighteen months after receiving a presidential disaster declaration, has left far too many children and elderly citizens in unhealthy and unsafe conditions, families in severely damaged homes, and communities without adequate infrastructure to sustain a decent quality of life,” Leahy and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a letter to the White House on Tuesday.",https://apnews.com/df711dcff96a41218161a452340f0325,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico lures tech developers as hurricane season looms,DANICA COTO,3/20/19,"In the dark and isolating days after Hurricane Maria, people across Puerto Rico invented new ways to communicate: Elderly couples in need of food or water would raise a flag at their home. Neighbors created amateur security systems, banging on pots for a minute each night to mark the start of a curfew after which any human noise would be considered a call for help. With telephone service blown away by the Category 4 hurricane, the governor took to the only radio station still operating and asked listeners to tell the mayors of all 78 municipalities to drive to the capital and update authorities about their needs in person. Access to devastated areas was impossible, and police, firefighters and emergency responders were unable to talk to each other for days. “The biggest crisis after Maria was communication,” said Nazario Lugo, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Emergency Managers. “That unleashed an endless number of problems.” Now several groups of young tech developers are trying to prevent that from happening the next time a major disaster strikes. They are roving Puerto Rico with laptops, transmitters and drones to test new systems that could help survivors communicate with authorities and speed up response times to minimize the number of deaths. Puerto Rico is considered an ideal site to test and refine these inventions due to the Sept. 20, 2017, storm and its aftermath that claimed an estimated 2,975 lives. Technology is also lagging on an island where police and firefighters lack an interoperable system to communicate with each other. One team of developers backed by IBM is sticking transmitters to trees with Velcro as part of a hardware and software system they invented called Project OWL, which stands for Organization, Whereabouts, and Logistics. It won a $200,000 prize at a Call for Code competition late last year in which 100,000 developers from 156 nations participated — an event focused on natural disaster preparedness and relief. “We were thinking, ‘How can we make this in a way so stupidly simple to be used that you don’t even have to think about it?’” said Project OWL team leader Bryan Knouse. “It’s really hard to tell people who have been through a disaster, ‘Download this app or go to this website.’ Not gonna happen.” The tiny transmitter boxes emit a low-frequency Wi-Fi connection that users can link to via smartphones. Once connected, a pop-up box in English and Spanish automatically appears and people can enter information including name, location, number of pets, medical needs and hazards such as fallen trees, downed power lines, fires or blocked roads. The information is relayed back through the network and eventually to emergency officials. The team recently made its first large-area test of system in the northwest coastal town of Isabela. One group got into a car and stopped repeatedly to affix transmitters around a 1 square-mile area while another group led by Knouse stayed at the home base, which that day consisted of the roof of a barbecue joint that provided enough height to collect the signals. Further boosting the signal were two large cream-colored balloons bought at Party City fitted with a transmitter. The transmitters are powered by batteries and maybe eventually solar power, and the team envisions the system working in places from the U.S. mainland to India to Japan. Every couple of minutes, Knouse’s computer dinged with messages that included names, location and details of the roving group that popped up on a map with messages such as “Help me please!” and “NEED WATER!!!” The team later met with members of a local Boys and Girls Club to introduce the technology to young users in hopes they could teach and share it with their neighbors. Isabela’s mayor, Carlos Delgado, said he was impressed by the project and wishes it was invented before Maria shredded the island’s telecommunications system. He lamented how city officials had to walk to dozens of neighborhoods to learn about people’s needs after the hurricane, which delayed the delivery of food, water and medicine. “It was a bit like going back to the start of humanity: everything was done on foot,” he said. Another project is led by Pedro Cruz, a self-taught Puerto Rican tech developer who recently won a local hackathon with a project called DroneAid. He recalled seeing messages such as “SOS” and “WE NEED FOOD” scrawled in big letters on roads so they could be seen from the air after Maria. He envisions before a storm giving people 5-foot-long mats with standardized symbols indicating needs — such as food, water or medical care — that could be spread out on flat surfaces. Programmed drones could fly overhead, read the symbols and process them into data about needs and locations for emergency responders. The idea came to him when he was physically unable to reach his grandmother after Maria. He could not communicate with her and worried about her respiratory and heart conditions. So he flew his drone to her house, and she waved through the window. “She heard the drone and knew it was me,” Cruz said, adding that his grandmother died two months after Maria from respiratory and cardiac failure at an intensive care unit in a hospital hit by frequent blackouts. As he continued to fly his drone across Puerto Rico in the days and weeks after Maria, he noticed that sometimes food and water were being delivered to neighborhoods that already had been supplied, while others went begging: “There were a lot of duplicated efforts.” He said his system might help avoid that. Other tech companies have jumped at the opportunity to provide connectivity in the storm’s aftermath, including Google, which obtained an experimental license from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to provide emergency cellular service through Loon balloons. The project helped connect more than 200,000 people and began winding down in March 2018. However, Lugo, a former emergency management director for Puerto Rico, warned the U.S. territory still needs to strengthen and update its communications system before the hurricane season starts on June 1. He also stressed that authorities should allow regular citizens and amateur radio operators to participate in that system. “Communication should not be restricted,” he said, adding that the government needs to embrace new technology. “We’re still far behind.”",https://apnews.com/article/technology-latin-america-hurricanes-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-36ad55904ab6459db6a0521d92490b90,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board to appeal appointments ruling,Reuters Staff,2/28/19,"A recent U.S. Appeals Court ruling that found Puerto Rico’s federally created fiscal oversight board was unconstitutionally appointed will be appealed to the Supreme Court, the board announced on Thursday. The board, which was authorized under a 2016 federal law known as PROMESA, also said it is seeking to put on hold the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals’ decision to set a 90day period to allow President Donald Trump and the Senate to constitutionally validate the appointments or reconstitute the board. In a Feb. 15 ruling, the Bostonbased appeals court said oversight board members are principal U.S. officers and should have been appointed by the president “with the advice and consent of the Senate. ”The board said it was established “as an entity within the government of Puerto Rico and not the federal government” and that the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause does not apply to its members. “PROMESA’s appointment process has established a bipartisan board, ensuring balanced decisions to help Puerto Rico recover and prosper,” a statement from the board said, adding that a majority of its members voted for the appeal. The litigation, which was filed by creditors of the U.S. commonwealth, including Aurelius Investment LLC and bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, also sought a dismissal of Puerto Rico’s Title III bankruptcy cases ,a move the appeals court rejected. The island is trying to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations in federal court. U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing the island’s bankruptcy, ruled in July that the appointment of the board’s members did not violate the U.S. Constitution. John Elwood, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins, said the case is a credible candidate for review “because a court has held that an act of Congress is unconstitutional. ”“It’s just not clear to me how broadly important this ruling is,” he added. The Supreme Court hears less than 100 of the thousands of appeals filed each year. If it were to take up the Puerto Rico case, it would likely be decided in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2020.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1QH2LU,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico Gov: Trump refuses meeting over hurricane relief,STEVE PEOPLES,2/22/19,"President Donald Trump has refused to meet privately with Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello, the governor said Friday, as he condemned the Trump administration for not providing more disaster relief in the 17 months since Hurricane Maria devastated the U.S. territory and left thousands dead. The Democratic governor, who has been reluctant to lash out at the Trump administration at times, said the Republican president himself bears responsibility for the slow pace of disaster relief. “Eventually the buck has to stop somewhere,” Rossello said Friday on the opening day of the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. “It has to stop with the president.” While the governor’s team has been in regular contact with federal officials, Rossello said he made public and private requests in recent weeks to meet with the president. The White House denied the requests without giving a reason, he said. A White House official noted that instead of making Trump available, the administration arranged a meeting between Rossello and Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Brock Long, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Rossello said he hoped to address Puerto Rico’s challenges with Trump directly during a White House meeting with dozens of governors on Monday. “There is no movement,” Rossello said. “We really need action right now.” He compared the pace of recovery with the effort after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005: Seventeen months after Katrina, federal officials had produced more than 10,000 “project worksheets,” while 17 months after Maria, just 60 have been produced, he said. The form describes the work necessary to restore a facility that was damaged or destroyed. The September 2017 storm caused an estimated $100 billion in damage and left an estimated 3,000 people dead. Trump has denied the estimated death toll, suggesting the number was made up to make him look bad. Some Puerto Rican Trump critics have suggested bigotry as a factor behind the Trump administration’s lack of attention to the Caribbean Island, where Spanish is most residents’ first language. Rossello would not say one way or another whether he suspected racism. “I would hope that in this time in the United States, the greatest nation on the planet, that was made great because of immigrants and diversity, that that wouldn’t be the prevailing thought,” he said when asked whether he feared Trump was motivated by racism. “That would be my hope, because if it is, it’s a scary prospect not only for Puerto Rico but for everyone.” ___ AP writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-ricardo-rossello-hurricanes-puerto-rico-f24fe0b4302844d99231f09a58a7b9ff,AP,Neutral
New sales tax bonds issued under latest Puerto Rico debt restructuring,Reuters Staff,2/12/19,"Puerto Rico’s Sales Tax Financing Corporation, known as COFINA, issued $12 billion of new bonds on Tuesday as a federal courtapproved deal between the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth and its creditors took effect, according to island officials. The plan of adjustment approved by U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain on Feb. 4 restructures about $17 billion of sales taxbacked debt, leaving senior bondholders to recover 93 percent of their original investment, while junior bondholders recover only 56 percent. The island, which is trying to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension liabilities through a form of municipal bankruptcy that Swain is overseeing, previously won court approval for a consensual deal with creditors over about $4 billion of debt related to its Government Development Bank (GDB). According to Puerto Rico’s federally created oversight board, the COFINA plan will slash debt service on the sales taxbacked debt by $17. 5 billion over nearly 40 years, saving the island an average $456 million annually. Future sales tax revenue previously pledged exclusively to COFINA will be split, with 53 percent going to COFINA bondholders and 46 percent flowing to the commonwealth government. The new COFINA bonds were listed on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s disclosure website with maturities in 2047 and 2054. “Today’s achievement is proof that the Government of Puerto Rico can accomplish creative restructuring solutions that safeguard the interests of the people of Puerto Rico,” Governor Ricardo Rosselló said in a statement. The oversight board said on Tuesday it has certified a fiscal 2019 budget for COFINA that includes money to cover the entity’s past and future operating expenses. S&P Global Ratings said last week that the credit quality of the restructured COFINA bonds is tied to Puerto Rico’s longterm credit picture. “While the COFINA settlement provides a degree of certainty with respect to the commonwealth’s balance sheet, the absence of audited financial statements and continuing uncertainty around retirement obligations stands in the way of our ability to assess its longterm creditworthiness,” S&P said. The oversight board has turned its attention to the island’s core debt of roughly $13 billion of general obligation bonds and almost $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Last month, the board asked Swain to invalidate more than $6 billion of GO bonds, contending the debt had been issued in violation of the Puerto Rico Constitution.

"U.S. hurricane response slower in Puerto Rico than in Florida, Texas: study",Ankur Banerjee,2/5/19,"The U.S. government’s response in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 fell short of federal responses to other major storms that year, researchers say. The U.S. deployed resources faster in Florida and Texas after Irma and Harvey than in Puerto Rico after Maria, their analysis found. The “remarkable disparity in the speed and generosity of federal response . . . is probably large enough to help explain the vastly larger number of deaths” in Puerto Rico, researcher Scott Greer of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor said by email. All three hurricanes “wreaked havoc, destroying lives and infrastructure, with lasting consequences,” Greer and colleagues write in BMJ Global Health. But while Harvey and Irma were each linked with fewer than 150 deaths, fatalities related to Maria in Puerto Rico totaled nearly 3,000, researchers at George Washington University estimated in a 2018 study. A 2018 study by Harvard researchers put the island’s death toll even higher. Compared to the speed with which federal workers were deployed on the mainland, federal staffing in Puerto Rico after Maria took three times as long to reach comparable levels as in Texas and 30 times as long as in Florida, Greer’s team reports. Within two months after landfall, survivors on the mainland had received nearly $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Maria survivor funds did not reach $1 billion until four months after landfall, the researchers say. Differences like these “would be unsurprising” if Maria were a weaker hurricane, Greer’s team writes. But Harvey and Irma hit the mainland as category 4 storms, and Maria hit Puerto Rico “just below the threshold of a category 5. ”Greer’s team analyzed data from FEMA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, congressional appropriations records, vital statistics offices and news articles. They say FEMA did not report data consistently and did not respond to data requests. “It is very important to be willing to take a hard look” at these data, Dr. Lynn Goldman, senior author on last year’s George Washington University study, told  Health by phone. Goldman was not involved in the current study. The emergency response in Puerto Rico became highly politicized as the Trump administration was castigated as being slow to recognize the extent of the devastation and provide disaster relief to the island territory. The administration argued that delays in Puerto Rico were due to geographic limitations, Greer and colleagues note. Greer’s team, however, believes the slower distribution of aid in Puerto Rico is more likely explained by congressional negotiations seeking to prove the territory had insufficient assets and required financial assistance. Greer said elected officials who pushed hardest for Puerto Rico were from states with large Puerto Rican populations, regardless of party. He believes the disaster response on the island would have been different if the territory had its own voting representatives in the U.S. Congress. A FEMA spokesperson responded, “the insinuation that federal response (to Maria) was ‘slower’ is absurd,” in an emailed statement. “FEMA’s response efforts in Puerto Rico is the largest and longest commodity delivery mission in the agency’s history,” the spokesperson said. “There were real challenges in Puerto Rico that had to be overcome ,including aging infrastructure, a decayed power grid and liquidity issues . . .

Elizabeth Warren pledges help during visit to Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,1/23/19,"Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised to help rebuild Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria and support laws to give the U.S. territory equal treatment and debt relief as she condemned President Donald Trump during a visit Tuesday to the island, which has become an obligatory stop for potential and presidential candidates. Warren demanded the resignation of Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And she criticized Trump for denying the hurricane’s death toll and for considering the use of disaster recovery funds to build what she called a “dumb” border wall, provoking laughter and applause from a crowd of a couple hundred people gathered in a small theater. “Puerto Rico has not been treated with respect,” she said. “It is insulting. It is disrespectful. This ugliness has gone far enough. Puerto Rico has suffered enough. We will not allow anyone to sabotage your recovery, not even the president of the United States.” Democrats are using official trips to Puerto Rico as an opportunity to criticize the Trump administration for how it responded to the hurricane and its aftermath. Last week, former housing secretary Julian Castro, who has declared himself a candidate, visited the island and toured communities still struggling more than a year after the storm. The visits have perplexed some and annoyed others in Puerto Rico, whose people are U.S. citizens who can vote in primaries but are barred from voting in presidential elections. Janina Cabret, a 28-year-old San Juan resident who attended Warren’s event, said she hopes whoever wins isn’t delivering empty promises about helping the island. “Even though they use it for marketing, at least it puts Puerto Rico on the map,” she said. Warren said too many homes still lack a proper roof and too many insurance claims have gone unpaid, among other problems that persist more than a year after Hurricane Maria. She also said many people who fled Puerto Rico after the storm have not been able to find a job, housing or health care. Warren reminded the crowd that she voted against a 2016 financial aid package that created a federal control board to oversee the debt-burdened island government’s finances, a body that some complain has imposed an excessive amount of austerity. She also referred to White House comments on Puerto Rico, including a recent one opposing $600 million in nutritional assistance as “excessive and unnecessary,” which angered Gov. Ricardo Rossello’s administration. The senator also talked about the island’s political status, long a key issue for many Puerto Ricans, though five referendums over the years have shown no clear consensus for statehood, the current territorial status or independence. “Puerto Rico deserves self-determination on this question, and I will support the decision of the people of Puerto Rico,” she said. Warren also called for auditing Puerto Rico’s huge public debt, strengthening unions, protecting the island from climate change, and supporting full child tax credits, Medicaid funding and nutritional assistance for islanders, all things that many Puerto Ricans have long demanded. “Puerto Rico’s experience in recent years reflects the worst of what Washington has become, a government that works great for the rich and powerful, and not for anyone else,” she said as she mentioned drug companies, student loan outfits, fossil fuel companies and Wall Street bankers. “We need to take back our federal government from the wealthy and well-connected and return it to the people.” Warren said she would demand that anyone running for federal office post their tax returns online as she has and touted her anti-corruption legislation, which in part calls for ending lobbying and stopping federal lobbyists from giving money to elected officials. She also charged that Trump’s administration has used its power to inflict cruelty on immigrants and people of color. “With Trump, cruelty is not an accident, it is part of the plan,” she said. The audience gave Warren a standing ovation at the end of her speech, many of them tourists thrilled that their visit coincided with hers. Vandy Young, a tourist from Maryland, said she is hopeful about a presidential bid by Warren. “I’ve been waiting for her to run,” she said. “She’s one of the few candidates who can stand up to Trump. She’s not afraid of him.”",https://apnews.com/63c3539129c1453aa32aa0b3a9f36542,AP,Neutral
US shutdown threatens to delay major Puerto Rico debt case,DANICA COTO,1/17/19,"The federal government shutdown could delay the outcome of a major debt restructuring case in Puerto Rico, leaving many in suspense after a long-awaited hearing on the deal ended Thursday without a ruling. The deal involves more than $17 billion worth of government bonds backed by a sales-and-use tax. Opponents urged a federal judge to wait until the Internal Revenue Service can decide whether the exchange of those bonds should be treated as taxable or tax-free. And the IRS is among the agencies affected by the shutdown. Judge Laura Taylor-Swain said she would not immediately rule on the deal, which was recently approved after more than 8,000 bondholders voted on it. “I thank you all for the privilege of being in the entirely challenging position of making these important decisions for the future of Puerto Rico,” she told the court. If approved, Puerto Rico would pay $32 billion in the next 40 years. Senior bondholders, who hold nearly $8 billion, will be first to collect, receiving 93 percent of the value of the original bonds. Junior bondholders, many of whom are individual Puerto Rican investors and overall hold nearly $10 billion, will collect last and recover only 54 percent. Junior bondholders who oppose the deal told the judge on Thursday that they were not adequately represented during the mediation process before it was approved. “Puerto Rico took our money. Now it just wants to keep it,” said Peter Hein, an attorney and junior bondholder who spoke from New York. “If Puerto Rico can just brush off ... bondholders ... respectfully, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut are not going to be far behind.” Also speaking from New York was Lawrence Devores, another junior bondholder. He reiterated that his group was not given opportunity to participate in the deal and criticized what he called “secret bargaining.” “Not only are we not getting a same recovery as the seniors ... but we’re also being treated in a very miserable, shoddy way,” he said. “It was a settlement imposed only by people looking out for themselves.” The elderly man said the bonds they would receive if the deal is approved would “mature well after I’m gone.” Several attorneys, including Dennis Dunne with Ambac Assurance, rejected the accusations and said no one was forbidden from participation. Dunne said everyone had a choice between protracted, costly litigation or a settlement, adding that the deal is not ideal “but the alternatives were worse.” Government officials also have said that Puerto Rico would receive an initial $350 million that will grow as part of the deal, money they say is urgently needed amid a 12-year recession and in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But a group of activists that includes economists and attorneys who have long sought an independent analysis of Puerto Rico’s debt argue that a portion of the sales-tax-backed debt is illegal. They also noted that nearly half of the debt is in hands of only 17 companies, including hedge funds. Peter Friedman, a government attorney, said the lengthy litigation has already served as an audit, saying that everyone has examined the debt’s validity in “extreme detail.” On Monday, the control board asked Swain to invalidate $6 billion worth of debt issued by Puerto Rico, including all general obligation bonds issued in 2012 and 2014, alleging that issuance violated debt limits established by the island’s Constitution. Swain is holding a hearing on the issue at month’s end. If the deal involving sales-and-use-tax-backed bonds is approved, it would be the second debt-restructuring agreement since Puerto Rico announced it was unable to pay its debt in June 2015. In November, it completed the first with creditors holding more than $4 billion in debt issued by the now-defunct Government Development Bank. During Thursday’s public speaking period, Puerto Rico resident Rafaela Estevez said she opposes the deal in part because she does not trust the government’s intent. “Certain individuals are looking to make profit off the misery of our people,” she said. “The people of Puerto Rico have had enough.”",https://apnews.com/40e64db192d54e369b6a89efd42e0732,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board asks court to invalidate $6 billion GO bonds,Luis Valentin Ortiz,1/14/19,"Puerto Rico’s federally appointed fiscal oversight board announced late Monday that it will seek to invalidate in federal court more than $6 billion of general obligation (GO) bonds. The action is aimed at three GO debt issues sold by the U.S. territory in 2012 and 2014 that were already in default. The board said in a statement that the debt had been issued “in clear violation of the Puerto Rico Constitution and should be declared null and void. ”The oversight board and Puerto Rico’s unsecured creditors committee jointly asked U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who oversees the island’s bankruptcy cases, to wipe out more than $6 billion of GO debt by disallowing any claims filed to date by owners of these bonds. With roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, Puerto Rico and four of its public corporations commenced bankruptcy proceedings in U.S. court in May 2017, under Title III of the socalled PROMESA Act. A 600page report commissioned by the oversight board released last August pointed to potential causes of actions over Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, including potential violations of the island’s constitutional debt limit. Monday’s announcement is the first major action taken by the fiscal panel after considering potential claims arising from the report. Some 2014 bonds due in 2035 with an 8 percent coupon traded earlier on Monday at 53. 5 cents on the dollar.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-bonds-idUSKCN1P90AH,Reuters,Neutral
"To ovations, Hamilton’s star reprises role in Puerto Rico",DANICA COTO,1/12/19,"Lin-Manuel Miranda reprised his lead role in the hit musical “Hamilton” to start a two-week run in Puerto Rico expected to raise millions of dollars for artists and cultural groups struggling in the wake of Hurricane Maria. The audience giggled, hooted, clapped and tapped their feet throughout Friday’s night’s performance as Miranda took the stage for the first time since his last appearance in the Broadway version in July 2016, when he played the role of U.S. founding father Alexander Hamilton. “I have never felt anything like that,” he said of the crowd’s energy, adding that singing the song “Hurricane” was a challenge. “It was very hard to sing that here in Puerto Rico because you know better than I what it is to survive a hurricane. I feel like I’m going back to Maria a little bit every time I sing it.” After the two-hour show, Miranda spoke with reporters, who peppered him with questions including how the White House was exploring diverting money for border wall construction from a range of accounts, including using some of the $13.9 billion allocated to the Army Corps of Engineers after last year’s deadly hurricanes and floods. “I think that’s absolutely monstrous,” Miranda said as he apologized that he didn’t have further comment. “It’s the first time I’m hearing that. I’ve been a little busy.” It’s the first time in nine years that Miranda has performed in Puerto Rico. Opening night drew more than 1,000 people who bought tickets ranging from $10 to $5,000. Among the attendees was Ron Chernow, the Pulitzer Prize winner whose biography of Alexander Hamilton inspired the musical. He told The Associated Press that it was the most extraordinary Miranda performance he has seen. “There was an extra passion and pain and sadness and beauty that he brought to his character,” Chernow said. “This was no ordinary performance tonight.” The crowd gave Miranda a standing ovation before the show even started, and during the curtain call he wiped away tears and wrapped himself in a large Puerto Rican flag as he briefly addressed the crowd in Spanish and English. During the show’s intermission, accountant Zoraida Alvira sat absorbed as she read the three-page synopsis since she struggles a bit with English. It was the first time she had seen a musical and was transfixed. “Here in Puerto Rico we are not too exposed to theater, let alone musicals,” she said as she praised the performance. “I didn’t move, and I’m a fidgety person.” Alvira, like several other Puerto Ricans who attended opening night, snapped up her ticket thanks to a lottery launched by “Hamilton” organizers who are selling 275 tickets for every performance at $10 each. Others in the audience on Friday included musician Questlove and TV producer Shonda Rhimes. Among those expected to attend the show in upcoming days are several federal lawmakers visiting the U.S. territory for the weekend to learn more about reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Maria, which caused more than $100 billion in damage when it hit on Sept. 20, 2017. Even people who didn’t have tickets showed up at the venue. “This is a very important moment for Puerto Rico right now,” said Vivian Rodriguez, a student who lives in Puerto Rico but is from New York. She noted that Friday is Hamilton’s birthday, and she said Puerto Rico has suffered from what she described as its “colonial” status. “Hamilton” was initially going to be staged at the University of Puerto Rico from Jan. 8 to 27, but producers announced in December that it was moving to the Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferre following the threat of protests by university employees upset over enrollment changes at the island’s largest public university. The change forced some people on the U.S. mainland to forego their Hamilton tickets because they were unable or could not afford to change their airline tickets to accommodate the show’s new dates. Others were upset when they did not hear back from the agency responsible for reassigning new dates for previously purchased tickets. “It has been such a nightmare for me,” said Myla Ruiz, who lives in the northern coastal town of Toa Baja and had gotten tickets for the original opening night. Her husband is now unable to go because he will be on a work trip, and then she struggled to get a response from the agency selling the tickets. She is now reluctantly attending the show’s last night. “I’m originally from New York, so I’m a huge fan of Broadway,” she said. “This to me is huge. There’s nothing like Broadway here. When they said this was coming, it’s all I’ve been talking about.” The show also drew the attention of Jimmy Fallon, whose “Tonight Show” will air its Jan. 15 episode from Puerto Rico with Miranda and the new touring cast. Miranda, composer and creator of “Hamilton,” won a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize for the musical. ___ Danica Coto on Twitter: https://twitter.com/danicacoto",https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-latin-america-ap-top-news-music-hurricanes-25106f28d02f46fba8e4d5e3f6f651d6,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico completes its first debt restructuring deal,DANICA COTO,11/29/18,"The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico said Thursday that it has completed its first debt-restructuring deal since the government announced it was bankrupt more than three years ago, giving creditors overall $550 in new bonds for each $1,000 they had held. The agreement was finalized with creditors holding more than $4 billion in debt issued by the now-defunct Government Development Bank. The bank once issued loans and oversaw the island’s debt transactions but ceased operations in March amid a 12-year recession. “The closing of the GDB debt restructuring is a historic milestone in Puerto Rico’s road to economic recovery,” said Gov. Ricardo Rossello. “It is clear evidence that Puerto Rico has the credibility and resolve necessary to resolve its fiscal challenges.” It’s not clear, however, how much the agreement will affect some $70 billion in other debt still outstanding. Much of that is being addressed in court rather than in voluntary agreements. The government said its Debt Recovery Authority will soon issue nearly $2.6 billion in bonds to the creditors. However, some economists are wary of the agreement, uncertain if the payments can be sustained because of the fragility of Puerto Rico’s finances and the ongoing crisis that was caused in part by previous administrations borrowing millions of dollars to cover ballooning deficits. “A lot of us economists are concerned that these deals are temporary and don’t guarantee that Puerto Rico won’t fall into another debt crisis,” economist Jose Caraballo said by phone. However, he praised the way the deal gives different treatment to different sorts of bondholders. One group, made up largely of hedge funds, will be paid first but at a lower percentage of their original investments. A second group, which includes local investors, will get paid later but receive a larger percentage. But Caraballo warned another crisis may hit the island before the second group gets paid, and he said the deal does not end Puerto Rico’s financial troubles because the accord isn’t based on the government’s long-term ability to pay. “These agreements are not sustainable,” he said. “It’s not the end of the story. It’s a comma in the middle of this crisis.” Another economist, Vicente Feliciano, noted that the deal depends on municipalities continuing to make payments out of the property tax they collect. Property values have been hit by large-scale migration off the island due to economic woes and last year’s devastating Hurricane Maria, which caused estimated damage of more than $100 billion. “There’s always a risk that at some point the municipalities may have challenges meeting their obligations,” he said in a phone interview. Overall, Puerto Rico agencies still hold roughly $70 billion in public debt and are trying to restructure a portion of it via court and mutual agreements with creditors. A federal control board appointed by Congress is overseeing the bankruptcy-like process as well as Puerto Rico’s finances. In January, a federal judge is expected to rule on a billion-dollar debt restructuring deal involving bonds backed by a sales tax.",https://apnews.com/5cc17113f2ba47f6aca7657aa5345c01,AP,Neutral
UPDATE 3-Judge approves Puerto Rico consensual debt restructuring deal,Luis Valentin Ortiz,11/6/18,"A U.S. judge on Tuesday approved Puerto Rico’s first consensual debt restructuring deal, helping wind down the Government Development Bank (GDB), the island’s former fiscal agent. Government lawyers called the confirmation hearing a “historic moment” for the U.S. commonwealth’s financial recovery. “I’m glad we took this step forward toward a new foundation for Puerto Rico,” said Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who presides over the island’s bankruptcy cases under a federal law known as PROMESA. The GDB deal addresses approximately $4 billion out of Puerto Rico’s $72 billion in existing debt. In total, the bankrupt island has $120 billion in both debt and pension obligations. “The court’s approval represents a major milestone in the restructuring of Puerto Rico’s debt obligations,” said Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico. The plan, overwhelmingly approved by creditors in September, will transfer to a GDB Debt Recovery Authority the bank’s municipal loan portfolios, real estate assets and unencumbered cash. The authority will issue new bonds backed by a statutory lien on those assets in an amount equal to 55 percent of outstanding debt. The deal also calls for establishment of a Public Entity Trust, which would mostly receive nonperforming loans made by the GDB to other government entities. During Tuesday’s approval hearing, only one party, Siemens Transportation, opposed the transaction over a $13 million claim against the government bank. The dispute was settled during the lunch break, paving the way for Swain’s final approval of the restructuring deal. GDB’s president and executive director of the Financial Advisory & Fiscal Agency Authority (FAFAA), Christian Sobrino, told  that the deal is “a moment of great satisfaction” and “vindication” following years of negotiations with hedge funds, island municipalities, local credit unions and other GDB creditors. The FAFAA became the island’s fiscal agent following the GDB’s insolvency. “It is the first time that Puerto Rico or any other U.S. territory uses Title VI of PROMESA,” added Sobrino, in reference to the federal law’s consensual debtrestructuring mechanism. He said “two or three” other Puerto Rico issuers could use the same legal restructuring framework as the GDB, but did not name them because work remains to be done. Puerto Rico’s government and four of its public corporations last year filed for a courtordered bankruptcy process under Title III; Swain will hold a general hearing on that on Wednesday. Lead financial and legal advisers for the Ad Hoc Group of GDB Bondholders are Ducera Partners and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, respectively. The government’s lead legal adviser was O’Melveny & Myers while Ankura provided financial advice. Puerto Rico’s defaulted benchmark general obligation bonds maturing in 2035 with an 8 percent coupon weakened slightly but held near last week’s 16month high to end at 60. 25 cents on the dollar.

"Scientists to explore new sites in Puerto Rico, USVI waters",DANICA COTO,10/29/18,"Scientists will explore new sites in deep waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn more about coral and fish habitats as part of a 22-day mission led by the U.S. government. The team aboard the 224-foot (68-meter) Okeanos Explorer also will map geological features up to 3.7 miles (6,000 meters) deep to better understand hazards such as earthquakes that have hit the Caribbean region in recent years, Daniel Wagner, expedition coordinator with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Monday. “We will probably see things that have never been documented,” he said. “Some of the places we’re diving have never been mapped before.” The mission starts Tuesday and ends Nov. 20. The team will target waters around Puerto Rico and St. Croix island in an operation involving 210 scientists around the world, most of whom will be watching live video feeds, with the ability to instantly request imagery or collection of samples. The 20 sites the ship will visit were chosen from a list of 80 submitted by scientists worldwide, with eight-hour dives taking place during the day and mapping being done at night, Wagner said. They include marine protected areas and the site of a 1918 earthquake that generated a tsunami, killing more than 100 people in Puerto Rico. The area where the quake originated has never been explored, Wagner said. Scientists will use sonar systems and remotely operated vehicles to track deep-water fish, sponges and corals, as well as to explore valleys, trenches, submarine canyons and two large tectonic plates located north of Puerto Rico. Studies of populations of groupers and red snapper are a priority because they are commercially popular fish, scientists said. One of the mission’s objectives is to support conservation and management efforts, said Steven Auscavitch, the expedition’s co-leader. “We know virtually nothing about what is at the bottom of these areas,” he said. Derek Sowers, who will oversee the mapping mission, said some sonars will help determine the abundance of life in deep waters, while others will be used to map the seafloor and analyze what it’s composed of, down to 260 feet (80 meters) beyond the bottom. It is part of a larger expedition aimed at learning more about the North Atlantic Ocean. The scientists say that waters around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are among the least explored waters in any U.S. jurisdiction.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-caribbean-fish-corals-puerto-rico-8cdd3ba385a14ae1872ca54aa55dcf68,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico's revised fiscal plan approved over government opposition,Luis Valentin Ortiz,10/23/18,"Puerto Rico’s federally appointed financial oversight board on Tuesday unanimously approved a revised fiscal reform plan meant to put the bankrupt island on a path toward solvency, but faced opposition from its elected government for being too strict. FILE PHOTO: Natalie Jaresko, Executive Director of the Federal Fiscal Control Board of Puerto Rico attends a meeting of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico at the College of Engineers and Land Surveyors in San Juan, Puerto Rico October 31, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez/File PhotoThe seven board members voted in favor of the plan even though some raised concerns about its ultimate viability to help Puerto Rico resume fiscal balance and economic growth. “Frankly speaking, I don’t like this fiscal plan,” said Ana Matosantos, a board member who expressed concerns over the magnitude of government spending cuts, which she said could “seriously weaken” services to citizens. As in previous versions, the U.S. commonwealth’s revised fiscal plan calls for a range of fiscal and structural reforms as well as stiff reductions in government spending. In addition to revised data on actual revenues and expenses, the new plan was updated to account for lower levels of migration from the island following last year’s Hurricane Maria, as well as an additional $20 billion in federal disaster relief funding. It also imposes more cuts to government spending, which have raised opposition from the island’s government. “This is not a fiscal plan for economic development, this is an austerity plan,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said as the board met in San Juan to approve revised fiscal plans for both the commonwealth and the University of Puerto Rico. The revised plan for the commonwealth calls for a reduction of $427 million in government spending across agencies for this fiscal year, almost doubling to $926 million in fiscal year 2020. Overall, the plan also projects a cumulative $30 billion surplus during the next 15 years, mainly triggered by the more than $80 billion in disaster relief funding for the Caribbean island following Maria and Hurricane Irma. Rossello said that “money will be available to bondholders, but to the detriment of the most vulnerable and our people. This is simply unfair. ”U.S. President Donald Trump entered the fray with a tweet on Tuesday accusing Puerto Rico’s politicians, without providing evidence, of using “massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding” to pay off other debts, and said he would not allow a bailout with relief money. However, both the board’s executive director, Natalie Jaresko, and chairman, Jose Carrion, immediately rejected the idea that disaster relief funding was being used to pay off debt obligations. Asked at a news conference on Tuesday about the tweet, Jaresko responded that federal disaster relief funding does not go directly into the calculation of the surplus figures, except for the impact these monies have on the island’s economy. Carrion further stated that the panel has no evidence that the commonwealth government is using disaster relief funds to pay for other purposes than the ones for which they were allocated. In an interview with  last month, Rossello said the island has received only a small fraction of the federal funding, roughly $3 billion to $4 billion, it needs to get back on its feet and that getting access to the rest could take more than a decade. The federal government has earmarked only about $60 billion to $65 billion for recovery versus the $139 billion that Rossello’s administration estimates it needs to fully recover, the governor said in the interview. POLITICAL WILLOn Monday, Jaresko said in a conference call with reporters that there was an “ongoing lack of political will” to implement certain measures, such as changes to labor laws to make Puerto Rico an atwill employment jurisdiction. “Labor reform is not the endall beall of this,” said Christian Sobrino, the governor’s representative to the fiscal panel created by the socalled federal PROMESA law. “You can count on our collaboration to succeed, but we will not be jammed into failure,” he added. The board released the latest version of the fiscal plan to the public on Monday, spurring a rally in the government’s defaulted general obligation bonds. Investors cited how the plan shows an ability to pay debt service costs. The benchmark GO debt due in 2035 with an 8 percent coupon held just below Monday’s highs at 59. 875 cents on the dollar, off 0. 375 point in price, according to data from Refinitiv.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-fiscal-idUSKCN1MX23J,Reuters,Neutral
"Board urges Puerto Rico to implement tax, labor reforms",DANICA COTO,10/22/18,"The executive director of a federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances said Monday that the island is likely to receive $20 billion more than initially estimated in federal relief as it rebuilds from Hurricane Maria. Overall, Puerto Rico is slated to receive $82 billion, Natalie Jaresko said. She said the funds will help the struggling economy rebound but warned that gains will be short-lived unless there are tax and labor reforms. “It continues to be absolutely critical,” she said of the reforms, which she did not specify. “We may have lost a window of opportunity.” Jaresko met with reporters to outline a new fiscal plan for the U.S. territory, which has been in a recession for 12 years and is trying to restructure part of its more than $70 billion in public debt. The board is scheduled to approve the new plan Tuesday, although it’s unclear whether the island’s government supports it. Christian Sobrino, the government’s representative on the board, said officials are reviewing a draft of the plan and will announce their position during Tuesday’s public hearing. Government officials have previously rejected portions of the original plan. “This administration has faced a fiscal crisis and two hurricanes without precedent,” Sobrino said. “The actions our government has taken reflect an abundance of will to do what is necessary to transform Puerto Rico. Labeling policy differences as a lack of political will is not prudent.” The revised five-year fiscal plan, which serves as an economic blueprint for the island, anticipates a 6 percent increase in revenues and a 7 percent decrease in expenditures for this fiscal year. Jaresko said Puerto Rico also could see a $17 billion surplus if it reaches a settlement with those who bought sales tax bonds issued by the local government. The agreement with creditors finalized last week represents nearly 24 percent of the island’s debt, and officials expect the deal to be presented next month to a judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process for Puerto Rico agencies. The fiscal plan does not contain any overhauls to Puerto Rico’s tax and labor systems, which Jaresko said are needed to help the economy rebound. She said the government has to improve the ease of doing business on the island as well as create a more competitive labor market and transition employees from the informal economy to the formal one. Puerto Rico legislators are still debating a tax reform bill that the board has said does not meet the need for a broader, more progressive tax regime. Jaresko also warned the island would face long term deficits if the local government does not make the economy more competitive. “To change long term, more hard work remains,” she said.",https://apnews.com/e98583e243f54807a268822845455dfc,AP,Neutral
Whitefish Energy gets US contracts after Puerto Rico ouster,MICHAEL BIESECKER,10/9/18,"A year after losing a $300 million no-bid contract to restore Puerto Rico’s hurricane-shattered electric grid, Whitefish Energy Holdings has quietly been seeking and winning U.S. government contracts. Founded in 2015 in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s tiny Montana hometown, Whitefish had just two employees when Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. The company was ousted weeks later by Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority amid concerns about the slow pace of recovery and eyebrow-raising charges that included electrical linemen hired at a rate of more than $300 per hour. Records show that in June Whitefish won a $225,000 job from the Interior Department to perform electrical work at three fish hatcheries in the state of Washington. In September, the Energy Department awarded Whitefish a more than $1 million contract to build power transmission lines in Missouri and Arkansas. The Interior Department denied this week that Zinke, a former Montana congressman, played any role in the contract award. The department acknowledged last year that Zinke knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski and that the secretary’s son had a summer job at one of the company’s construction sites. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Gavin Shire said the contract was administered at the regional level “per our standard policies and procedures.” “It was a competitive contract awarded on the basis of the lowest cost, technically acceptable bid,” Shire said. The Energy Department also said its contract awarded to Whitefish by the federal Southwestern Power Administration was routine. “Prior to the awarding of the contract, SWPA conducted all necessary and proper due diligence,” said Elizabeth Nielsen, spokeswoman for the Southwestern Power Administration. “The review did not produce any concerns that would prevent SWPA from awarding the contract to Whitefish, the lowest bidder.” Records show the Energy Department previously awarded Whitefish similar construction contracts in 2016 and 2017 totaling about $1.5 million. After Whitefish’s ouster following the hurricane, members of Congress from both parties excoriated Puerto Rican officials over their handling of the $300 million contract, which they said led to outsized profits for the company. The head of the island’s power authority was forced to resign. The company on Tuesday defended its record. “Whitefish Energy was the first to arrive on the island ... for what was immediately clear would be a daunting task,” said Dan Wilson, a company spokesman. “We are grateful that the accurate record of our work in Puerto Rico is coming to light, even as our hearts remain with those on the island who are still struggling.” ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",https://apnews.com/5a0bcba48f87408582794ffb8ab3255c/Whitefish-Energy-gets-US-contracts-after-Puerto-Rico-ouster,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor endorses Democrats in Florida,MIKE SCHNEIDER,10/1/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor endorsed the Democratic candidates in both the U.S. Senate and governor’s races, saying Monday he was impressed with incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson’s longstanding support for Puerto Rico and by gubernatorial candidate and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum’s charisma, energy and commitment. Gov. Ricardo Rosello said at a news conference that it was tough to decide on a favorite for the Senate race because he called both Nelson and his challenger, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, “two great people running for office.” But Rossello said decided to back Nelson because of the senator’s longstanding support for Puerto Rican equality when it comes to federal benefits, and his support for statehood for the island. Later in the day, Rossello backed Gillum over GOP U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis in Florida’s gubernatorial race, saying he was impressed by Gillum’s charisma when a mutual friend introduced them before the August primary. Rossello’s endorsements could sway some of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have moved to Florida in the year since Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Both Democrats and Republicans in Florida have courted the votes of Puerto Ricans, and Rossello said he was grateful for Scott’s multiple visits and aid to the island. Rossello said he and Scott had traded messages but hadn’t been able to talk to each other directly before he endorsed Nelson. “In no way, should one take this as a negative toward somebody. It’s a positive for somebody,” said Rossello after the news conference in Orlando.  “This might fall on deaf ears but we need to steer away from, in every contest, to see who the villain is and who the superhero is. In many cases, we have fine folks running for office.” About 20 Puerto Rican supporters of Scott protested outside in Orlando, waving Puerto Rican flags and signs that said, “Rossello Ungrateful” and “Do Nothing Nelson.” Miriam Ramirez, a former senator in Puerto Rico who is a Republican, said Rossello should have stayed neutral in the race. She is backing Scott. “I’m very, very disturbed our governor is now supporting a Democrat publicly,” Ramirez said. “He had promised he wouldn’t get involved. He’s gotten involved, so we’re getting involved.” Scott’s campaign on Monday released statements of support for the Florida governor from Puerto Rico’s lieutenant governor, resident commissioner to the U.S. Congress, secretary of state, Senate president and House speaker. Ahead of Rossello’s endorsement of Gillum, DeSantis’ campaign released a statement of support from Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon, Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner to the U.S. Congress, who said, that Gillum “has done nothing for the island of Puerto Rico.” DeSantis was championed in the Florida GOP gubernatorial primary by President Trump, who last month was criticized by some Puerto Ricans for saying the death toll from Hurricane Maria was inflated and that the number rose to 3,000 “like magic.” At a rally in Kissimmee, Florida with Rossello, Gillum, using a Spanish term for Puerto Ricans, told the crowd of about 75 supporters, “I’m here to ask to be the candidate for governor who is the candidate choice of the Boriquas, right here in the state of Florida.” Even though Rossello endorsed Gwen Graham over Gillum in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, the Puerto Rican governor said Monday that he was impressed with Gillum’s charisma when a mutual friend introduced them before the August primary. The friend had told Rossello that Gillum was “algo especial,” or something special, Puerto Rico’s governor recounted to the crowd. “As I opened the door to my office when Mayor Gillum was coming in, it was like energy just flew over the room,” said Rossello, who added that he didn’t think Gillum had a chance since he was trailing in the polls.  “Then, of course, it happened. That hope, that commitment to change galvanized the polls.” __ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP",https://apnews.com/0e02b3063ff04469b60913f4597a4442/Puerto-Rico-Gov.-endorses-Nelson-in-Florida-senate-race,AP,Neutral
Exclusive: Puerto Rico open for tourists despite 'mixed-bag' recovery - governor,Jessica Resnick-Ault,9/27/18,"ult, Nick Brown6 Min ReadNEW YORK () ,Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello flew to New York this week on a mission: persuade potential tourists that the hurricaneravaged island was ready for their return. FILE PHOTO: Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello delivers remarks during a commemorative event organized by the local government a year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, in San Juan, Puerto Rico September 20, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaBut Puerto Rico’s recovery from last year’s Hurricane Maria has been a “mixed bag,” Rossello told  on Thursday, acknowledging that the bankrupt U.S. territory, while improving, is far from out of the woods. Puerto Rico has received only a small fraction of the federal funding it needs to get back on its feet, Rossello said in a 75minute interview, and getting access to the rest could take more than a decade. His administration estimates that fixing Puerto Rico fully will require $139 billion, but the federal government has earmarked only about $60 billion to $65 billion for the recovery, he said. Of that, only about $3 billion to $4 billion has actually flowed into the island’s coffers. Obtaining the remainder could take 10 to 11 years, he said, adding that his team is lobbying the U.S. Congress for more money. Compounding the problem is Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy in U.S. federal court, where it is trying to restructure $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. There are also ongoing spending disputes between the government and a federally appointed fiscal oversight board. In the year since Hurricane Maria, Rossello has at times been diplomatic regarding the federal government’s response, while at other times – especially lately ,adopting a more critical take. He has also been criticized for sticking with an estimated death toll of 64 earlyon, when strong evidence suggested it could be higher. A governmentcommissioned study by researchers at George Washington University eventually pegged the toll at around 3,000. When asked whether his administration’s messaging strategies have been tied to an effort to maintain good relations with President Donald Trump, Rossello said a “critical part” of the island’s recovery “is making sure the federal government responds to our petitions. ”“So yes, I have opted for a path that involves dialogue, that involves collaboration,” Rossello said, adding that he has not been afraid to be critical. If Trump does not sign the island’s request to extend the federal government’s 100 percent coverage of repair costs, “I’ll be the first one to fight it,” Rossello said, “and I’ll be the first to point out that action, or lack of action, is one of the main obstacles to our recovery. ”Rossello said Puerto Rico still has as many as 60,000 homes with temporary tarp roofs. It also has hundreds of thousands of informally constructed homes with many owners lacking title to their property. Rebuilding will require the current ranks of about 45,000 construction workers to grow to 130,000, according to Rossello, who recently signed an executive order increasing the minimum hourly construction wage to $15 despite opposition from the oversight board and the private sector. POWER SHIFTThe island’s government is still considering initiatives that could make the island’s troubled electricity grid more resilient, Rossello said. Ultimately, the island hopes to generate 40 percent of its electricity from renewables and steer away from fossil fuels. The shift would require a new regulatory policy, approval by the bondholders, and, potentially, investment from outside companies or organizations. “We have received 10 to 12 unsolicited proposals for generation,” he said, while acknowledging the government has yet to find a private operator for the power utility’s transmission and distribution operations. But changes at the electric agency known as PREPA, which Rossello called one of the most troubled organizations in modern history, will be gradual. The governor said he is working with a search firm to identify outside board members for the utility, after nearly the entire board quit in an uproar over appointment of a new CEO. Limited electricity was a major problem for the island’s small business sector, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report on Thursday. A survey of more than 400 businesses with fewer than 500 employees found 77 percent suffered losses as a result of hurricanes Irma and Maria. ISLAND BECKONS TOURISTSMeanwhile, Rossello is trying not only to restore tourism, but to expand it in such a way that it incorporates hundreds of square miles of seaside and mountain communities that are largely unvisited. Puerto Rico’s tourism is small compared with other Caribbean locales and tends to be centered in San Juan. The island’s visitor lodgings hit a 2017 high of 204,025 in July, but fell to just under 30,000 in October following the hurricanes, according to Puerto Rico Tourism Company data. Convincing tourists to leave the capital, though, will require easier travel. “Puerto Rico should be a multiport destination,” he said, discussing plans to beef up airport capacity in the south and west of the island. He emphasized the possibility of capitalizing on Puerto Rico’s nearconstant spate of community festivals. “We have flower festivals, orange festivals, plantain festivals, coffee festivals, music festivals. ”Rossello pointed to socalled chinchorreos as a possible draw, events in which Puerto Rican foodies move from one inexpensive eatery to the next. “A bar crawl for food ,that’s the best way to put it,” the governor said, “and the island is small, so you start in one place and you’re on a beachfront, and 15 minutes later you’re in the mountains. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-economy-exclusive-idUSKCN1M72U3,Reuters,Neutral
Trump: No statehood for Puerto Rico with critics in office,No Author,9/24/18,"President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself an “absolute no” on statehood for Puerto Rico as long as critics such as San Juan’s mayor remain in office, the latest broadside in his feud with members of the U.S. territory’s leadership. Trump lobbed fresh broadsides at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, a critic of his administration’s response to hurricanes on the island last year, during a radio interview with Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera that aired Monday. “With the mayor of San Juan as bad as she is and as incompetent as she is, Puerto Rico shouldn’t be talking about statehood until they get some people that really know what they’re doing,” Trump said in an interview with Rivera’s show on Cleveland’s WTAM radio. Trump said that when “you have good leadership,” statehood for Puerto Rico could be “something they talk about. With people like that involved in Puerto Rico, I would be an absolute no. ”Gov. Ricardo Rossello, an advocate of statehood for the island, said Trump’s remarks had trivialized the statehood process because of political differences. “The president said he is not in favor of statehood for the people of Puerto Rico based on a personal feud with a local mayor. This is an insensitive, disrespectful comment to over 3 million Americans who live in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico,” Rossello said. He also questioned how the president of the United States could be at the U. N. General Assembly promoting democracy around the world while “in his own home there is the oldest and most populated colonial system in the world. ”Cruz responded on Twitter: “Trump is again accusing me of telling the truth. Now he says there will be no statehood because of me. ”Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative in Congress, tweeted: “Equality 4 Puerto Ricans shouldn’t be held up by one bad mayor who’s leaving office in 2020 & do not represent the people who voted twice for statehood. ”Trump’s position on statehood for the island puts him at odds with the Republican Party’s 2016 platform during its national convention, in which it declared support for Puerto Rican statehood. The president’s remarks followed his claims earlier this month that the official death toll from last year’s devastating storm in Puerto Rico was inflated. Public health experts have estimated that nearly 3,000 people died in 2017 because of the effects of Hurricane Maria. But Trump falsely accused Democrats of inflating the Puerto Rican death toll to make him “look as bad as possible. ”Trump’s pronouncements have roiled politics in Florida, which has crucial races for governor and U.S. Senate. The state was already home to more than 1 million Puerto Ricans before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island a year ago. Tens of thousands of residents fled Puerto Rico in the aftermath, with many of them relocating to Florida. The issue of statehood for Puerto Rico — or some form of semi-autonomous relationship — has divided island residents in recent years. The debate over the island’s “status” is the central feature of its politics and divides its major political parties. The federal government has said previously it would accept a change in the status of Puerto Rico if the people of the island clearly supported the decision. But for decades, Puerto Ricans have been divided between those who favor statehood and those who want to maintain the commonwealth, perhaps with some changes. A small minority continue to favor independence. The last referendum, in 2017, strongly supported statehood but opponents questioned the validity of the vote because of low turnout. Any changes would need to be approved by Congress. Statehood legislation, with support from Republicans and Democrats, was introduced in June but appears unlikely to gain momentum as politicians remain hesitant to take up such a thorny issue. ___On Twitter follow Ken Thomas athttps://twitter. com/KThomasDC",https://apnews.com/6e16c132957e484ea96437c065ccab97/Trump:-No-statehood-for-Puerto-Rico-with-critics-in-office,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico marks 1 year since Maria with song and sadness,DANICA COTO,9/21/18,"Clapping and raising their hands to the sky, hundreds of people clad in white gathered at an 18th-century fort in the Puerto Rican capital on Thursday to remember the thousands who died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria as the U.S. territory struggles to recover one year after the Category 4 storm hit. Religious leaders and government officials recalled how Puerto Rico was ravaged by the storm that killed an estimated 2,975 people and caused more than an estimated $100 billion in damage. Tens of thousands remain without adequate shelter or reliable electrical power, a sad fact that Gov. Ricardo Rossello noted on Thursday. “After that catastrophic experience, we acknowledge how complex and difficult it is to prepare for a hurricane of that magnitude and fury,” Rosello said. “The best tribute we can give these people, these brothers that we’ve lost, is to build a better Puerto Rico for their sons, their grandsons and their families.” While the U.S. government has invested billions of dollars to help clean up and repair the U.S. territory, much work remains. Major power outages are still being reported, tens of thousands of insurance claims are still pending and nearly 60,000 homes still have temporary roofs unable to withstand a Category 1 hurricane. “I think it’s inexplicable,” Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s secretary general, told The Associated Press during a visit to the island Thursday. “There’s no justifiable reason I can see for this gross level of negligence.” Across the island, people marked the one-year anniversary with gatherings large and small, solemn and anger-tinged — and at times, even hopeful. In the coastal fishing and farming village of Yabucoa, the strains of one of Puerto Rico’s most beloved songs filled the air at 6:15 a.m., the exact moment the storm made landfall there one year ago. Tarps still covered many homes that have yet to be rebuilt in the town of 37,000, even as the nostalgic strains of “Amanecer Borincano” — “Puerto Rican Dawn” — resonated at the spot where Maria first unleashed its fury. “I am the light of the morning that illuminates new paths,” a choir sang as dozens of local officials and residents gathered there. “I am the son of palm trees, of fields and rivers.” In San Juan, the crowd of worshippers gathered at the 230-year-old San Cristobal fort sang and prayed along with pastors and musicians on stage, with music echoing through the fort’s heavy walls as the sun slowly sank into the sea behind them. Pastor Elder Gonzalez said he and other volunteers who flew to Puerto Rico after the hurricane to help were shocked at what he saw from up high. “To see the island of enchantment was a deep and painful experience,” he said. “No one on the plane said a word.” Government officials argue that many changes have been made to better prepare Puerto Rico for future storms, but they acknowledge that significant obstacles remain. Jose Ortiz, director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told reporters that 20 percent of repairs made to the power grid need to be redone. He said crews didn’t have access to the best materials at the time or were forced to rely on temporary fixes, such as using trees as makeshift power polls after Maria destroyed up to 75 percent of transmission lines. In addition, municipal officials have complained that reconstruction efforts are too slow. Ariel Soto, assistant to the mayor of the mountain town of Morovis, said that 220 families there remain without a proper roof. “We’re still waiting for help,” he said. “This hit us hard.” In San Juan, among those still living under a blue tarp during the peak of hurricane season was Sixta Gladys Pena, a 72-year-old community leader. “You worry, because you think it’s going to fly off like it did before,” she said. “We’ve lost an entire year and nothing has been resolved. You feel powerless.” On Thursday, Ben Carson, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced in San Juan that $1.5 billion was being released to Puerto Rico as part of the overall $20 billion pledged for rebuilding, the largest in the agency’s history. Officials said the priority is to help people still living under tarps, as well as those in low- and middle-income housing. The money will be used to repair and rebuild homes, relocate people and help them obtain property titles if needed. “The path forward is challenging and will be measured not in months, but really in years,” Carson said. In recent weeks, Puerto Ricans have become increasingly angry and frustrated as President Donald Trump touted what he said was a “fantastic” response to Hurricane Maria, calling it an “unsung success” as he denied the official death toll without presenting any evidence. On Thursday, Trump issued a one-sentence statement on the one-year anniversary of Maria. “We stand with Puerto Rico, and we are helping them to rebuild stronger and better than ever before,” it said. Nivia Rodriguez, a 60-year-old retiree whose uncle died a week after Maria, is among those disgruntled by Trump’s comments, as well as by videos of rescue crews responding to Hurricane Florence in North Carolina. “They saved five dogs that were drowning,” she said of the rescue effort after Florence hit, adding that she feels Puerto Rico didn’t get the same treatment. “That hits you.” Like many, Rodriguez hoped that after Thursday, she would no longer be bombarded by photos and videos that make her feel like she’s reliving Hurricane Maria. “It’s too much,” she said. But others felt that Maria’s tragic legacy still needs to be acknowledged, even long after the anniversary has passed. Among them was a group of artists unveiling an exhibition called simply, “6:15 A.M.” Artist Omar Banuchi, who organized the exhibit, said he was reluctant at first, in part because he didn’t know how to approach the subject. “It’s something that affected all of us and keeps affecting us,” he said. He said the exhibition walks a fine line, with some paintings showing beautiful landscapes alongside trailers set up by Puerto Rico’s forensics institute as part of the effort to try to identify the bodies of those who perished in the storm. There also will be live music that will incorporate sounds of the hurricane hitting the island. “The point is for people to have a good time,” Banuchi said. “But there will be certain uncomfortable moments. ... Maria is still a difficult topic.” ___ For more of AP’s coverage on the anniversary of Hurricane Maria, go to: https://apnews.com/tag/HurricaneMaria’sToll",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-marias-toll-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-870349feadcf481c8dfc0caec667db9e,AP,Neutral
A look at Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria,The Associated Press,9/14/18,"In the days after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as the most destructive storm in the modern history of the island, a poll by a U.S. market research company added insult to injury. The Morning Consult survey found that nearly half of adults in the U.S. didn’t know people born in the territory, which is about 1,200 miles southeast of Florida, are American citizens by birth. But a lack of knowledge about Puerto Rico predates the storm. Here is a look at the history and key issues facing the island: THE BEGINNING The U.S. has had a fraught relationship with the island since the late 19th century. Spain ceded it to the U.S in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, and Congress declared it an “unincorporated” territory in 1917 in an act that granted U.S. citizenship to people born in Puerto Rico. At the outset, the island functioned much like a colony, with Congress allowed to overrule any local legislation and the president given power to appoint a governor. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the U.S. authorized the island to elect its own governor and draft a constitution. In 1952, it was re-christened the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and a semi-autonomous relationship was codified, establishing that the U.S. has jurisdiction over national matters such as trade and foreign relations while the island’s bi-cameral legislature and governor have control over local matters. ITS STATUS Throughout this history, the people of Puerto Rico have been split over whether they want independence, statehood or some form of the semi-autonomous relationship. The debate over the island’s “status” is the central feature of its politics and divides its major political parties. The federal government has long said that it would accept a change in the status of the Puerto Rico if the people of the island clearly supported the decision. But for decades, they have been divided between those who favor statehood and those who want to maintain the commonwealth, perhaps with some changes. A small minority continue to favor independence. The last referendum, in 2017, strongly favored statehood but opponents questioned the validity of the vote because of low turnout. The hitch is that any change would have to be approved by Congress. Statehood legislation, with support from Republicans and Democrats, was introduced in June but appears unlikely to gain momentum as politicians remain hesitant to take up such a thorny issue. SEMI-AUTONOMY IN PRACTICE Both Spanish and English are official languages on the island, but the former is more widely spoken. Puerto Ricans often refer to their island as “el pais,” the Spanish word for country. Puerto Rico fields its own Olympic team and has its own cultural identity. But Puerto Ricans can fly back and forth from the mainland without showing their U.S. passports. The more than 5 million people of Puerto Rican descent on the mainland outnumber the 3.3 million on the island. Puerto Ricans also serve in the U.S. military and many, if not most, consider themselves as American as anyone else in the country. They do have, however, second-class political status. Residents of the island cannot cast a ballot in the U.S. presidential election, have no representatives in the Senate, and send only a non-voting member to the U.S. House of Representatives. While they don’t pay U.S. personal income tax, they still must contribute for Medicare and Social Security and pay income taxes to the Puerto Rican government. DEBT CRISIS The U.S. federal government is now exerting an increased level of financial control over the island because of its debt crisis. Financial turmoil is the result of massive borrowing to cover deficits over a decade-long economic recession sparked by the expiration of a manufacturing tax credit. Congress created a financial oversight board in 2016 in exchange for granting Puerto Rico a legal mechanism to restructure public debt that had spiraled to more than $70 billion. But that proved deeply unpopular on the island, where the board’s insistence on budget and benefit cuts prompted fierce protests. HURRICANE MARIA Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a category 4 storm on Sept. 20, 2017. It bashed the island for 12 hours, destroying the electric power grid and thousands of homes, businesses and government buildings. Puerto Ricans were also left with no power and water, no cell phone service, and a sense that the U.S. government had been ill-prepared for the disaster — which the Federal Emergency Management Agency later conceded was true. Regardless of the relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the storm is proving to be an expensive disaster for all American taxpayers. The federal government says it has already spent more than $3 billion for recovery efforts. The government of Puerto Rico says the total cost of recovery over the next decade will be more than $100 billion, and it says it will need help from Congress to foot that bill.",https://apnews.com/b3ad981b7722440796960b0bbddea96f,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico bond restructuring approved in initial vote tally,Luis Valentin Ortiz,9/13/18,"Creditors overwhelmingly approved a plan to restructure bonds issued by Puerto Rico’s insolvent Government Development Bank (GDB), according to preliminary voting results announced on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: The Government Development Bank (GDB) is seen in San Juan, November 30, 2015. /Alvin Baez       The U.S. Commonwealth’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority said final results are expected on or around Sept. 19. The deal would mark the first consensual debt restructuring under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act, which aimed to rescue the island overwhelmed by $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities. Puerto Rico has been trying to restructure its debt since May 2017 through a form of bankruptcy in U.S. court and has other tentative deals with creditors that combined with the GDB agreement cover about 40 percent of its bonded debt. The next step would be final approval by Puerto Rico’s federally appointed financial oversight board and by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who the government expects will issue an order around Nov. 6. Under the deal, the GDB, which has about $4 billion of debt, would transfer to a GDB Debt Recovery Authority portions of its loan portfolios, mostly made to municipalities and public agencies, as well as its real estate assets and unencumbered cash. The authority would issue new bonds backed by a statutory lien on those assets in an amount equal to 55 percent of outstanding debt. There is pushback from a group of unsecured creditors participating in Puerto Rico’s Title III bankruptcy case over the GDB debt restructuring deal. The unsecured creditor committee, or UCC, seeks to halt the agreement, arguing it violates the commonwealth’s courtordered bankruptcy stay and PROMESA. The group also raised a flag over the deal’s release of potential claims against current and former GDB directors, officers and other representatives. The Puerto Rico government and the oversight board have rejected the committee’s arguments and intend to move forward with the GDB deal. Swain, who presides over Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases, took the arguments made by the UCC under advisement during a court hearing on Thursday. At the hearing, the UCC reminded the court of its concerns over a tentative deal to restructure Puerto Rico’s roughly $16 billion of sales taxbacked or COFINA bonds. The creditor committee, which represented the commonwealth in negotiating the COFINA settlement framework, would back out of the deal if Puerto Rico’s fiscal plan fails to update its cash flow projections in order to accommodate the terms of the deal, warned Luc Despins of Paul Hastings, the UCC’s lead counsel. The oversight board is expected to approve a revised version of the commonwealth’s fiscal plan later this month. Puerto Rico also has a preliminary debtrestructuring deal with a group of bondholders of its power utility known as PREPA, which has some $9 billion in debt. Counsel for the commonwealth’s oversight board said on Thursday it continues to hash out details with these creditors and that PREPA is pushing forward its privatization and concession plans for its generation, distribution and transmission assets. If completed, the COFINA, PREPA and the GDB deals will enable Puerto Rico to restructure 40 percent of its bonded debt, said Martin Bienenstock from Proskauer, the board’s lead counsel.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN1LT3CG,Reuters,Neutral
"Trump disputes Puerto Rico storm death toll, draws outcry",Doina Chiacu,9/13/18,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday disputed Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 3,000 from hurricanes last year and accused Democrats of inflating the figure that was reached in an independent academic study. Trump disputes Puerto Rico's death toll from Maria Trump disputes Puerto Rico's death toll from Maria01:39Trump bristled at criticism of his administration’s handling of the Puerto Rico disaster as Hurricane Florence approached the coast of North Carolina with heavy rains that forecasters warned would cause catastrophic flooding across a wide swath of the U.S. southeast. The Republican president said Democrats had inflated the number of dead in Puerto Rico “in order to make me look as bad as possible” but he did not provide evidence. The White House, while describing any death from the hurricane as “a horror,” sought to defend Trump’s handling of the disaster, saying he had “directed the entire administration to provide unprecedented support to Puerto Rico. ”“President Trump was responding to the liberal media and the San Juan mayor who sadly have tried to exploit the devastation by pushing out a constant stream of misinformation and false accusations,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement. Some wellknown Republicans split with Trump on the issue. Privately, some White House officials were exasperated with the president’s focus on Puerto Rico at a time when Hurricane Florence is bearing down on the Carolinas and other coastal areas. In a tweet, Trump said, “3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000. ”Puerto Rico was recovering from Hurricane Irma before Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017, destroying roads and bridges and leaving much of the Caribbean island without electricity for months. The death toll from Maria, the most powerful storm to hit there in almost a century, was raised last month from 64, a number widely discounted as far too low, to 2,975. Related CoverageHouse Speaker Ryan doesn't dispute Puerto Rico death tollThat number was produced by public health experts at George Washington University in Washington, D. C. , in a report commissioned by the U.S. territory’s governor, Ricardo Rossello. The study found that those deaths could be attributed directly or indirectly to Maria from the time it struck in September 2017 to midFebruary of this year. The report compared predicted mortality under normal circumstances and deaths documented after Maria. (Study: bit. ly/2wwqEqF)Rossello said Puerto Ricans “do not deserve to have their pain questioned” and backed the study. “We left this analysis to the scientists and experts, recognizing that there would be many challenges, because we wanted to have a powerful and independent voice to minimize the uncertainty,” he said in a video on Facebook. George Washington University stood by its estimate. “We are confident that the number ,2,975 ,is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date,” the school said in a statement. At the same time, the top Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, said he had no reason to dispute the official death toll, while Republican Senator Marco Rubio said tragedy should not be politicized. “I disagree with @POTUS,” Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican, said on Twitter.

Trump touted the federal government’s response as “an incredible, unsung success” this week. Thursday’s tweets drew the ire of Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan, who has sharply criticized both the president and his administration’s response to Maria. “This is what denial following neglect looks like: Mr Pres in the real world people died on your watch. YOUR LACK OF RESPECT IS APPALLING!” she wrote on Twitter before calling Trump delusional and unhinged from reality.

"Puerto Rico's death toll from Hurricane Maria raised to nearly 3,000",Steve Gorman,8/28/18,"Puerto Rico’s official death toll from Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to hit the Caribbean island in almost a century, was raised on Tuesday from 64, a number widely discounted as far too low, to nearly 3,000, based on a study ordered by the governor of the U.S. territory.

By comparison, deaths blamed on Hurricane Katrina in 2005 range from about 1,200 to more than 1,800, most along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Mississippi. The latest Puerto Rico figure was derived from comparisons between predicted mortality under normal circumstances and deaths documented after the storm, a number that turned out to be 22 percent higher. (Study on Hurricane Maria: bit. ly/2wwqEqF)Researchers said they adjusted for various factors that could account for fluctuations in mortality, most notably the displacement of some 241,000 residents who fled the island in the immediate aftermath of the storm. They also found that the poor and elderly were disproportionately hard hit in terms of risk of fatalities. The emergency response to Maria became highly politicized as the Trump administration was castigated as being slow to recognize the gravity of the devastation and too sluggish in providing disaster relief to Puerto Rico, an island of more than 3 million residents. POLITICIZED DISASTERThe storm made landfall with winds close to 150 miles per hour (241 km per hour) on Sept. 17 and plowed a path of destruction across the island, causing property damage estimated at $90 billion and leaving much of the island without electricity for months. Related CoverageWhite House backs Puerto Rico's effort to account for Hurricane Maria deadPuerto Rico death toll official estimate from Hurricane Maria rises to 2,975It was the third major hurricane to hit the United States with lethal force in less than a month last year, following Harvey in Texas and Irma in the Caribbean and Florida. The disconnect between the administration’s initial sanguine assessment of the situation and the enormity of the disaster was evident 12 days into the crisis when Elaine Duke, then acting U.S. homeland security secretary, characterized the federal response as “a really good news story” and spoke of a “limited number of deaths. ”In a scathing reaction, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz appeared on CNN declaring, “Damn it, this is not a good news story. This is a peoplearedying story. This is a lifeordeath story. ”In early October 2017, Trump expressed satisfaction with the federal response to Maria, saying it compared favorably with a “real catastrophe like Katrina. ”The storm’s death toll has remained controversial as unofficial inquiries and independent research suggested the loss of life was far higher than 64 people formally counted as having perished. Tuesday’s study, conducted by George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health and released on Tuesday, was billed as the most comprehensive yet. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration supported “efforts to ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities” from the hurricane. But U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat, said the study was “only the latest to underscore that the federal response to the hurricanes was disastrously inadequate, and as a result, thousands of our fellow American citizens lost their lives. ”FILE PHOTO: A woman looks as her husband climbs down a ladder at a partially destroyed bridge, after Hurricane Maria hit the area in September, in Utuado, Puerto Rico, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez/File Photo The second phase of the study will examine causes and contributing factors behind the deaths, said Carlos SantosBurgoa, a professor of global health who was the lead investigator of the study. SantosBurgoa said the high death toll, ranking Maria among the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, was evidence that “we lack a culture of preparedness. ” He said financial instability and a fragile infrastructure made Puerto Rico especially vulnerable to such calamities. The report was conducted in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health and commissioned by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello. Speaking at a news conference in Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan, Rossello said his government was adopting the findings as the official account of human life lost in the disaster, “even though it is an estimate. ”“We will take the 2,975 number as the official estimate for the excess deaths as a product of the hurricane,” he said. Researchers attributed undercounting of stormrelated deaths to poor communications and the lack of wellestablished guidelines and training for physicians on how to certify deaths in major disasters. In May a Harvard Universityled research team estimated that 4,645 lives were lost from Maria on Puerto Rico. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085. .

"Puerto Rico: 1,400 died from hurricane but toll still at 64",No Author,8/9/18,"Puerto Rico is estimating in a report to Congress that Hurricane Maria killed more than 1,400 people, though an island official said Thursday that the confirmed toll remains frozen at 64 pending a scientific review due out soon. The government, relying on updated statistics it first reported in June, said in a report to Congress detailing a $139 billion reconstruction plan that there were 1,427 more deaths from September to December 2017 than the average for the same time period over the previous four years. The territory’s government said that the additional deaths resulted from the effects of a storm that led to a “cascading failures” in infrastructure across the island of 3. 3 million people. The administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello stopped updating its official death toll months ago and ordered an investigation amid reports that the number was substantially undercounted. Public Safety Department Secretary Hector Pesquera said the new total will reflect the findings of the investigation, which is expected in the coming weeks. The figure of more than 1,400, Pesquera said, “is simple math” based on the number of excess deaths. “This is not the official number of deaths attributable to Hurricane Maria,” he said. Hurricane Maria, which came just two weeks after Hurricane Irma passed near enough to cause damage to the island, knocked out power and water across Puerto Rico and caused widespread flooding that left many sick and elderly people unable to get medical treatment. “The hurricanes’ devastating effects on people’s health and safety cannot be overstated,” the government said in the report seeking assistance from Congress to help rebuild an island that was already struggling from a deep economic crisis at the time of the storm. In the weeks after the storm, Puerto Rican officials said the storm directly caused 64 deaths, many in landslides or flooding. But they have also said that more people likely died due to indirect effects of the powerful storm. “We always anticipated that this number would increase as more official studies were conducted,” Pesquera said. The government commissioned an independent epidemiological study by George Washington University and the Milken Institute of Public Health that is due in coming weeks. The use of the higher death toll in the report to Congress was first reported Thursday by The New York Times. Most of the deaths occurred not in the initial storm on Sept. 20, but in the ensuing days and weeks when the island-wide electricity outage and roads blocked by downed power lines and other debris made it difficult to move around and emergency services were stretched beyond their capabilities. Government agencies have used various methods to count storm deaths over the years, with authorities generally trying to sort them into direct and indirect to include people whose deaths are tied to a natural disaster without necessarily being obviously caused by it. New York Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, has called for legislation that would establish federal standards for death counts after disaster. “It has been tragically clear for some time that the devastation from Irma and Maria was many magnitudes worse than the official death toll suggested,” she said.",https://apnews.com/1fe6c144340d4d41963fd304d569c088,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico sends costlier reconstruction plan to U.S. Congress,Reuters Staff,8/8/18,"Puerto Rico submitted a recovery plan to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday that carries an estimated price tag of $139 billion, which is 47 percent more than the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth requested in November. The economic and disaster recovery plan allocates the money to housing, water and energy systems, education, transportation, public buildings, communications, planning, municipalities, as well as to the economy and environment, according to Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office. Puerto Rico’s severe financial problems, which led to bankruptcy court in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations, were compounded by destructive hurricanes that hit the island in September. “Puerto Rico has a unique opportunity to innovate and rebuild in order to become that Puerto Rico we all want,” Rossello said in a statement. He added that the initiatives were aimed at “making us stronger and resilient, while guaranteeing a longterm economic recovery. ”Last November, Rossello requested $94. 4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island’s infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. That socalled Build Back Better plan contained a preliminary assessment of damages and an initial estimate of money the island needs to rebuild, according to the statement. The final plan, which was submitted on the deadline day set in the 2018 U.S. budget act, expanded the scope of the November request and was developed with input from federal agencies, the governor’s office said. It was also posted on the internet and subjected to public hearings prior to its submission. Nearterm priorities for the money include restoring Puerto Rico’s ailing electrical system, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria, improving emergency preparedness, and repairing public facilities. Longterm objectives include stopping emigration and boosting economic growth.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress-idUSKBN1KT2KF,Reuters,Neutral

Puerto Rico bankruptcy judge upholds oversight board powers over government,Luis Valentin Ortiz,8/7/18,"A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that Puerto Rico’s federal oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline on the bankrupt island’s government through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in law. FILE PHOTO ,Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello speaks to U.S. President Donald Trump during a working lunch with governors in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, U.S. , June 21, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico’s legislature filed lawsuits in July claiming the board, which was created by the U.S. Congress under the socalled PROMESA Act in 2016, overstepped its power by imposing a belttightening fiscal plan and budget on the government that require public policy actions. The board, which sought to dismiss the litigation, argued that if it cannot impose reforms through a fiscal plan over the objections of the governor, “then PROMESA created a toothless oversight board. ”Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the PROMESA Act gives the board the power to make “binding policy choices” for the U.S. commonwealth despite the governor’s objection. However, when it comes to policy measures dependent on the adoption of new laws or the modification or repeal of existing laws, the board “has only budgetary tools and negotiations to use to elicit any necessary buyin from the elected officials and legislators,” the ruling stated. While the ruling empowered the board in fiscal matters, it also noted that only the Puerto Rico government can pass laws necessary to implement new fiscal policies. Swain noted that the PROMESA Act is “an awkward powersharing arrangement” because Puerto Rico officials have the ability “to obstruct implementation altogether or complicate it in such a way as to cripple Puerto Rico’s ability to use it to promote the needed return to fiscal responsibility and access to capital markets. ”With Puerto Rico sinking under roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, the board in May 2017 sought a form of bankruptcy restructuring in U.S. court. Rossello blasted the ruling for giving “total budgetary authority to the unelected members of the oversight board, which supersede that of the elected officials of the Government of Puerto Rico and its legislature. ”“While we analyze the possibility of appealing the court’s decision, we will keep looking for ways to work with the oversight board so that we avoid harsh, draconian measures that would be detrimental to our people,” he said in a statement. The oversight board said the ruling upholds its authority and urged the Puerto Rico government to fully implement the fiscal plans and budgets it certified. “There can be no doubt that the fiscal year 2019 budget certified by the oversight board is the only one and must be enforced,” said Board Chairman José Carrión in a statement. “We call on all stakeholders to get back to work in the interests of Puerto Rico, in order to end decades of mismanagement and rebuild our island. ”While the judge dismissed several counts in the governor’s lawsuit largely on technical grounds, she kept other parts alive, rejecting the board’s argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Swain dismissed the legislators’ lawsuit in its entirety.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-lawsuit-idUSKBN1KS2GQ,Reuters,Neutral
US demands quick privatization of Puerto Rico power agency,DANICA COTO,7/25/18,"Federal lawmakers demanded Wednesday that Puerto Rico quickly privatize its bankrupt power company in a bid to end its turmoil and allow others to provide stable electricity in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Frustration grew as consultants and local and federal officials testified during a hearing on the management crisis at Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority held by the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources in Washington. Republican Rep. Don Young of Alaska urged the Department of Energy to set a timeline on how long it would take to privatize the U.S. territory’s power company, saying that five or 10 years is “too damn long.” “We are going to privatize this unit,” he said. “It has been a failure. Puerto Ricans deserve better.” A few hundred Puerto Ricans remain without power more than 10 months after the hurricane destroyed up to 75 percent of transmission lines. Crews are still trying to repair and rebuild the grid in the middle of this year’s hurricane season as the company struggles with a high turnover, naming its fifth director since Maria. Before testimony began, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the committee, said the objective of the hearing was the health and safety of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens. “We’re not talking about federalizing anything ... or selling assets to the highest bidder,” he said. The statement appeared to be a response to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who declined to attend the hearing. He sent a letter to Bishop saying his administration has worked hard to overhaul the company, known as PREPA, and upgrade the still fragile grid. “The transformation is a complex process, and it would be unnecessary and inappropriate for Congress to give the Department of Energy control of PREPA, effectively robbing the island of a critical resource at a perilous time for Puerto Rico,” Rossello wrote. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far allocated $6 billion for Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, although not all of it has been spent, officials said.",https://apnews.com/f3c943a57b694b26a17563f19f1a1974/US-demands-quick-privatization-of-Puerto-Rico-power-agency,AP,Neutral
University of Minnesota architects work to aid Puerto Rico,AMIE STAGER,7/14/18,"Researchers from the University of Minnesota are working with a university in Puerto Rico to change the way universities react to communities that have been affected by natural disasters. Design researchers at the University’s School of Architecture have partnered with the University of Puerto Rico to develop ways to best utilize resources to provide aid following crises. The two schools are working to develop a solar station where communities can charge their electronic devices when electricity is not available, and are hoping to send it to the island in August. Following Hurricane Maria, which struck the island in fall 2017, Jacob Mans, an assistant professor in the School of Architecture, wanted to help. Mans initiated the partnership with the hope of helping universities best utilize the resources they have to benefit impacted communities. “After Hurricane Maria, many universities converged in Puerto Rico to do everything from humanitarian work to research,” said Cecilio Ortiz Garcia, a professor from the University of Puerto Rico. In June, students and faculty from the University of Minnesota, along with other U.S. universities, traveled to Puerto Rico for a conference on how colleges can engage with communities and provide aid. “When the hurricane happened this last fall, there was a group of students in the School of Architecture who wanted to see the school have a response,” Mans told The Minnesota Daily . Mans traveled to Puerto Rico with students in March for a workshop and in June for a “Resiliency through Innovation in Sustainable Energy” conference, where they identified ways in which Puerto Ricans are solving their post-disaster infrastructure problems. Ortiz Garcia said that universities that have come to provide aid in the past have had problems with cultural awareness and sensitivity when intervening, but the groups who attended RISE are working to change how universities engage with these communities. “In terms of interventions, universities are not designed to be first responders in disasters,” said University of Puerto Rico professor Marla Perez Lugo. But universities in Puerto Rico are working to utilize the resources they can offer. Ortiz Garcia and Perez Lugo asked Mans if he and fellow researchers would take over a project that builds solar stations for the island to help as Puerto Rico struggles to provide electricity to the island following the hurricane. “These are all very commendable efforts,” Ortiz Garcia said. “It became apparent to (Perez Lugo and I) that some sort of platform could actually help universities engage in communities in a more substantial and coordinated way... allowing for a more equal distribution of university resources in situations like these.” The project, called Solar Oasis, is currently being redesigned by University of Minnesota architecture researchers. The University of Minnesota is hoping to place in the infrastructure in gathering spaces where people can charge their devices and reconnect with their communities by August. Mans and Alex Heid, an adjunct instructor in the School of Architecture, are designing the station, which is made out of an aluminum frame and fits in a crate that can convert into part of its roof. The researchers are hoping to send the completed station to Puerto Rico in August and present another station at the Minnesota State Fair. “The colleagues from the School of Architecture in Minnesota are at the forefront of rethinking what an intervention is,” Perez Lugo said. ___ Information from: The Minnesota Daily, http://www.mndaily.com/",https://apnews.com/0e079c8eb8194d9f908ad1fb9eb7f323/University-of-Minnesota-architects-work-to-aid-Puerto-Rico,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico power utility board quits, leaving leadership void",Karen Pierog,7/12/18,"ult5 Min ReadCHICAGO/NEW YORK () ,Five of the seven board members of the bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ,including its CEO, named one day ago ,resigned on Thursday, leaving the utility with no leadership amid a massive restructuring effort following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the headquarters of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) in San Juan, Puerto Rico January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez The resignations came a day after PREPA named board member Rafael DiazGranados chief executive effective July 15. But Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Thursday blasted the board for agreeing to pay DiazGranados $750,000 for the year, telling them they should lower the salary or resign, citing the poor condition of the utility. That figure surpasses the $450,000 base pay ,not including possible bonuses that would raise his salary to $900,000 ,given to CEO Walter Higgins, who resigned this week after just four months on the job. “The salary granted by the governing board of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to the new executive director is not proportional to the financial condition of PREPA, to the financial situation of the government, or to the feeling of the people who are making sacrifices to raise Puerto Rico,” the governor said. PREPA has now been through four CEOs since Hurricane Maria devastated the island last September, knocking out power to more than 1. 5 million homes and businesses as it cut across the island as a powerful Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane laid bare the already poor condition of the island’s power grid, exposing years of inadequate maintenance and rate collection. The resignations come at a time when several thousand homes and businesses still lack power, and as PREPA is well shy of the fundamental improvements needed to withstand another hurricane. But in a letter to Rossello, the resigning board members said they did not believe they have support to undertake “politically unpopular tasks” needed to change PREPA from within. PREPA Chair Ernesto Sgroi, one of those who resigned, said the board struggled to find candidates to run PREPA independently and was fortunate when DiazGranados agreed to take the position. “It will be difficult to carry that company without a strong board and strong CEO ,to effectively run that company separate from government influence ,that is the main factor in trying to transform PREPA,” Sgroi told . He added that the resignations will allow the governor to “choose board members that are more in tone with his agenda. ”Late on Thursday Rossello did just that by appointing two new board members while rejecting allegations of political interference. He named Eli Diaz, the president of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, and electrical engineer Ralph Kreil to PREPA’s board of governors. PREPA, which has more than $14 billion in liabilities and is going through a privatization process, has largely patched together its system. An exodus of residents since the hurricane has left an older population on an impoverished island. But residents have long been worried that the grid is not stable enough to withstand another storm. The current hurricane season continues through November. The U.S. Army Corps said this week it would remove three generators, which provide backup at Puerto Rico’s power plants, as soon as next week. The Corps had previously agreed to leave them in place until PREPA agreed to buy them. In their letter, the board members said that “political forces in Puerto Rico have provided a definitive statement that they want to continue to control PREPA. ”“When the petty political interests of politicians are put ahead of the needs of the people, the process of transforming the Puerto Rican electricity sector is put at risk,” they wrote. The letter was signed by PREPA Chair Sgroi, Vice Chair Edwin Irizarry, and independent board members Erroll Davis, Nisha Desai and DiazGranados, who was tapped to replace Higgins. Higgins resigned on Wednesday, effective July 14. The resignations leave Maria Palou and Christian Sobrino on the board. Palou, an employee of the executive branch in Puerto Rico, had agreed late on Wednesday to resign from the board and cede her seat to Higgins. Neither Palou nor Higgins could be reached for comment.

Puerto Rico storm evacuees spared from eviction: court order,Nate Raymond,7/3/18,"A federal judge on Tuesday extended an order preventing the eviction of hundreds of Puerto Rican families who fled the hurricaneravaged island in 2017 and have been living in hotels and motels across the United States. Judge extends FEMA aid for Puerto Rican evacuees Judge extends FEMA aid for Puerto Rican evacuees02:10The order by U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman in Worcester, Massachusetts bars the federal government for three weeks from cutting off housing assistance to people who were forced to leave their homes because of Hurricane Maria. Families will be able to remain in hotels until checkout time on July 24. Hillman’s ruling extended a previous temporary restraining order issued on Saturday that prompted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to extend the assistance program until July 5. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 with winds close to 150 miles per hour (240 kph), causing an estimated $90 billion in damage to the economically struggling U.S. territory. In Tuesday’s order, Hillman asked lawyers in the case to address to what extent he should factor in Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello’s decision not to request an extension of the program as the judge considers whether to grant the evacuees further relief beyond July 24. FEMA said in a statement it would notify hotels that the program has been extended. According to the agency, 952 displaced families are receiving aid under a program in which they are provided a voucher to seek hotel lodging. At its peak, the program assisted about 7,000 families, Keith Turi, assistant administrator of the recovery directorate at FEMA, said during a hearing on Monday. FEMA announced in May that the program would end on June 30, which would have required evacuees residing in U.S. mainland hotels to check out on Sunday. Eight Puerto Ricans, most of whom are in Massachusetts, filed a proposed class action lawsuit on Saturday, contending FEMA’s actions would violate their due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. On Saturday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from terminating the program until Tuesday night. The case was then transferred to Hillman. Critics on the island said in the weeks after the hurricane that federal agencies had responded poorly to the disaster and charged that President Donald Trump’s administration viewed Puerto Ricans as secondclass citizens, an allegation denied by federal agencies. LatinoJustice PRLDEF, an advocacy organization pursuing the lawsuit, welcomed Tuesday’s ruling, saying in a Twitter post it is “hoping to convince the judge to hold FEMA accountable for our community!”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-hurricane-lawsuit-idUSKBN1JT1R5,Reuters,Neutral
Many in Puerto Rico still under tarps as storm threat looms,BEN FOX,6/20/18,"Hurricane Maria ripped away part of the steel roof from Carmen Lidia Torres Mercado’s home in the Puerto Rican capital. Nine months later, she is still relying on a blue plastic tarp to protect her home, even with a new storm season already two weeks old. Torres points out where rain seeps into the bedroom of her small house in a San Juan neighborhood known as Barriada Figueroa, where the narrow streets surged with floodwaters during the Sept. 20 storm. But the 60-year-old retiree says she has no money to fix it on her own and doesn’t have the documents proving home ownership that she needs to qualify for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “In truth, this isn’t a suitable place to live,” Torres said in an interview at her home on a recent morning. There are thousands of people in similar circumstances across Puerto Rico nearly nine months since the most devastating storm to strike the island in decades. Blue tarps or sturdier plastic sheets installed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are still widely visible around the island, though FEMA and local government agencies say they can’t say for certain how many roofs still need to be replaced. Many people lack insurance or other resources to rebuild on their own. While the U.S. and Puerto Rican government have helped with grants and loans, they haven’t been enough on an island where nearly half the people live in poverty. Some are renters like Gabriel Figueroa, a self-employed handyman in San Juan, who said the owner of the house moved to the U.S. and hasn’t bothered to replace the roof panels that were blown away in the storm. He’s saving up the $2,000 he needs to do it himself, but isn’t there yet. “I don’t want to wait much longer,” he said. “I have kids and I have to protect them.” There has been significant progress in recovery in general. Power, water and cellphone service have been restored to more than 95 percent of Puerto Ricans. Businesses are operating and the roads are no longer free-for-alls now that many traffic lights are working again. There are signs of economic recovery, with the government reporting last week that unemployment for May was 9.6 percent, the lowest level in almost 30 years. But housing remains a challenge. Mayor Rafael Surillo of Yabucoa, the small southeastern town near where Maria made landfall, said at least 800 homes there still have temporary roofs in need of replacement.  The San Juan’s mayor’s office says there are at least 2,000 in the capital, several thousand more in the metropolitan area. So many temporary roofs remain, Surillo said, because people either can’t qualify for loans or grants — often because they don’t have the titles to their property or are missing documents — or the amount of assistance they can get isn’t enough to cover the cost of repairs. Local officials have been working with people to secure new property title documents, but it has been difficult. “The reconstruction has been extremely slow, dangerously slow,” Surillo said. FEMA, which was accepting initial applications for assistance through Monday, has had a visible presence on the island, distributing 126,000 blue tarps and coordinating the installation of sturdier, but still temporary, blue plastic sheets by the Corps of Engineers on nearly 60,000 homes. The agency said it has approved 457,000 applications for individual assistance, totaling $1.3 billion. The federal agency, however, is not set up as a replacement for homeowner’s insurance, which a significant portion of Puerto Rico lacks. Spokeswoman Jo Ann Diaz said FEMA can’t make people whole despite expectations to the contrary. “We help you until you are on the road to recovery,” she said. That reality has slowly sunk in across Puerto Rico. Doris Colon and Felix Marquez, an elderly retired couple in Catano, west of San Juan, said they received $500 from FEMA but needed much more after Maria tore off part of their roof, leaving the house exposed to days of punishing rain that damaged appliances, furniture and the floors of their small home. “If only FEMA would have given something more, I could have called somebody to help me,” the 75-year-old Colon said, noting that the family got additional help from the Puerto Rican government and a non-governmental organization that normally works in Africa. Others in their neighborhood had similar experiences. Dilma Gonzalez, 47, said she received $132 from FEMA, for damage to her roof and kitchen that a contractor said would cost at least $6,000 to repair. She had no insurance and hasn’t worked since the storm. “I’m worried because it’s already storm season and one little wind will take it all away,” she said, gesturing at her house as she chatted with neighbors on the street. Angel Santos Rivera was among the tens of thousands of FEMA applicants who got no assistance at all. The 75-year-old said he could neither read nor write, but he passed on a letter from the agency stating that he was ineligible for assistance because he could not provide sufficient proof that he owns the home where he has lived for 40 years. Upstairs, he brought out a battered file folder with the property title, missing all the pages but the one with his notarized signature. He shrugged as he talked in the shade of his balcony, the light tinged blue from the plastic sheet that protects him from the sun and rain. “It’s in God’s hands,” Rivera said. “There’s nothing you can do.”",https://apnews.com/a99551194b144db490b25c7f0e6d46fd/Many-in-Puerto-Rico-still-under-tarps-as-storm-threat-looms,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico gov signs bill to privatize power company assets,DANICA COTO,6/20/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor signed a historic bill Wednesday to privatize the U.S. territory’s troubled power company in a move many hope will help minimize power outages that have followed Hurricane Maria and stabilize the production and distribution of energy amid an 11-year-old recession. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is one of the largest U.S. public utilities, and the bill allows for the sale of its power generation plants as the company faces more than $9 billion in public debt and relies on infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average. It also allows the government to create public-private partnerships for the transmission and distribution of power as well as for services including billing and meter-reading. “We’re here to make transformational changes for Puerto Rico,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello said, adding that he believes the law will help attract more investment. “It’s no secret that Puerto Rico’s economic development has remained stagnant in recent decades.” Rossello said initial market studies have revealed “a lot” of interest in taking over the generation and distribution of power in Puerto Rico. But contracts will not be awarded anytime soon. Legislators now have 180 days to approve another measure to establish a public energy policy and regulatory framework that Puerto Rico’s Energy Commission will use as a guide to award contracts. The new law protects the jobs of the more than 6,000 people that currently work at the power company. If workers decide not to remain, they will be relocated to other government agencies, Rossello said. The Electric Power Authority became Puerto Rico’s first public corporation when it was created under a different name in 1941. The island’s power system now has a generating capacity of some 5,000 megawatts and includes six fossil fuel and seven hydroelectric generation sites and nearly 31,500 miles of distribution lines and nearly 2,500 miles of transmission lines. Imported oil accounts for 45 percent of power generation in Puerto Rico, compared with a national U.S. average of 4 percent. Renewable energy represents 4 percent of generation on the island, compared with the U.S. national average of 15 percent. Rep. Victor Pares, a member of the island’s House of Representatives, said privatizing certain assets will help boost Puerto Rico’s economy and create a more resilient power grid. “This is possibly the most important project in decades,” said Pares, who heads the House Commission for Economic Development, Planning, Telecommunications, Public-Private Partnerships and Energy. Those who oppose privatizing the power company’s assets say it doesn’t guarantee a more widespread use of renewable energy or cheaper power bills on an island where electricity costs nearly twice the average of the U.S. mainland. “This measure does not contain any guarantee of lower rates as promised by the government,” Freddyson Martinez, vice president of a union that represents power company workers, said in a phone interview. Rep. Denis Marquez, a member of Puerto Rico’s Independence Party, voted against the measure and told The Associated Press that the company should be overhauled but remain in government hands. “Energy is a human right,” he said, adding that he believes Puerto Ricans will be hit with higher power bills. The Electric Power Authority serves 1.47 million customers, with more than 4,300 of them still without power nine months after Hurricane Maria destroyed up to 75 percent of Puerto Rico’s distribution lines, causing the longest blackout in U.S. history. Crews are still repairing lines and installing new power poles as the U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Electricity works with Puerto Rico’s power company to start strengthening the grid even as the new Atlantic hurricane season has started.

His doctor prescribed an inhaler and an allergy pill for asthma, and his symptoms were mostly under control. Then Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, strewing mold-producing wreckage across the island and forcing many to use fume-spewing generators for power. The boy, now 8, started having twice-monthly attacks and needing nearly four times the amount of medicine he used to take. His mother said weekly power outages in their coastal town of Aguadilla also feed his anxiety, which can make symptoms worse. He panics about not being able to turn on the plug-in nebulizer that helps control his attacks. “The lights go out and he breaks down,” said Johana Hernandez. “He cries out, ‘The power is gone, mom! The power is gone! I’m going to have an asthma attack!’” Doctors in Puerto Rico say they are seeing an alarming rise in the number and severity of asthma cases that they attribute to destruction caused by the deadly hurricane that walloped the island in September. The chronic lung disease is caused by such things as pollution, airborne mold and pollen, all of which have increased post-Maria. “It has increased so, so, so much after the hurricane,” said Dr. Ivette Bonet, who treats low-income patients at a clinic in the working-class neighborhood of Santurce. Bonet says she has dozens of new patients who never had asthma before the Category 4 storm hit. “Now they have this cough that they can never get rid of,” she said. Puerto Rico had high rates of asthma even before the hurricane. An estimated 435,000 people on the island of 3.3 million, or 13 percent, had asthma before Maria pummeled the territory on Sept. 20, according to Puerto Rico’s Health Department. That compares to 8.3 percent who suffered from asthma on the U.S. mainland in 2016, according to the latest available figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. There are no figures for Puerto Rico in the months after Maria, though new accountings are under way. Experts say the high rates may be partly due to the relatively high humidity in the Caribbean and the poor state of housing and infrastructure because of Puerto Rico’s high poverty rate and bankrupt government. Now, towering piles of building and plant debris from the hurricane remain in many neighborhoods. Puerto Rico recorded the highest levels of mold spores in more than a decade in May, said Benjamin Bolanos, director of the San Juan Aeroallergens Station of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Heavy seasonal rains are contributing to the problem, he said. “We have never seen something like this,” Bolanos said. Generators powered by diesel or gasoline once used only in emergencies belch fumes daily at hospitals, schools and water treatment plants because the power grid remains fragile and plagued by blackouts. Many are older models that don’t meet current pollution standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waved those rules because of the power emergency, the first time it has made such an allowance, agency spokesman David Kluesner said. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Administration alone has more than 1,200 generators still operating on the island. FEMA spokeswoman Dasha Castillo said all generators run by the agency meet current federal environmental laws. Meanwhile, mold has invaded homes, especially the tens of thousands that still don’t have a proper roof. And there’s a problem with rats, mice and cockroaches, all of which can trigger an asthma attack. “There are a lot of factors that are still affecting people,” said the Health Department’s Ibis Montalvo, who heads a program that sends health workers to the homes of asthma patients. Melissa Pesante says fumes from generators worsened her 5-year-old son’s asthma and he spent nearly two weeks in a San Juan hospital. The family lives on the second floor above a home that runs a generator and across from an abandoned house where people keep dumping hurricane debris. Since the hurricane, her son has been prescribed additional medication and has attacks and trouble breathing several times a month, compared with hardly any attacks before the storm, she said. “He’s supposed to use a face mask, but he tells me, ‘I don’t like it, mom,’” and takes it off, Pesante said of the surgical mask her son is supposed to use whenever he goes outside. She’d like to eventually join relatives in Orlando or Miami in hopes that her son’s health and her finances will improve. Some asthma patients actually need generators to power their asthma treatment nebulizers, said Dr. Jorge Rosado, a pediatrician who volunteers at a clinic in the northern town of Toa Baja. That’s sometimes the case for Yadriel, whose mother has to turn on a generator if he needs treatment during a blackout. The situation is particularly bad on the islands of Vieques and Culebra, just east of Puerto Rico, that are still completely dependent on generators. Dr. Juan Manuel Roman travels to Culebra weekly and said that in addition to new patients, his regular patients are seeking treatment far more often. Roman said it’s hard to escape the fumes from all the generators that keep the tiny island energized. “They’re always going to inhale them,” he said.",https://apnews.com/article/health-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-hurricane-maria-23793064cc954c69a176cb094e6c96aa,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico issues new data on Hurricane Maria deaths,DANICA COTO,6/13/18,"Eight days after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, Efrain Perez felt a pain in his chest. Doctors near his small town sent him to Puerto Rico’s main hospital for emergency surgery for an aortic aneurysm. But when the ambulance pulled into the parking lot in the capital, San Juan, after a more than two-hour drive, a doctor ran out to stop it. “He said, ‘Don’t bring him in here, I can’t care for him. I don’t have power. I don’t have water. I don’t have an anesthesiologist,’” Perez’s daughter, Nerybelle, recalled. The 95-year-old Perez died as the ambulance drove him back to southwestern Puerto Rico but he is not included in the island’s official hurricane death toll of 64 people, a figure at the center of a growing legal and political fight over the response to the Category 4 storm that hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017. Facing at least three lawsuits demanding more data on the death toll, Puerto Rico’s government released new information on Tuesday that added detail to the growing consensus that hundreds or even thousands of people died as an indirect result of the storm. According to the new data, there were 1,427 more deaths from September to December 2017 than the average for the same time period over the previous four years. Additionally, September and October had the highest number of deaths of any months since at least 2013. But the statistics don’t indicate whether the storm and its aftermath contributed to the additional deaths. The Puerto Rican government says it believes more than 64 people died as a result of the storm but it will not raise its official toll until George Washington University completes a study of the data being carried out on behalf of the U.S. territory. The issue is clouded by the fact that the federal government and U.S. states and territories have no uniform definition of what constitutes a storm-related death. The National Hurricane Center counts only deaths directly caused by a storm, like a person killed by a falling tree. It does not count indirect deaths, like someone whose medical equipment fails in a blackout. Puerto Rico began by counting mostly direct deaths, with some indirect ones. Then it stopped updating its toll entirely while it waits for the George Washington University study, due later this summer. The death count has had political implications. Visiting Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, two weeks after the storm hit, President Donald Trump asked Gov. Ricardo Rossello what the death toll was. “Sixteen,” Rossello answered. “Sixteen people certified,” Trump said. “Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s taken place in Puerto Rico.” On Monday, two Democrats introduced a bill to the Republican-controlled Congress that would establish federal procedures for counting deaths after a natural disaster, saying that will help improve the federal response and be key to allocating federal funds. The $2 million proposed project would allow the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to hire the National Academy of Medicine to do a study on how best to assess fatalities during and after a disaster, given that the process is currently left up to U.S. states and territories. “Nobody rebuilding his or her life after a natural disaster should suffer the negligence we’ve seen in Puerto Rico,” Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona said. “Too many Puerto Rican families are suffering additional burdens today because officials won’t acknowledge their loved ones’ deaths. Like Perez, thousands of sick Puerto Ricans were unable to receive medical care in the months after the storm caused the worst blackout in U.S. history, which continues to this day, with 6,983 home and businesses still without power. The data released Tuesday showed increases in several illnesses in 2017 that could have been linked to the storm: Cases of sepsis, a serious bloodstream infection usually caused by bacteria, rose from 708 in 2016 to 835 last year. Deaths from diabetes went from 3,151 to 3,250 and deaths from heart illnesses increased from 5,417 to 5,586. The data was not broken down by month, preventing an analysis of whether the illnesses rose after Hurricane Maria. CNN and the Puerto Rico Center for Investigative Journalism sued the Puerto Rican government after it refused to release a detailed accounting of deaths in the wake of the storm. On June 5, a judge gave the government until Tuesday to release a database listing the causes of death of all those who died from two days before the storm until today, along with all the death certificates and burial and cremation certificates for the same period. “People still don’t have a clear picture as to how many lives were lost due to a lack of food, medicine, health services or simply because of an ineffective response to an emergency. That’s why it’s urgent to shed light on all components of government preparedness and response,” Judge Lauracelis Roques wrote in her ruling. The government on Tuesday requested more time to release all the death certificates, saying Social Security data had to be redacted from 48,000 individual documents. The judge rejected the request and the government planned to announce its next steps later in the day. Meanwhile, thousands of Puerto Ricans were hoping the release of the information will lead to their loved ones being included in the storm’s toll, something they say will provide a sense of closure and show the American public the true cost of the hurricane. Until now, Perez has been “one of those who do not count,” his daughter told The Associated Press. “That’s a lie.” Lucila Pardo, 96, spent nearly four months in a sweltering nursing home that did not have power and developed bed sores by the time she was moved in early January to another home where electricity had been restored. By then, the sores had become infected and she was taken to a hospital where she spent two weeks before dying of septicemia. “That figure of 64 is a lack of respect for those who died from other consequences,” said Pardo’s granddaughter Analid Nazario. “The hospital wrote a letter apologizing,” Nazario told the AP, adding that they were understaffed. A Harvard study published last month estimates there were as many as 4,600 more deaths than usual in the three months after Maria, although some independent experts questioned the methodology and the numbers in that study. Still, previous studies have found the number of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths is higher than the official toll, including a 2017 report that said there were nearly 500 more deaths than usual on the island in September. Days before the government was ordered to release the new data, Puerto Rico’s Institute of Statistics sued the demographic registrar for the information. On June 1, the agency released information showing there were an additional 1,397 deaths from September to December 2017 compared with the same period the previous year. Among those who died the first week of October was Raul Antonio Morales, a 95-year-old diabetic who didn’t have the insulin he needed because the nursing home where he lived didn’t have power or a generator, according to his granddaughter, Maytee Sanz. She said relatives tried to obtain a generator, but there was none available. A doctor at the nursing home certified that Morales died of natural causes, and he is not included in the official death toll. “I think the government has been extremely inept and inefficient regarding the statistics,” Sanz said. “There were a lot of deaths certified as natural simply because they ... were not electrocuted or did not drown, but they were a result of the hurricane. When you don’t have access to insulin or a respiratory machine, you have no way of surviving.” ____ Associated Press writer Larry Fenn in New York contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/health-puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-international-news-30ccc521c01f4c5da6a145fa4158c4dc,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico agency sues government to obtain death data,DANICA COTO,6/1/18,"Puerto Rico’s Institute of Statistics announced Friday that it has sued the U.S. territory’s health department and demographic registry seeking to obtain data on the number of deaths following Hurricane Maria as a growing number of critics accuse the government of lacking transparency. The lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello told CNN there would be “hell to pay” if officials don’t release mortality data. Puerto Rico’s Health Department released some information Friday, saying an additional 1,397 overall deaths were reported from September to December in 2017, compared with the same period the previous year. However, officials did not provide causes of death for any of the 11,459 total people deceased during the period. The institute’s director, Mario Marazzi-Santiago, told The Associated Press that he was pleased with the information released, but that the lawsuit will continue because officials have not released details of each individual death. Many believe the official toll of 64 deaths is a severe undercount, and anger is building across the island as the families of victims seek answers. “We demand that they tell us everything,” said Lucy Landro, who lives on the island of Vieques off Puerto Rico’s east coast and lost her elderly uncle after the hurricane hit. “People should know the reality that all towns are facing. We in Vieques aren’t the only ones who are suffering.” Marazzi-Santiago said the information requested should be public and is urgently needed so Puerto Rico’s government can help prevent deaths in the event of another storm, noting that the Atlantic hurricane season began on Friday. “We want to make sure that when the next hurricane arrives, we don’t have a repeat of this situation,” he said. He said the institute previously won a similar lawsuit it filed in 2010 to obtain mortality data from the health department amid accusations that the government was not properly counting or classifying overall deaths. “Given the doubt that has arisen around the world...we recommend a higher level of transparency,” Marazzi-Santiago said. Government officials have previously said they cannot release mortality data post-Maria because it is under review as ordered by the governor. On Friday afternoon, Demographic Registry Director Wanda Llovet said in a statement that her office is being transparent and that not all information is public because they have to protect people’s privacy. Her office said there was a 24 percent increase in overall deaths in September 2017 compared with the same month the previous year, along with a 29 percent increase in October 2017 and an 8 percent increase in November 2017. A Harvard study published earlier this week estimates that there were up to 4,600 more deaths than usual in the three months after Hurricane Maria, although some independent experts questioned the methods and the number in that study. Previous studies have found that the number of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths is higher than the official toll, including a 2017 report that said there were nearly 500 more deaths than usual on the island in September. A spokeswoman for the island’s health department, which oversees the demographic registry, did not respond to a message for comment. In February, Puerto Rico’s governor said a team of experts at George Washington University would lead an independent review to determine the number of deaths caused by Maria. A preliminary report was due in May, but the team was granted more time.",https://apnews.com/7d19e956de344d7188c79b455c0315f6/Puerto-Rico-agency-sues-government-to-obtain-death-data,AP,Neutral
"As storm season starts, AP photographer revisits Puerto Rico",RAMON ESPINOSA,6/1/18,"Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa spent weeks roaming Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island last September. He documented the lives of Puerto Ricans who lost roofs and possessions in the storm. Others saw their houses torn completely from their foundations, leaving only concrete bases. Espinosa revisited the subjects of his pictures ahead of the June 1 start of the 2018 hurricane season to see how they were living eight months after the disaster. He found some well along the path to recovery — erecting concrete homes after wood houses were swept off by Maria’s winds. Others are half-recovered: A 69-year-old woman living on federal assistance has new walls but a fragile metal roof that is screwed on to wood planks and certain to fly away in the next major storm. Others lost everything and have no recovery in sight, including a couple who sold the car where they were sleeping after the storm so they could outfit a narrow sleeping space behind a parent’s damaged home in Puerto Rico’s central mountains. Across Puerto Rico, tens of thousands of homes still don’t have roofs. FEMA distributed 59,000 enormous plastic sheets to homeowners who lost their roofs in Irma or Maria. More than 100,000 more received smaller tarps to protect specific rooms or belongings. Only 21,000 households have received federal aid to carry out permanent repairs. FEMA officials say that longstanding rules prevented federal officials from granting reconstruction aid to storm victims who don’t have title to homes. In many such cases, storm victims were informally given property by a relative or inherited without a will or deed. Officials say those rules are being loosened so victims can prove ownership with proof such as a long history of paying utility bills. Maria completely destroyed Roberto Figueroa Caballero’s home and dozens of others in La Perla, a seaside neighborhood of San Juan made famous by the Luis Fonsi hit “Despacito.” Figueroa works in a pizzeria, lives in a rented apartment and hopes to rebuild his home, but says the Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected his application for construction aid twice, saying he does not qualify. Figueroa is appealing. La Perla is a shantytown of about 350 people built more than a century ago on a narrow strip of Atlantic shoreline between the crashing waves and the towering walls of Old San Juan. For years the neighborhood had a dark reputation fueled by a self-described hit man turned federal witness saying the bodies of many people killed in La Perla were tossed into the sea so sharks would eat them. Then came “Despacito.” Puerto Rican singers Fonsi and Daddy Yankee chose the slum as a backdrop for their video, which YouTube said attracted a record 3 billion views, and tourists began to pour in. That slowed dramatically after the storm and is only just beginning to recover. When Maria hit, Arden Dragoni was living with his wife Sindy, three children and dog Max in the town of Toa Baja. Today, Dragoni is hunting for work and has separated from his wife, who is living with their children in a FEMA-subsidized apartment. “The hurricane brought us many calamities but I learned to value my family from my heart,” Dragoni says. Juana Sostre Vazquez saw her wooden home off its foundation in the central mountain highlands. Living on food stamps and Social Security payments, the 69-year-old grandmother rebuilt with the help of her son-in-law and $14,000 in FEMA reconstruction aid. She said her metal roof is nailed onto wooden two-by-fours because she couldn’t afford to build stronger hopes the next hurricane won’t send it flying. “The money didn’t let us do the roof,” she said. “I’m doing it little by little as I save a couple of dollars.” William Fontan Quintero and his wife Yadira Sostre saw their home destroyed when Maria passed over the San Lorenzo neighborhood in the town of Morovis. The couple says FEMA rejected their application for financial help but they received $8,000 from family to replace their belongings, which they invested in wood to build a small home where they live with their two college-age children. The roof is a plastic tarp while they wait for their application to FEMA to be approved so they can finish rebuilding. “We don’t have time to build anything safe without help,” Quintero said. Luis Cosme, a worker at a cleaning company, felt the high winds as Maria neared and ran to the shelter at the Catholic church building. In the morning he came out and saw his house gone. “Thank God I am alive!” he said. Blanca Rivera and Eduard Rodriguez slept in their car after Maria destroyed their home in San Lorenzo. The couple says FEMA rejected their request for financial help to rebuild, so they sold their car to build a room next to his mother’s house. “It’s sad,” Rodriguez says. “So sad.”",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-marias-toll-puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-hurricane-maria-6a0ce87e1f3c40488be2fe8eb5552309,AP,Neutral
Official: 2 more months to restore power in Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,5/31/18,"It could take up to another two months to fully restore power in Puerto Rico as crews across the U.S. territory prepare to strengthen its electrical grid amid a new hurricane season, the power company director told The Associated Press on Thursday. Walter Higgins, the new CEO of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, said the company just awarded a $500 million contract to Florida-based MasTec to help with power restoration efforts and plans to build a better, more efficient grid. Another $900 million contract was recently awarded to Cobra Energy, and a third contract is still being finalized, he said. “We all wish we were further along,” he said of efforts to restore power to the more than 11,000 customers who remain in the dark more than eight months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm. Higgins estimated it could take $5 billion to $8 billion to strengthen the grid and said the islands of Vieques and Culebra would be first places where the grid would be built to modern standards, starting within four months. This would include installing new poles, wires and transformers as well as smart meters and renewable power sources for an estimated $150 million to $160 million. He said it will take years to modernize and strengthen Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, and that it’s too early to say what will happen if and when the power company or its operations are privatized. The island’s Senate approved a bill late Wednesday that would allow for the privatization of assets of the Electric Power Authority, which carries $9 billion in public debt and relies on infrastructure nearly three times older the industry average. The bill has not yet been signed by the governor. “The Senate is starting to modernize Puerto Rico’s electrical system, a process that should have started years ago,” said opposition Sen. Eduardo Bhatia. Higgins said he feels it would be best to privatize the generation of energy and then award one concession for transmission and distribution. If a company were to simply buy the Electric Power Authority, the federal government has the right to demand it be repaid for the more than $3.8 billion it has invested so far in reconstruction efforts, he said, adding that the U.S. government has agreed to pay for all emergency power restoration efforts for another three months. In addition, private utilities cannot get federal aid in the wake of a natural disaster, and if a company were unable to deal with storm-related losses, it could claim bankruptcy, Higgins warned. “Puerto Rico was lucky that with this disaster, it was able to get the aid,” he said. “This is working out both opportunistically and financially. ... If you’re going to have to have this crisis, this is probably the way it should happen. I hate to say that.” Going forward, Puerto Rico should start relying more on liquefied natural gas, which in turn would lead to lower power bills, Higgins said. Power bills in the U.S. territory are roughly twice the average of those in the U.S. mainland, although the island has been reducing its dependence on petroleum. Higgins said that while coal is currently the cheapest resource to power Puerto Rico, he is not in favor of it. The power company is now finalizing plans to prepare for the Atlantic hurricane season that starts June 1. Higgins said there is still work to be done to finalize mutual aid agreements, which he said should have been done two months ago. Puerto Rico’s government has been sharply criticized for not activating those agreements until more than a month after Hurricane Maria, which then allowed crews from the U.S. mainland to help restore power on the island.",https://apnews.com/3ab8b304fbd84c929eccf116a8031c25,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico grid ‘teetering’ despite $3.8 billion repair job,MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN,5/31/18,"After months of darkness and stifling heat, Noe Pagan was overjoyed when power-line workers arrived to restore electricity to his home deep in the lush green mountains of western Puerto Rico. But to his dismay, instead of raising a power pole toppled by Hurricane Maria, the federal contractors bolted the new 220-volt line to the narrow trunk of a breadfruit tree — a safety code violation virtually guaranteed to leave Pagan and his neighbors blacked out in a future hurricane. “I asked the contractors if they were going to connect the cable to the post and they just didn’t answer,” said Pagan, a 23-year-old garage worker. After an eight-month, $3.8 billion federal effort to try to end the longest blackout in United States history, officials say Puerto Rico’s public electrical authority, the nation’s largest, is almost certain to collapse again when the next hurricane hits this island of 3.3 million people. “It’s a highly fragile and vulnerable system that really could suffer worse damage than it suffered with Maria in the face of another natural catastrophe,” Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. Another weather disaster is increasingly likely as warmer seas turbocharge the strongest hurricanes into even more powerful and wetter storms. Federal forecasters say there’s a 75 percent likelihood that the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, which begins Friday, will produce between five and nine hurricanes. And there’s a 70 percent chance that as many as four of those could be major Category 3, 4, or 5 hurricanes, with winds of 111 mph (179 kph) or higher. “It’s inevitable that Puerto Rico will get hit again,” said Assistant Secretary Bruce Walker, head of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity, which is planning the long-term redesign of the grid run by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Despite the billions plowed into the grid since Maria hit on Sept. 20, 2017, Puerto Rican officials warn that it could take far less than a Category 4 storm like Maria to cause a blackout like the one that persists today, with some 11,820 homes and businesses still without power. “The grid is there, but the grid isn’t there. It’s teetering,” said Hector Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s commissioner of public safety. “Even if it’s a (Category) 1, it is in such a state that I think we’re going to lose power. I don’t know for how long.” Federal officials and Puerto Rican leaders blame decades of mismanagement that left the island’s power authority more than $9 billion in debt after declaring bankruptcy last year. Expensive projects were launched then cancelled. Politicians approved cheap power for well-connected corporations. By the time Maria hit, wooden power poles were rotted, transmission towers had rusted through and overgrown trees menaced thousands of miles of power lines. In many places across Puerto Rico, federal emergency funds allocated in the aftermath of the disaster made up for years of neglected maintenance, replacing decaying infrastructure with tens of thousands of new poles and hundreds of miles of power lines rushed from the U.S. mainland at a steep premium. But in other areas, crews without adequate supplies patched together damaged poles and power lines in a desperate push to restore power. In the western highlands, power cables were spliced together and woven haphazardly through trees in blatant violation of basic safety codes. In Pagan’s town of Cain Alto and at least one other location, trees were used as makeshift power poles in the absence of proper equipment. “We patched things up. We worked with the little material that was available and we recycled material. We took the 1,000 feet of wire that was on the ground and we strung it up in another area,” one power authority worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from management. “We took the post that had fallen over or broken and we put it up somewhere else. A lot of the work is defective.” Fredyson Martinez, vice president of the power authority workers’ union, said he estimates that roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of the repair work done over the last eight months did not meet basic quality standards. “The logistics were terrible. I give it an F,” he said. “Things need to be fixed.” Federal and Puerto Rican officials are preparing for another catastrophe that cuts power for weeks or months. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is leaving some 600 generators installed in key sites such as hospitals and water pumping stations, more than six times the number before Maria. FEMA has stockpiled 5.4 million liters of water and more than 80,000 tarps, and is distributing them and other emergency supplies to towns across the island so they will be in place for the next disaster. Power company director Walter Higgins told The Associated Press that crews also are preparing to strengthen the power grid, a project he estimates will take years and could cost between $5 billion to $8 billion. He said that within four months, crews in the nearby islands of Vieques and Culebra will start building the grid to modern standards. Still, few people believe Puerto Rico is truly ready. “If a hurricane comes tomorrow it will leave the island completely without power again,” said Juan Rosario, a community activist and former member of the power authority’s board of directors. Up to 4,645 more deaths than usual occurred in Puerto Rico in the three months after Maria, contends a new study published this week by the New England Journal of Medicine, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll of 64. Officials now are warning Puerto Ricans to stockpile enough emergency supplies to survive as long as 10 days without help. Tens of thousands of homes still don’t have roofs. FEMA distributed 59,000 enormous plastic sheets to homeowners who lost their roofs in Irma or Maria. More than 100,000 more received smaller tarps to protect specific rooms or belongings. Only 21,000 households have received federal aid to carry out permanent repairs. Juana Sostre Vasquez’s wooden house in the central highlands was ripped off its foundation by Maria. With the help of a son-in-law, the 69-year-old rebuilt, using cinderblocks and cement bought with $14,000 in FEMA reconstruction aid. Her roof is metal sheeting nailed onto wooden two-by-fours because she couldn’t afford to build stronger. She says she’s hopeful the next hurricane won’t send that sheeting flying. “The money didn’t let us do the roof,” she said. “I’m doing it little by little as I save a couple of dollars.” Mike Byrne, the head of FEMA’s Caribbean office, says he expects the federal government will eventually have spent a total of $17.5 billion in emergency funds on fixing the hurricane damage and making Puerto Rico’s grid more resilient to future storms. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ended its power restoration work in May, so future funding is expected to pass through Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power company. After receiving $945 million in federal funds for repairs to the island’s electric grid, Oklahoma-based Mammoth Energy Services announced Monday that the power authority had awarded its subsidiary, Cobra Energy, another $900 million to finish the job and begin fortifying the grid against future storms. In addition, Higgins said that a $500 million contract was just awarded to Florida-based MasTec for the same purposes, and that a third contract is being finalized. Last week, Cobra’s crews were working to rebuild one of a pair of 230-kilo-volt transmission lines climbing from Puerto Rico’s main power plants on its southern coast across high mountains to the main users of energy in the capital, San Juan, and other industrial sites and population centers in the north. Because of a decision years ago to stretch the island’s main transmission lines through a narrow path across the rugged mountains, one of the transmission lines must be turned off so its powerful current doesn’t energize equipment and workers laboring a few feet away. Cobra transmission director Alan Edwards had more than 50 linemen working on the repair, at nearly $4,000 per worker per day in federal funds from the Puerto Rico power authority, when he got the call to stop. A flaw was causing a transmission line to overheat dangerously elsewhere in the system, so the line alongside where Edwards’ men were working would have to be returned to service, forcing the crews to stop for at least the rest of the day. “Maybe we’re back at it tomorrow, I don’t know. May be next week before we can get back out there,” Edwards said. The already staggering reconstruction costs will rise by billions more if another hurricane hits. And many billions worth of those federally funded improvements could eventually pass into private hands: Puerto Rico’s Senate could approve the sale of much of the island’s power grid to a private power company or companies as early as this week. The potential sale won’t affect the federal government’s decision to spend billions of dollars on repairing and improving the grid, said Byrne, the head of FEMA’s operations in the Caribbean. “I can’t wait, because these are U.S. citizens that are at risk. U.S. citizens deserve every ounce of effort that I can bring to this, and that’s what they’re going to get,” Byrne said. ____ Michael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein",https://apnews.com/fa210cd1434c4d909e6030c7da884bce/Puerto-Rico-grid-'teetering'-despite-$3.8-billion-repair-job,AP,Neutral
"Study hikes Puerto Rico's Hurricane Maria death toll to 4,645",Gene Emery,5/29/18,"Hurricane Maria claimed the lives of 4,645 people in Puerto Rico last year and not the 64 long pegged by the island’s government as the official death toll, according to a survey of thousands of residents by a research team led by Harvard University. Study puts Puerto Rico hurricane deaths at 4,645 Study puts Puerto Rico hurricane deaths at 4,64501:48The researchers estimated that most victims of the storm died between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, as a direct or indirect result of Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in 90 years. Onethird perished because of delayed or interrupted medical care. While cautioning that the estimate of 4,645 victims may be too low, the researchers said the numbers “underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico. ”The tally, reported online on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, is likely to be controversial because it is far higher than previous independent estimates. The emergency response to the disaster became highly politicized and provoked criticism of President Donald Trump, who was faulted when much of the U.S. territory remained without power for months. Puerto Rico’s government released a statement on Tuesday welcoming the study and saying it would analyze it further. In the aftermath of the storm, Puerto Rico commissioned George Washington University to conduct an independent study into the death toll, the results of which are due soon. “As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,” Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in the government statement. The chief author of the new study, Caroline Buckee of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, did not respond to emails requesting comment. Slideshow ( 3 images )Maria, a major hurricane with winds close to 150 miles (241 km) per hour, caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to an island already struggling economically and many residents have subsequently left. There is a wide margin for error in the study authored by Buckee. While the researchers estimated 4,645 deaths, the actual number could be as low as 793 and as high as 8,498, the study showed. The tally of 4,645 dead is more than four times higher than a December estimate by the New York Times, which said the actual death toll was probably about 1,052. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085. The Buckee team randomly conducted inperson surveys of 3,299 of the estimated 1. 1 million Puerto Rican households earlier this year, making sure to include remote areas. Respondents were not paid and were asked if a household member had died directly or indirectly as a result of the storm. Missing people were not counted as deaths. Respondents were also asked about deaths within a 5minute walking distance of their homes. The Buckee team also said that in the aftermath of the storm households went, on average, 68 days without water, 84 days without electricity and 41 days without cell phone coverage. In the most remote areas, 83 percent of the households were still without power by Dec. 31.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-casualties-idUSKCN1IU2HG,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico, oversight board reach deal on fiscal plan",Reuters Staff,5/21/18,"Puerto Rico and its federally appointed oversight board have reached a deal to avoid litigation over muchneeded economic overhauls in the bankrupt U.S. territory. Governor Ricardo Rosselló and the island’s legislature agreed to repeal protections that make it difficult for privatesector employers to fire workers at will, in hopes of spurring onisland hiring, Rossello said in a statement Sunday night. In return, the board will not push to eliminate Christmas bonuses or reduce sick days, the statement said. In a separate statement Monday morning, the board said it planned to revise accordingly the island’s fiscal turnaround blueprint, which Rossello had opposed, avoiding litigation over its implementation.

Corps leaving Puerto Rico with hurricane recovery unfinished,CARLOS GIUSTI and MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN,5/18/18,"The Army Corps of Engineers is ending its work to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electric grid, despite residents’ fears that the island’s government won’t be able to restore power on its own to more than 16,000 people who remain blacked out eight months after Hurricane Maria. The federal agency will keep operating more than 700 generators on the island, including three “mega generators” supplementing Puerto Rico’s aging and storm-damaged power plants. But on Friday the restoration of thousands of miles of downed power lines will be handed back to the U.S. territory’s bankrupt public utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA. The Corps took over power restoration efforts in Puerto Rico on Sept. 30 after PREPA failed to call in mainland utility companies under a disaster response plan known as mutual aid, in which power companies from around the U.S. send staff to help stricken areas. Puerto Rican officials said 98.86 percent of PREPA’s customers had electricity Thursday, but 16,723 remained without power as the longest blackout in U.S. history continued. Trump administration officials say a big federal presence is no longer needed to hook up the relatively few remaining connections in the often-remote areas where people are still without power. But many people on and off the island are dissatisfied by the decision to pull out the Corps without Puerto Rico’s power fully restored. “It’s not in our culture to walk away from a mission when it hasn’t been fully accomplished, but we follow orders,” Charles Alexander, the Corps’ director for contingency operations, told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at a May 8 hearing. The Corps has operated under the orders of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which says it has deferred to Gov. Ricardo Rossello’s requests on the extent and duration of federal assistance to Puerto Rico. FEMA on Thursday indefinitely extended the Corps’ power generation mission but did not extend the grid repair work because Rossello did not request that. Most of those still without power live in the town of Yabucoa, which was the first place in Puerto Rico struck by Hurricane Maria on Sept. 20. Alberto Rodriguez, a 65-year-old retiree, has solar panels and a diesel generator supplying power to the house where he takes care of his wife, who is confined to bed after suffering a stroke a month after the hurricane. “I’m very worried because we are still without power. We’ve been using these generators for so long, at any moment they might fail,” he said. “I don’t think they should leave before completing the work because there are people here still waiting for electricity.” The Corps of Engineers has received more than $2 billion to restore power to Puerto Rico, overseeing more than 1,200 personnel on the ground and more than 1,000 contractors, with more than 650 of them working directly on distribution and transmission lines. Contractors included Fluor Corp., an Irving, Texas company that obtained two contracts worth a total of $1.3 billion. The Corps helped energize some 80 percent of transmission lines and nearly 90 percent of distribution lines across Puerto Rico, erecting more than 52,000 power poles and stringing more than 5,700 miles of wire. Corps contractors planned to work in the northern cities of Arecibo, Bayamon and Caguas and the southern city of Ponce through the end of Friday. A group of Corps officials plans to remain in Puerto Rico for several weeks to demobilize contractors and hand logistic operations back to FEMA and PREPA. Besides the residents of Yabucoa, hundreds of people don’t have power in the central town of Comerio, where Mayor Jose A. Santiago said many feel they have been forgotten. “They feel that there is no reason why they’ve been left for last,” he said. “What is painful is not the amount of people without electricity. It is the time that these people have been without power and we don’t see an articulate plan from the government, nobody seems to be worried with this. “It is so uncertain and so much suffering because, in that darkness, there is terrible sadness.” ___ Associated Press photojournalist Carlos Giusti reported this story in Yabucoa and AP writer Michael Weissenstein reported from Havana.",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-caribbean-storms-hurricanes-cba884b0d5664368a18dfe7ea1b18e75,AP,Neutral
"Board rejects Puerto Rico's proposed budget, asks governor for new one",Nick Brown,5/10/18,"Puerto Rico’s federally appointed oversight board on Thursday rejected the U.S. territory’s budget proposal for next fiscal year, saying it did not comply with a financial turnaround plan for the island approved by the board last month. In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello, the board said the budget’s expense projections were inconsistent with the turnaround plan, which is designed to be a blueprint for how Puerto Rico will recover from the twin challenges of bankruptcy and September’s Hurricane Maria. The board directed Rossello to submit a compliant budget by May 15, saying it needed “substantial revisions and additional information . . . before it could approve the government’s proposed budget and submit it to the legislature. ”Puerto Rico has $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt it cannot pay, the biggest insolvency in U.S. government history. The board on April 19 approved a fiscal turnaround plan that included pension cuts and labor reforms, which Rossello has said he will refuse to implement. The plan forecasts about $6. 7 billion in debt payment ability for Puerto Rico through fiscal year 2023. But Rossello’s proposed budget does not allocate for debt service, while including other expenses that are not in the plan. Among them were $100 million in municipal spending and a reserve fund that is $130 million higher than the one in the plan, according to the board’s letter. If Rossello refuses to implement parts of the plan, the board could sue for enforcement, putting yet another piece of the embattled island’s financial future in the hands of a judge. The board took issue with earlier comments from Puerto Rican officials accusing it of failing to consult with the government on a timeline for budget development. “From December 2017 to April 2018, the oversight board shared more than seven letters on the topic with various government officials” and “met in person dozens of times with” officials, the board claimed. A government spokesman said Rossello’s administration planned to respond to the letter.",https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-budget-idUSL1N1SH2O7,Reuters,Neutral
Thousands in Puerto Rico march to protest austerity measures,DANICA COTO,5/1/18,"Thousands of Puerto Ricans marched Tuesday to protest pension cuts, school closures and slow hurricane recovery efforts as anger grows across the U.S. territory over looming austerity measures. The Labor Day protest attracted teachers, retirees and unionized workers from both the private and public sectors, as well as the mayor of the capital of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz. Among those who marched through the city’s financial center before the protest grew violent was 56-year-old Juan de Dios del Valle, a government worker who was laid off in 2008 and has since found only occasional jobs as a gardener or janitor. “I’m here to support all those who are mired in poverty,” he said. The protest remained peaceful until hundreds of young protesters, many with their faces covered, threw rocks and other objects as they clashed with police who fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Several protesters and police officers received head wounds and other injuries as clouds of white smoke billowed through the Hato Rey district, where many banks and financial institutions are located. Police said several people were arrested as protesters set fire to palm tree fronds and debris including an old refrigerator. Concerns that the protest could grow violent led the island’s biggest mall to close for the day, along with several banks, government agencies and schools. Gov. Ricardo Rossello condemned the violence, saying it tarnished Puerto Rico’s reputation. “That freedom of expression cannot turn against ... the safety of human beings,” he said. Adria Bermudez, who works at Puerto Rico’s largest public university, said she was marching against the increase of the undergraduate cost per credit from $57 to $115, then to an eventual $157 over five years. She also demanded that government officials and legislators reduce their salaries instead of implement more austerity measures. “The measures are aimed at the middle class and low middle class,” she said. “The rich don’t suffer.” The march comes as Puerto Rico tries to emerge from an 11-year recession and restructure a portion of its $72 billion public debt load while recovering from Hurricane Maria. The storm caused an estimated $100 billion-plus in damage, and some 30,000 power customers remain in the dark almost eight months since the storm hit. Economists warn that the poverty rate on the island of 3.3 million people could increase from 45 percent to more than 60 percent. Meanwhile, a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances approved several austerity measures in late April that Gov. Ricardo Rossello has refused to implement. These include a 10 percent cut to a public pension system facing nearly $50 billion in liabilities. San Juan’s mayor called on Congress to eliminate the control board, which it created two years ago to help resolve Puerto Rico’s economic crisis. “It’s bad, period, if it takes away the rights of the working class,” she said. The recently approved pension cuts are one of the main reasons that Ramon Caban, a 60-year-old retired worker from Puerto Rico’s power company, decided to join the march. “It will be unbearable,” he said. “The future of Puerto Rico is extremely unstable. It’s exasperating because nobody can make plans for the future.”",https://apnews.com/6c43758a0e01451cbfaa37dc2f724b7c/Thousands-in-Puerto-Rico-march-to-protest-austerity-measures,AP,Neutral
Board votes to double tuition at Puerto Rico university,DANICA COTO,4/20/18,"A majority of federal control board members voted Friday to more than double tuition at Puerto Rico’s largest public university despite heavy criticism the increase will make higher education unaffordable. Six of seven members also voted to cut benefits at the University of Puerto Rico and consolidate 11 campuses that serve more than 58,000 students on an island mired in an 11-year recession. “The (university) will no longer be able to afford its status quo operating model,” said Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the board created by U.S. Congress. Government and university officials vowed not to implement certain measures, a day after the board also moved to institute a 10 percent cut to Puerto Rico’s public pension system, which is facing nearly $50 billion in liabilities. Jaresko said those cuts are needed because the system is running out of money. The university fiscal plan approved Friday calls for increasing the undergraduate cost per credit from $57 to $115 by next year, and then to $157 by fiscal year 2023. Darrell Hillman, interim president for the University of Puerto Rico, told radio station WKAQ that he had proposed $75 for next year and up to $140 within five years. “This is like amputating an organ that is vital to the island of Puerto Rico,” he said, noting that families are still struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. “There are a lot of problems with businesses, with jobs...We don’t want to hit the pocketbooks of Puerto Ricans and students.” Board members approved a 10 percent cut in operating costs, called for a need-based scholarship policy and increased various fees including graduation rights from $27 to $80. Javier Cordoba, vice president of the Puerto Rican Association of University Professors, rejected the fiscal plan and said he worries about the consolidation of campuses, among other things. “We believe a lot of students will not be able to pursue their university studies,” he said, referring to the possibility that many will now be forced to travel long distances to a campus. Cordoba said that cutting benefits would make it harder for the University of Puerto Rico to attract qualified professors. A majority of board members also approved toll increases and a 15 percent reduction in personnel costs at Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority. Once again, government officials rejected those measures. “I know it will produce more money, but it will put more burden on the citizens of Puerto Rico,” said Carlos Contreras, the agency’s secretary. The plan states that an average 5 cent annual toll increase would generate an additional $77 million, noting that the agency’s expenses will exceed capital revenues by nearly $500 million in the next six years. It also envisions a $3 billion capital program and aims to reduce traffic and outsource projects, noting that construction cost overruns have been as high as 37 percent per year. The agency is $6 billion in debt and struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, which caused more than $650 million in damage to its infrastructure. The board says that the island’s transportation system has some of the worst fatality rates, pavement conditions and congestion in comparison with U.S. states.",https://apnews.com/bc47ced658f443f987437d9059829019,AP,Neutral
Board reveals austerity measures in Puerto Rico fiscal plans,DANICA COTO,4/19/18,"New austerity measures are looming for Puerto Rico as a federal control board overseeing the U.S. territory’s finances prepares to approve several fiscal plans this week that will serve as the island’s economic blueprint for the next five years. The plans released Wednesday call for a 10 percent average cut to a pension system facing nearly $50 billion in liabilities. They also seek the closure of prisons, consolidation of dozens of state agencies and significant reductions in government subsidies to the island’s 78 municipalities and Puerto Rico’s largest public university. The board also said Puerto Rico’s government should cut sick leave and vacation pay by half. “These plans offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do things right and turn these trends around,” board chairman Jose Carrion said, alluding to years of economic decline, excessive borrowing and fiscal mismanagement followed by the devastation caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. The fiscal plan for the island’s central government estimates Puerto Rico will receive more than $50 billion in federal funds to help rebuild from Hurricane Maria, which killed dozens of people and caused an estimated $100 billion in damage when it hit Sept. 20. The plan also anticipates a more than $6 billion surplus over five years as the island struggles to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt load amid an 11-year recession. Puerto Rico’s financial debt coupled with the pension liabilities are nearly twice the size of its economy. The board said the government needs to consolidate its 114 agencies into 22 groups as well as consolidate police stations and replace officers performing civilian duties with “less expensive” civilian personnel. The board is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to approve all seven fiscal plans, including those for Puerto Rico’s power and water and sewer companies. Gov. Ricardo Rossello has said his administration will not approve pension cuts or implement layoffs. Some worry the board’s financial estimates are too optimistic. Economist Jose Caraballo told The Associated Press that help pledged by federal officials might not materialize, leaving the U.S. territory with less money than anticipated. “We know about President Trump’s emotional swings,” he said. “And he might say no next time.” Caraballo also said layoffs are inevitable even though none of the fiscal plans released Wednesday specifically mention them. “To eventually reach those numbers in that plan, I believe dismissals are implicit,” he said. On broader economic matters, the board said Puerto Rico’s government should make a Christmas bonus voluntary for employers and allow employers to dismiss workers without first having to prove just cause. It called for the minimum wage for workers 25 and older to increase by 25 cents an hour and said the government should immediately impose a work requirement for a nutritional assistance program and increase a labor force participation rate that stands at 42 percent, the seventh lowest in the world. These and other labor reform measures are expected to generate some $460 million in savings over the next five years, the board said. It also said the government should improve construction permitting and make it easier to register property and pay taxes. It noted that it takes 191 days to register property in Puerto Rico, compared with 12 days on the U.S. mainland. Meanwhile, it takes 22 procedures and 165 days to get a construction permit in Puerto Rico, compared with five procedures and 89 days in the U.S.",https://apnews.com/8576655a1647424fa3725a030f17a1a6/Board-reveals-austerity-measures-in-Puerto-Rico-fiscal-plans,AP,Neutral
Board approves austerity plans for Puerto Rico amid protests,DANICA COTO,4/19/18,"A majority of federal control board members approved new austerity measures for Puerto Rico on Thursday, saying they would help revitalize the economy and create more jobs amid the U.S. territory’s 11-year recession, while the island’s governor fired off a flurry of tweets promising to defy them. The measures contained within several fiscal plans that will serve as the island’s economic blueprint for the next five years include a 10 percent average cut to a pension system facing nearly $50 billion in liabilities. Other measures include the closure of prisons, consolidation of dozens of state agencies and significant reductions in government subsidies to Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities and its largest public university. The board also said Puerto Rico’s government should cut sick leave and vacation pay by half and eliminate a Christmas bonus. “No one should believe these reforms are being implemented without clear and direct benefit to the people of Puerto Rico,” said Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the board that was set up by Congress. “This will require tough choices and disciplined execution, but the payback is clearly worth it.” One board member, Ana Matosantos, voted against the plans, saying they cut too deeply and do not provide a realistic path to a turnaround for Puerto Rico’s government. “I cannot support too much pain for too little promise,” she said. “There is simply too much risk, too much downside for the people of Puerto Rico and its future under these plans.” Gov. Ricardo Rossello disagreed via Twitter while Jaresko was still talking, saying the board doesn’t have the power to implement any austerity measures. “Our position has always been clear: issues that are not in line with my government’s public policy will not be carried out. Period,” Rossello tweeted. The board could go to court seeking to force Rossello to enforce the measures. Just a month before Hurricane Maria struck last year, the board sued Rossello for refusing to implement proposed furloughs and pension cuts. Board chairman Jose Carrion said he trusts the government will comply and that if it doesn’t, the board will revisit the issue. “That would include legal action,” he said. The board put together seven fiscal plans for Puerto Rico’s government and public agencies. The three main plans were approved Thursday, nearly a year after the U.S. territory filed for what is the largest municipal bankruptcy ever in the U.S. Four more plans remained to be voted on Friday. Hours before the meeting began Thursday, Puerto Rico’s government announced it would try to trim its workforce by offering some workers, including in police and education departments, inducements to leave. Gerardo Portela, executive director of the island’s financial authority, said such workers can keep receiving their salary for a certain period as they transition to the private or nonprofit sector. The board said the government needs to consolidate its 114 agencies into 22 groups as well as consolidate police stations and replace officers performing civilian duties with “less expensive” civilian personnel. During Thursday’s meeting, some government officials said they might consider labor reforms and other measures in the future if needed, an idea that was rejected by board members. “At some point it has to be today that we act. It can’t always be tomorrow,” said board member Andrew Biggs. On broader economic matters, the board wants Puerto Rico’s government to make a Christmas bonus voluntary for private employers and allow businesses to dismiss workers without first having to prove just cause. It also is calling for the minimum wage for workers 25 and older to increase by 25 cents an hour under certain conditions, and says the government should increase a labor force participation rate that stands at 42 percent, the seventh lowest in the world.

Puerto Rico restores power to over 70 percent of customers after blackout,Reuters Staff,4/19/18,"Puerto Rico’s power company said it had restored power to over 1. 1 million homes and businesses by Thursday morning after a transmission line failure cut service to almost all of the island’s 3. 4 million residents the day before. Slideshow ( 2 images )The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, was working to restore power to the less than 30 percent of customers in the U.S. territory still without power after Wednesday morning’s blackout. The power line failure in southern Puerto Rico was the latest in a string of operational and political headaches for the bankrupt, stormravaged power utility. The utility has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. Maria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday’s blackout. PREPA said on Twitter that several power plants were back in service, including units at Central Aguirre, EcoElectrica, Central Costa Sur, Yabucoa and Palo Seco. The blackout was caused by the failure of a 230kilovolt transmission line between the oilfired Aguirre generating complex in Salinas and AES Corp's AES. N coalfired power plant in Guayama, PREPA said in a statement on Wednesday. PREPA estimated on Wednesday that it would take 24 to 36 hours to restore service to all customers that had power before Wednesday’s blackout. Before the outage, PREPA said 1. 43 million homes and businesses had electric service. That is 97. 2 percent of the utility's 1. 47 million total customers. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt. rs/2jYDF9s)Many of the remaining 40,000 customers have been without power since Hurricane Maria. PREPA has suffered several blackouts since the storm, including an outage last week affecting about 870,000 customers, and has been in bankruptcy since July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-utilities-blackout-idUSKBN1HQ1YU,Reuters,Neutral
Power restored to those hit by Puerto Rico blackout,DANICA COTO,4/19/18,"Puerto Rico’s power company said Thursday that it has restored electricity to all customers affected by an island-wide blackout that was caused by an excavator hitting a transmission line, but tens of thousands of families still remain without normal service seven months after hurricanes Maria and Irma. Officials said that power had been restored to more than 1.4 million of its clients following Wednesday’s blackout. The outage marked the first time Puerto Rico was hit by an island-wide blackout since Hurricane Maria struck on Sept. 20 and wiped out as much as 75 percent of the power distribution lines. The blackout snarled traffic, forced businesses and schools to close and sparked long lines at gas stations. Prior to the blackout on the U.S. territory of 3.3 million people, more than 44,000 customers were still without normal electric service lost with Hurricane Maria. Some have been without power even longer, hit when Hurricane Irma brushed past Puerto Rico’s northeast coast as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 7, leaving 1 million customers without power, including university student Jonathan Rodriguez and his family. “I knew we’d be without power for some time, but not this long,” the 22-year-old told The Associated Press by phone. Rodriguez lives in the central mountain town of Corozal with two relatives, both of whom need electricity to survive. His grandmother depends on insulin and his aunt on equipment to prevent sleep apnea. Nearly every day after work, Rodriguez drives 20 minutes to the nearest gas station to buy fuel that keeps a donated generator running all day and night. The main road near their house is already lit up, as are homes surrounding theirs, but they still don’t have power. “They haven’t given us any information,” he said of power restoration crews. “All we’re missing is one post and a transformer.” The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing federal power restoration efforts, said it expects the entire island to be energized by late May, just weeks before the Atlantic hurricane season starts on June 1. But many believe it will take longer, and a group of federal legislators has asked the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to extend the Corps’ assignment past May 18 to ensure all Puerto Ricans are once again connected to the island’s fragile power grid. Meanwhile, some legislators also have called on the U.S. Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold an oversight hearing on federal efforts to restore power on the island. “Puerto Ricans are still dealing with constant setbacks and unreliable power,” said Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida. “This is just simply unacceptable.” The blackout comes as Puerto Rico legislators debate whether to private the island’s Electric Power Authority, which is $14 billion in debt and relies on infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average.",https://apnews.com/fef8d92e7822435ca7b61e04b7621f8f/Power-restored-to-those-hit-by-Puerto-Rico-blackout,AP,Neutral
Excavator blamed for island-wide blackout in Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,4/18/18,"An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday after an excavator accidentally downed a transmission line, officials said, as the U.S. territory struggles to repair an increasingly unstable power grid nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria. Officials said it could take 24 to 36 hours to fully restore power to more than 1.4 million customers as outrage grew across the island about the state of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority. It was the second major outage in less than a week, with the previous one affecting some 840,000 customers. “This is too much,” said Luis Oscar Rivera, a computer technician who just got normal power back at his house less than two months ago. “It’s like the first day of Maria all over again.” Authorities said the same contractor was involved in the two latest big power failures and had been fired. The outage last Thursday was set off when a tree limb fell on a power line as the contractor cleared land in central Puerto Rico and a backup line failed. On Wednesday, an excavator used by the contractor hit a transmission line near the south coast. Several large power outages have hit Puerto Rico in recent months, but Wednesday was the first time since the hurricane struck Sept. 20 that the U.S. territory has experienced a full island-wide blackout. The outage snarled traffic across the island, interrupted classes and work, and forced dozens of businesses to temporarily close, including the largest mall and popular tourist attractions like a 16th century fort in the historic part of Puerto Rico’s capital. Long lines formed stations across the island, while authorities offered assurances that there was enough gasoline available. Backup generators roared to life at the island’s largest public hospital and at its main international airport, where officials reported no cancellations or delays. Meanwhile, the power company said its own customer service center was out of service and asked people to go online or use the phone. Officials said restoring power to hospitals, airports, banking centers and water pumping systems was their priority. Following that would be businesses and then homes. By late in the afternoon, power had returned to several hospitals and at least five of the island’s 78 municipalities. Carmen Yulin Cruz, mayor of the capital of San Juan, said the outage would not interrupt the last of a two-game series between the Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins, which is being played on the island. She said all emergency systems at Hiram Bithorn stadium are functioning and that tower lights and additional security will be placed at the stadium’s parking lot. Justo Gonzalez, the power company’s executive sub-director, told reporters that workers were removing a collapsed tower Wednesday during unrelated power restoration efforts near the south coast and an excavator hit the transmission line. “We are working in areas that are quite crowded with high voltage lines,” he said. Fredyson Martinez, vice president of a union that represents power company workers in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press that he was concerned about the two back-to-back incidents. “That is not normal,” he said. Government officials said a company hired by Cobra Energy known as Dgrimm was involved in both incidents that led to the power outages. Dgrimm had been asked to change its security protocols after the first incident, and it has since been terminated, said William Rios, power generation director. “This is unacceptable for us,” he said, adding that government attorneys were meeting with officials at Cobra Energy, a Mammoth Energy subsidiary. Angel Figueroa, president of the power workers’ union, told reporters that workers were investigating why a backup breaker at a main power station in the island’s southern region did not function when the outage occurred, causing the entire electrical grid to shut down to protect itself. He noted it was the same problem that caused a 2016 power outage that affected the entire island. Geraldo Quinones, a power company spokesman, said in a phone interview that crews are investigating why the breaker failed. Rivera said he worries that such serious power outages are still occurring as the new Atlantic hurricane season, which starts on June 1, approaches. “If there’s a slight storm, we’re going to be worse off than we are right now,” he said. Federal officials who testified before Congress last week said they expect to have a plan by June on how to strengthen and stabilize the island’s power grid, noting that up to 75 percent of distribution lines were damaged by high winds and flooding. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the federal power restoration efforts, said they hope to have the entire island fully energized by May. Some 40,000 power customers still remain without normal electrical service as a result of the hurricane. The new blackout occurred as Puerto Rico legislators debate a bill that would privatize the island’s power company, which is $14 billion in debt and relies on infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-hurricanes-f16313a8ccba490c94fd883e43db6bae,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to get $18.5 billion to rebuild shattered housing market,Luis J. Valentin Ortiz,4/10/18,"Puerto Rico will receive $18. 5 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help rebuild its battered housing stock and infrastructure after September’s Hurricane Maria, the island’s governor and HUD officials said on Tuesday. Slideshow ( 8 images )The funding for the U.S. territory was the largest grant in the history of the HUD, said HUD undersecretary Pamela Patenaude. But the award was significantly less than the $46 billion requested by Governor Ricardo Rossello in November. HUD is awarding a total of roughly $28 billion to nine states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico that have been recently affected by major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires. The funds are part of a $90 billion disaster aid package signed by Trump in February. The Virgin Islands is set to receive $1. 6 billion in HUD disaster recovery funds, a department media advisory said on Tuesday. Rossello said at a news conference that he expected to adjust Puerto Rico’s fiscal turnaround plan to reflect the full grant. The most recent version of the plan pegged at $13 billion the amount of funds from HUD that the commonwealth expected to receive. Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, and the plan is meant to establish economic projections that will serve as a basis for forthcoming restructuring talks with creditors owed $120 billion in bond and pension debt. Rossello and Patenaude made the announcement in Villa Hugo, a shantytown in Canovanas, which sustained severe damage when Maria hit the island on Sept. 20. Villa Hugo’s 6,000 residents are squatters on government land. Most built their homes informally, and do not own title to their properties. “Informal” construction ,which can also refer to property owners who illegally subdivide their land ,is thought to comprise between onefourth and onehalf of Puerto Rico’s 1. 2 million homes. The prevalence of informal housing, which often does not comply with building codes, was thought to compound damage to Puerto Rico’s housing stock when the storm hit. The HUD funds can be used for housing, economic development and infrastructure, and could be used to help repair the island’s crippled power grid. While local authorities determine where funds will be used, HUD provides technical assistance and guidelines, Patenaude said. Maria was a vicious blow to an already struggling island that has been in recession for more than a decade, with a poverty rate near 50 percent. Puerto Rico now projects to receive roughly $50 billion during the next six years in federal disaster relief assistance, mostly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the government’s latest fiscal turnaround plan.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-housing-idUSKBN1HH3IR,Reuters,Neutral
FEMA: Puerto Rico running out of time as storm season nears,DANICA COTO,4/6/18,"The administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it will take up to an estimated $50 billion to help rebuild Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria and warned that the U.S. territory is not ready for another disaster. Brock Long said his agency aims to make the island’s roads, homes, bridges and electrical grid as strong as possible but noted that the next hurricane season starts June 1. “We’re running out of time,” he said during a visit to Puerto Rico, adding that much of the island’s infrastructure collapsed. “We have a long way to go.” Long said his agency also is coordinating a June 14 planning and training exercise with Puerto Rico’s government in which life-saving supplies will be delivered to the island’s 78 municipalities to ensure better response times for any upcoming storms. Cities and towns will be allowed to store those supplies for future disasters. FEMA and local government officials already have stockpiled more than 15.6 million liters of water and more than 2.8 million meals in five warehouses across the island in the event of another disaster. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said late Friday that FEMA also approved more than $53 million in community disaster loans for 12 of the island’s 78 municipalities. Long stressed that Puerto Rico’s public and private sectors have to build a strong emergency response network and establish unified plans. “FEMA cannot be directly responsible for all of the response and recovery,” he said. He also said the private sector should ensure that communication systems become more resistant. Maria left nearly all of Puerto Rico without phone service after the Category 4 storm hit on Sept. 20. Long defended his agency from ongoing criticism that it did not respond quickly enough to the hurricane or dedicate the same amount of resources compared with other natural disasters in the U.S. mainland. ″(That’s) completely false,” he said, adding that in the first six months since Maria hit, FEMA invested $10 billion in Puerto Rico, in contrast to the $6 billion invested in the six months after Hurricane Katrina. He said his agency is working to reduce bureaucracy but needs to ensure that federal funds will be spent appropriately. “Recovery never moves as fast as people want it to be,” he said. “And in this case, moving faster can be detrimental from the standpoint of putting this money to work in a manner that truly makes Puerto Rico stronger and more resilient.” Mike Byrne, FEMA’s federal coordinating officer in Puerto Rico, said he is working with the U.S. territory’s government to determine how federal funds will be used to identify priorities and rebuild damaged infrastructure. Byrne said some of the money will go toward strengthening the island’s power grid since the storm destroyed two-thirds of its distribution system.  More than 50,000 power customers remain in the dark, but he said 96 percent of all customers now have electricity. “We’ve done the Band-Aid,” he said. “We’ve patched the system back together.” Long said the recovery process has been slow in part because supplies ranging from construction equipment to power poles have been scarce in light of the natural disasters that hit the U.S. mainland, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands last year. Officials said FEMA will have a presence in Puerto Rico for several years to help it rebuild.",https://apnews.com/7c238de9e23a4c41b2f557e671e5a12d/FEMA:-Puerto-Ricorunning-out-of-time-as-storm-season-nears,AP,Neutral
"UPDATE 1-Latest Puerto Rico fiscal plan does not budge on pensions, layoffs",Nick Brown,4/6/18,"Puerto Rico’s latest turnaround plan boosts the insolvent U.S. territory’s projected ability to pay debt, but the plan’s absence of pension cuts and layoffs means some alterations may be in store, courtesy of the island’s oversight board. The plan, published on Thursday night, forecasts a cumulative surplus of $6. 3 billion through fiscal year 2023, and $7. 36 billion after accounting for nonrecurring items. That projection started as a deficit in January, and has climbed incrementally through a handful of draft plans. Puerto Rico, which is in bankruptcy with $120 billion in debt while it struggles to recover from the devastation caused last September by Hurricane Maria, is required to submit a turnaround plan as a basis for planned restructuring talks with bondholders. Puerto Rico’s benchmark GO bond traded at 43 cents on the dollar on Friday, up from a close of 41. 06 cents on Thursday , according to Thomson . It had been trading around 60 cents before Maria hit. The oversight board, created by the U.S. Congress to manage Puerto Rico’s finances, can impose its own plan if it rejects the one submitted by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello. The two sides remain apart on key issues after months of negotiations. The board has proposed, to Rossello’s chagrin, cutting pensions 10 percent, and setting strict deadlines to implement labor reforms like reducing sick days and axing mandatory Christmas bonuses. Rossello also believes he can achieve desired spending cuts without layoffs, but the board remains skeptical. In a letter to the board on Thursday, Rossello said his team has made a goodfaith effort toward compromise and “incorporated most of the baseline components you have recommended. ”But the governor said he will not implement specific policies, like pension cuts, that should fall to a democratically elected government, and which would require legislation. The board has some leverage. It can make cuts to Puerto Rico’s budget, and can take Rossello to court if his administration refuses to implement measures it demands. PENSIONS A DEALBREAKER?The two sides can keep negotiating until April 20, the board’s selfimposed deadline for approving the fiscal plan. On Thursday, two board sources told  it was unlikely the deadline would be extended. The board expects to approve a plan that day even if it means imposing measures unilaterally. Absent a compromise, the board would add discrete measures to the governor’s existing framework rather than draw up its own plan, the sources said. A government source told  on Thursday that Rossello does not want to perpetuate litigation, and was hoping for consensus. The divide on pension cuts may not be a dealbreaker, the source said, because adjustments to Puerto Rico’s untenable $50 billion pension shortfall could be done in the island’s bankruptcy, as part of a debt restructuring plan. But the two board sources expressed doubt that a majority of the sevenmember panel would support a plan without pension cuts, though a third board source said it was possible. Since the plan’s projections will serve as the basis for eventual debt restructuring talks, pension savings should be reflected in the plan, the initial two board sources said. Labor reform may provide more room for compromise. One option, according to the board sources, would be to extend the deadline for imposing some of those reforms until after the next gubernatorial election in November 2020.",https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-fiscalplan-idUSL2N1RJ0VD,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico teachers union seeks to stop charter schools,DANICA COTO,4/3/18,"A Puerto Rico teachers union filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the island’s education department seeking to stop the U.S. territory from creating charter schools and offering private school vouchers as part of an overhaul of the education system. The lawsuit filed by the Association of Puerto Rican Teachers, which represents some 30,000 teachers, argues that it is unconstitutional to use public funds or property for private schools. “To say charters are public schools when they are going to be administered, directed and controlled by private hands is clearly an illegal and unconstitutional contradiction,” union president Aida Diaz said. Department of Education spokeswoman Yolanda Rosaly said the agency had no immediate comment. Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario said in a statement that the government will fight the lawsuit and is moving ahead with the education overhaul targeting Puerto Rico’s 1,110 public schools that serve 319,000 students. “We were sure we would have opposition from certain sectors who resist these changes we so badly need,” he said. The lawsuit was filed less than a week after Gov. Ricardo Rossello signed a bill to implement a charter schools pilot program in 10 percent of public schools and offer private school vouchers to 3 percent of students starting in 2019-2020. The overhaul will attempt to restructure an education department that has long struggled with bureaucracy and seen its resources dwindle amid an 11-year-old recession. The legislation signed Thursday aims to decentralize the agency, ensure that 70 percent of its budget reaches schools and give teachers their first raise in a decade starting next year. The U.S. territory’s government also plans to close some 300 schools starting next year. Puerto Rico has seen its enrollment drop by 78,000 students in the past four years amid the economic crisis, and officials expect to lose 54,000 more students in the next four years. More than 25,000 students have left since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September.",https://apnews.com/ad628a6bbb1a4e9ebbe1de31a7229cdc/Puerto-Rico-teachers-union-seeks-to-stop-charter-schools,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor slams congressman over 'dictatorial' letter,Nick Brown,4/2/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Monday fiercely defended his administration’s right to help steer the insolvent, stormravaged island out of bankruptcy after a U.S. congressman said the process should be led by the island’s creditors and federally appointed oversight board. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello speaks during a Facebook live broadcast in the library of the governor's mansion, in San Juan, Puerto Rico January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez In a scorching, 6,000word letter delivered on Monday to U.S. Representative Rob Bishop, and seen by , Governor Ricardo Rossello accused the Republican lawmaker of turning “back the clock many decades to a time when the federal government simply imposed its will” on the U.S. territory. Bishop, who chairs the House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, was at the forefront of a 2016 federal law known as PROMESA, which moved Puerto Rico’s finances under the management of a federally appointed board. In a letter last week, Bishop censured the board for lack of progress on a massive planned debt restructuring in Puerto Rico, directing the board to seek more input from the island’s financial creditors on a plan to stabilize the island. Rossello said on Monday that flew in the face of PROMESA, which calls for the board and the governor to work together. He said the sides had made consensual progress on elements of Puerto Rico’s restructuring. “I cannot and will not permit you to elevate concerns of bondholders on the mainland above concern for the wellbeing of my constituents,” Rossello said in the 13page rebuke. “Your letter is truly disturbing in its reckless disregard for collaboration and cooperation in favor of an antidemocratic process akin to a dictatorial regime. ”Puerto Rico is navigating both the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with $120 billion in bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years with September’s Hurricane Maria. The storm killed dozens, devastated the island’s infrastructure, and has left thousands without power more than six months later. Rossello’s letter, scattered with legal arguments supporting a theory that the board’s powers are limited, foreshadows the potential for litigation if his government and the oversight board cannot come to terms on a path forward for the island. The two sides have been collaborating on an economic forecast, called a fiscal turnaround plan, whose projections will determine, crucially, how much money the island has left over to repay its bondholders. But they are apart on key issues, namely demands by the board to impose pension cuts and labor reforms. The governor has said those demands constitute specific policy decisions that exceed the board’s power. The board has the authority to certify a plan unilaterally if it cannot reach terms with the governor, and Bishop’s letter was seen as a nod to that increasingly likely scenario. In it, Bishop essentially instructed the board to use its powers to enforce austerity measures and start collaborating with creditors rather than with just the government. A unilateral plan would likely perpetuate already costly litigation over Puerto Rico’s financial future, because Rossello could resist implementing the board’s plan, and the board could then sue to enforce it, a scenario that has some precedent. Rossello insisted his government was owed a seat at the table. “Congress did not create a control board . . . with plenary policymaking power,” the governor said. “Congress expressly rejected such a model. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-letter-idUSKCN1H91Y1,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico governor to revise fiscal plan, but won't budge on austerity",Nick Brown,4/1/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor said on Sunday he would submit a revised fiscal turnaround plan on Thursday to the island’s federally appointed oversight board, but the plan would not include labor reforms and pension cuts the board demanded. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello speaks during a Facebook live broadcast in the library of the governor's mansion, in San Juan, Puerto Rico January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin BaezGovernor Ricardo Rossello also said the government of the bankrupt and hurricaneravaged island would not allow the oversight board to usurp its legislative powers. “The Government will not allow the takeover of these powers, and therefore cannot be compelled to implement many of the suggested revisions,” Rossello told the board in an April 2 letter made public with a press release. The revised plan will exclude layoffs of public employees, the release said. The comments appear to increase the likelihood of litigation between the local government and the board, which was appointed by the U.S. Congress in 2016 and is charged with approving a blue print for Puerto Rico’s turnaround. Puerto Rico is navigating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years caused by Hurricane Maria in September. The letter bolsters a hardline position Rossello has taken in the past, including last week when he responded to a letter from the board. The disagreement comes as the governor seems to have few allies on the mainland. U.S. lawmakers and financial creditors have accused Puerto Rico of overstating its financial straits, while previous austerity moves have angered unions. The oversight board has called for measures including cuts to public employee pensions averaging 10 percent. The fiscal reform measures ultimately adopted will determine how much money the U.S. commonwealth has left over to pay holders of $71. 5 billion in bonds in a massive debt restructuring. Rossello complained in the letter that the board is trying to enforce additional cuts on government employee and retirement benefits at the “worst possible moment,” as Puerto Rico attempts to recover from reduced government services and economic loss.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-fiscalplan-idUSKCN1H9036,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico reaches deal to access U.S. disaster loans,Nick Brown,3/22/18,"The U.S. Treasury Department and stormravaged Puerto Rico say they have reached a deal to let the bankrupt U.S. territory access billions of dollars in longdisputed federal loans to help it recover from last year’s Hurricane Maria. Slideshow ( 2 images )In a joint news conference on Thursday in San Juan, broadcast on the internet, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the island can access the socalled community disaster loans (CDLs) as needed until March 2020, once its cash balance dwindles below $1. 1 billion. The agreement still needs approval by the federallyappointed board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances, as well as the judge presiding over its $120 billion bankruptcy. Spokesmen for the board had no immediate comment on Thursday. The dispute over the loan had ratcheted up tensions between Puerto Rico and Washington, as the island battles the aftermath of its biggest natural disaster in 90 years, while navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history. It also raised questions about the reliability of Puerto Rico’s financial recordkeeping. The U.S. Congress in October appropriated $4. 9 billion in loans for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but while the Virgin Islands were allowed access to the funds ,and have drawn down around $200 million so far ,Puerto Rico was not. The island’s leadership warned that devastation from September’s Hurricane Maria could cause it to run out of cash, but the U.S. Treasury, along with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, found that Puerto Rico had $1. 7 billion in its coffers. Last month, the Treasury said it would consider allowing access to around $2 billion, but only under conditions that Rossello called “extremely difficult” in a Feb. 26 letter to U.S. lawmakers. He complained, in the same letter, of Treasury’s “arbitrary conduct” in denying access. Under Thursday’s accord, Puerto Rico can begin accessing money on an asneeded basis, once its cash reserves dip below $1. 1 billion. It remains unclear how much Puerto Rico may initially draw down, Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, told  on Thursday. Rossello thanked Mnuchin at the news conference, saying, “When there are issues to be resolved, the best way to do it is principal to principal, face to face. ”Mnuchin, who stopped on the island on his way back from the G20 meetings in Argentina, said it “was very important” to meet with Rossello to “make sure we resolve whatever issues we had. ”Puerto Rico was already in bankruptcy, battling nearinsolvent health and pension systems and a decadelong recession, when Maria hit on Sept. 20. The storm killed dozens and decimated the island’s already substandard housing stock and electric grid. Thousands remain without power six months later.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-puertorico-idUSKBN1GY2ND,Reuters,Neutral
Needs go unmet 6 months after Maria hit Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,3/20/18,"Generators are still humming. Candles are still flickering. Homes are still being repaired. Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria exactly six months ago, and the U.S. territory is still struggling to recover from the strongest storm to hit the island in nearly a century. “There are a lot of people with needs,” said Levid Ortiz, operating director of PR4PR, a local nonprofit that helps impoverished communities across the island. “It shouldn’t be like this. We should already be back on our feet.” Some 250 Puerto Ricans formed a line around him on a recent weekday, standing for more than two hours to receive bottles of water and a box of food at a public basketball court in the mountain town of Corozal. Many of those waiting were still without power, including 23-year-old Keishla Quiles, a single mother with a 4-year-old son who still buys ice every day to fill a cooler to keep milk and other goods cold amid rising temperatures. “Since we’re a family of few resources, we have not been able to afford a generator,” she said. “It’s been hard living like this.” Crews already have restored water to 99 percent of clients and power to 93 percent of customers, but more than 100,000 of them still remain in the dark and there are frequent power outages. Justo Gonzalez, former interim director for Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, said he expects the entire island to have power by May, eight months after the Category 4 storm destroyed two-thirds of the island’s power distribution system — and just as the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season is about to start. Gonzalez was replaced on Tuesday by Walter Higgins, former president of a power company that provided electricity in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Officials in Puerto Rico have pledged to inspect dozens of wooden and cement poles still leaning haphazardly across the island after a wooden telephone pole fell on a car. It killed an elderly couple on Sunday as they returned from a town fair in the mountains of western Puerto Rico. The deaths of Luis Beltran, 62, and Rosa Bosque, 60, have angered Puerto Ricans and raised concerns about the safety of people as they recover from the hurricane. “It worries me because ... it can happen anywhere,” Mayor Edwin Soto told The Associated Press, adding that crews were going to inspect poles across the mountain town of Las Marias to ensure they are in good condition. Beltran’s youngest sister, Migdalia Beltran, said her brother was living in New Jersey when Hurricane Maria hit, but that he moved back three months ago to be with family. “He was No. 1,” she said as her voice cracked and she began to cry. “He was the one who gave me support to keep going.” The storm caused an estimated $100 billion in damage, killed dozens of people and damaged or destroyed nearly 400,000 homes, according to Puerto Rico’s government. In the six months since the hurricane, more than 135,000 people have fled to the U.S. mainland, according to a recent estimate by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York. More than 40 percent of them settled in Florida, followed by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania, the study found. Meanwhile, those who stayed behind say they need more help. The AP recently found that of the $23 billion pledged for Puerto Rico, only $1.27 billion for a nutritional assistance program has been disbursed, along with more than $430 million to repair public infrastructure. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency also has spent more than $6 billion from its standing emergency fund. Tom Bossert, U.S. President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser, said Tuesday that Puerto Rico would soon receive another $10 billion for various restoration efforts. “We’re going to redouble our efforts to work as fast as we can on their behalf,” he said of Puerto Ricans during a three-day visit to the island. However, he said the administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello needs to come up with a plan on how to rebuild a stronger power grid and create financial accounting methods to ensure federal funds are being appropriately spent. “It makes no sense for the people of the United States to continue to pay money for repetitive loss in these disasters.” He also said federal hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico have exceeded his expectations. “That doesn’t mean I’m satisfied. It doesn’t mean the president is satisfied,” Bossert said. “We still have some challenges.” Meanwhile, the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources issued a letter on Friday demanding that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers explain why it is reducing the number of crews helping restore power when there are still people who remain in the dark. “While we recognize that much progress has been made in restoring power to the majority of customers, the job is not done,” the letter stated. Col. Jason Kirk, who is overseeing power restoration efforts for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said Tuesday that Puerto Rico’s power company will be primarily responsible for restoring electricity to remaining customers.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-hurricanes-de367742d0c440de85e4b6cb107973d4,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico power utility hacked but customer data not at risk,Nick Brown,3/19/18,"Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power utility, PREPA, said on Monday it had been hacked over the weekend, but customer information was not compromised. A man walks past the headquarters of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) in San Juan, Puerto Rico January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez The computer infrastructure of PREPA, as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is known, suffered a cyber attack on Sunday night, Executive Director Justo Gonzalez Torres said in a statement. “In these moments we are protecting the systems and working to resolve the situation,” Gonzalez said in Spanish, adding that investigations into the source of the hack were ongoing. PREPA’s customer service system was not affected and customer information was not at risk, the utility said, though the attack led to longer wait times at its service center. The news comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump’s blaming the Russian government last week for a campaign of cyber attacks targeting the U.S. power grid. As of Monday evening, there was no indication that Russia was to blame for PREPA’s hack. When asked about potential sources of the attack, a spokesman for PREPA said the matter was “being investigated and referred to the relevant authorities,” declining to say who those authorities were. A spokesman for Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello had no immediate comment. It is the latest in a cavalcade of headaches for PREPA, which last year filed a form of U.S. bankruptcy to shed some $9 billion in debt. Four months later, in September, its grid was virtually destroyed when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, knocking out power to all 3. 4 million residents of the U.S. commonwealth. Rossello has announced plans to privatize PREPA, which is burdened by outdated infrastructure and years of bloated administrative spending. Hurricane Maria was the worst storm to strike Puerto Rico in 90 years, killing dozens and causing tens of billions of dollars in damage. It came as the territory was already facing an historic economic crisis, having filed the largest U.S. government bankruptcy in history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-cyberattack-idUKKBN1GV30A,Reuters,Neutral
"6 months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico pleads for help",DANICA COTO,3/16/18,"Hurricane Maria shredded the electric poles in this plantain farming town high in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, leaving tens of thousands of people without power or running water. Desperate, residents of the town’s Barrio Mana neighborhood asked federal officials for a generator to pump water from the well that supplies the neighborhood’s 130 families. That was nearly six months ago. Today, like everyone in Barrio Mana, World War II veteran Antonio Morales, 93, sleeps in a single-story concrete home with no running water, its floor covered with dozens of gallon jugs and plastic buckets of water that his nurse uses to bathe him. “Barrio Mana is not even on the government’s radar,” said Morales’ 61-year-old daughter-in-law, Maria Perez, her eyes filled with tears. “Practically no one has shown up here.” Super-charged with energy from unusually warm seas, Hurricane Maria caused roughly $100 billion in damage to Puerto Rico when it roared across the island Sept. 20, according to the government of the U.S. territory. In November, Puerto Rico asked Congress for $94 billion to fund needs ranging from power restoration to home repairs. U.S. lawmakers have appropriated $23 billion in direct aid, a response that some Puerto Rican officials called woefully inadequate. Separately, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent some $6 billion for Puerto Rico from its standing emergency funds since the hurricane. As the six-month anniversary of the Category 4 storm approaches, only a fraction of the $23 billion in congressionally approved funds has actually been spent in Puerto Rico. In February, a $4.7 billion loan approved last year for Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was reduced by the U.S. Treasury Department to $2 billion for Puerto Rico, none of which has been disbursed. And programs funded with FEMA money, like generators for rural wells, have yet to reach thousands of Puerto Ricans like those in Barrio Mana, American citizens living in Third World conditions six months after a natural disaster. Puerto Rican officials say the Trump administration is neglecting the territory because it doesn’t have a vote in Congress or presidential elections. The Trump administration has blamed Puerto Rico for creating delays in the disbursement process, but has not been more specific. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still waiting for permanent shelter, water or power as the next Atlantic hurricane season approaches. “If we were a state, the response certainly would have been a lot quicker,” said Omar Marrero, director of Puerto Rico’s Central Recovery and Reconstruction Office. He said that of the $23 billion, Puerto Rico has so far received only $1.27 billion for its federal assistance nutrition program and $430 million to help repair public infrastructure. Last week, 58 U.S. legislators sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin demanding the agency expedite the loan process and offer the full amount. “At a time when people on the island are hurting, it is unconscionable to not provide maximum relief to American citizens at the hour of their greatest need,” they wrote. “Unfortunately, the Treasury Department seems more concerned with repayment of the loan than in providing emergency liquidity relief to an island battered by two hurricanes and 11 years of recession.” Puerto Rico remains mired in a longstanding economic crisis, struggling to restructure a portion of $73 billion in public debt accumulated through years of mismanagement, corruption and the elimination of decades-old federal tax breaks. The response to Maria has unleashed fresh allegations of corruption and mismanagement of federal aid. Mnuchin testified to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee that Puerto Rico’s government was delaying the process by making unreasonable demands, which he declined to specify. “I can assure you we have a team at Treasury that stands ready to lend them money right away,” he said. “We are not holding this up.” Maria destroyed some 75,000 homes and damaged 300,000 more, causing an estimated $31 billion in damage to housing alone, said the island’s housing secretary, Fernando Gil. FEMA has granted more than $1 billion in rent payments, home repairs and other expenses, spokesman Daniel Llargues said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has installed more than 59,000 tarps for the roughly 60,000 homes approved for the project, according to public affairs director Jacqueline Tate. But billions of dollars remain pending, including $1.5 billion in congressionally appropriated money that was promised last month in community development block grants for Puerto Rico’s Department of Housing. “If we had power in Congress ... I ask myself if any federal agency would treat us as second-class citizens,” Gil said. “They are not doing this to Texas. They are not doing this to Florida.” In Barrio Mana, neighbors cleared a small piece of land five months ago after meeting with federal officials who pledged to provide a generator to pump water from the neighborhood’s well. “After that, we never saw them again,” said Enemias Rivera, the well’s administrator. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it is awaiting permission from FEMA to install the generator, but FEMA said it has not received a request from the administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello. Meanwhile, Corozal town officials did not return calls for comment. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress, and a spokeswoman for Rossello did not return requests for comment. FEMA said in a statement that it continues to work with Puerto Rico’s government and other agencies and groups, and noted that the response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico was the largest disaster air delivery mission in U.S. history. “After two catastrophic hurricanes struck the island six months ago, we realize that there will still be unmet needs, as federal assistance isn’t meant to make people whole, but help survivors start their recovery,” the agency said. Six months after Hurricane Maria, 97 percent of water customers do have service and 91 percent of power customers have electricity. But for those rural areas that remain in the dark, power company officials are considering installing FEMA-funded battery-powered solar panels to provide more immediate relief, Electric Power Authority interim director Justo Gonzalez said. At the same time the company is struggling with nearly weekly outages. The most recent one, on Monday, affected some 50,000 customers. Two weeks ago, some 970,000 people were left in the dark. The Power Authority also is facing allegations of corruption and mismanagement. On Monday, the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources demanded documents related to any investigations into the allegations, including that crews accepted bribes to restore power first to strip clubs and that some restored power to their own homes ahead of the island’s largest public hospital and main international airport. The company has said it has not received any complaints or information regarding those allegations, but said it would investigate if anyone came forward with information. Perez and her neighbors say they have given up hope they will ever get a generator for their well. “They’ve abandoned all of us,” said Jose Antonio Rosado, whose wife needs dialysis three times a week and depends on an electricity inverter that a nonprofit organization donated to the couple as they continue to wait for power and water connections. “The help never, never, never materialized.”",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-hurricanes-aacab7041b4748408bd3911ad476d140,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico reforms could boost GNP by 1.5 percent: Jaresko,Daniel Bases,3/14/18,"Structural reforms could boost Puerto Rico’s economy by as much as 1. 5 percent, but federal tax law changes on top of deadly hurricanes pose additional challenges, the executive director of the island’s financial oversight board said. FILE PHOTO: Natalie Jaresko, Executive Director of the Federal Fiscal Control Board of Puerto Rico attends a meeting of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico at the College of Engineers and Land Surveyors in San Juan, Puerto Rico October 31, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez Natalie Jaresko, who leads the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board’s executive team, said she expects the revised fiscal reform plans submitted by the U.S. commonwealth’s government to be certified on March 26. The three critical structural reform areas she highlighted were the electrical grid, overseen by the beleaguered Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) that is slated to be partially privatized; labor market reforms; and making it easier to do business. “What is really critical is that they do these structural reforms that can deliver billions of dollars (to the budget) in the out years, if done now and in a way that is meaningful, not incremental or slow,” she said in a telephone interview from San Juan late on Wednesday. “Getting those things done could add 1 to 1. 5 percent of GNP (gross national product) growth and that could create the real stable turnaround in the economy that is necessary to do a fixed piece of debt,” she said. Under a 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, Congress appointed six members to a board tasked with managing the territory’s finances, with President Barack Obama adding a seventh. PROMESA gave the board authority to push Puerto Rico into a courtsupervised debt restructuring akin to U.S. bankruptcy. The island is navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt when it declared bankruptcy in May 2017 after more than a decade of recession. REBUILDSeptember’s Hurricane Maria was Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in 90 years, killing dozens, decimating local infrastructure and knocking out power to the island’s 3. 4 million U.S. citizens. More than five months later more than 8 percent, or 120,991 customers remain without power, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Jaresko said it was safe to say approximately $35 billion to $45 billion has been appropriated for relief and rebuilding, including earmarks from the U.S. Congress and money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is not fixed. That overall range does not include $4. 8 billion in Medicaid money, nor roughly $4. 8 billion in unreleased Community Development Loans. She noted another estimate of $21 billion in private insurance that will provide an economic stimulus. One of the board’s main focus points is to restructure the electrical grid, lower the cost of electricity and make the power supply more reliable, Jaresko said. If electric rates are low and stable, they would create a revenue stream that would allow the government to restructure the more than $9 billion of defaulted PREPA debt, she said. PREPA had a deal with creditors but it was never certified by the board. “Frankly speaking, one of the reasons that deal was not approved by the board. . . is if we don’t bring down the cost of electricity, we will continue to have people moving off the grid,” and the ability to repay debt becomes even more of a challenge, she said. For decades, favorable U.S. tax treatment allowed the economy to be built with a competitive advantage. While those advantages eroded over time and led to the recession, December’s U.S. tax law changes stripped away the last benefits. “To remove it without the ability to plan and build other competitive advantages is extraordinarily difficult. To have to do that without notice and then have to do that while rebuilding the economy. . . I think it is very difficult policy timing. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1GR0AD,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. House panel probes corruption allegations at Puerto Rico utility,Daniel Bases,3/12/18,"The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee on Monday issued a letter seeking answers to allegations of corruption at Puerto Rico’s beleaguered electric utility, including reports that some officials accepted bribes to restore power to exotic dance clubs ahead of schedule. The logo of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) is seen in Dorado, Puerto Rico January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has failed to restore power fully to the U.S. commonwealth’s 3. 4 million residents since Hurricane Maria in late September knocked out power to the entire island, caused a complete collapse of the utility’s already decrepit electric infrastructure and killed dozens of people. As of early March, 12. 5 percent of PREPA’s customers still did not have electricity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The letter said that as part of the committee’s oversight of Puerto Rico’s recover, it was reviewing “multiple allegations of corruption and mismanagement” of PREPA’s power restoration efforts. “Much of the reported corruption concerns PREPA officials accepting or demanding bribes to restore power to residences and businesses,” said the letter, which was addressed to PREPA’s interim executive director, Justo Gonzalez. PREPA officials allegedly were paid $5,000 and provided free entry tickets worth $1,000 apiece to restore power to exotic dance clubs ahead of schedule. In other instances, PREPA officials are accused of restoring power to their own homes before restoring power to “critical locations such as San Juan’s Rio Piedras Medical Center and the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport. ”The letter accuses PREPA of mismanaging a warehouse where materials were stored that should have been available to help restore power on the island. The mismanagement exacerbated an equipment shortage and contributed to idled work crews and delayed repairs. The warehouse in question was not included in computerized inventory lists with PREPA failing to answer questions from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. “PREPA’s explanations for Warehouse 5 and its inventory have been contradictory and, frankly, inadequate,” the letter said, referring to the utility’s original claim that the materials were from past infrastructure projects, included outdated surplus supplies and recycled parts. After the Army Corps of Engineers distributed the materials, PREPA changed its story, the letter alleges, to one indicating that the materials were intended for present, not past, projects. The letter asks PREPA to preserve all records, documents, data and communications regarding all open PREPA investigations into “allegations of corruption, favoritism, or abuse of authority by PREPA employees, officials, or contractors. ”It also seeks information surrounding the warehouse in question. All materials are to be submitted to the committee by 5 p. m on March 26. The letter was signed by the committee chairman, Representative Rob Bishop, Bruce Westerman, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and Doug LaMalfa, chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-prepa-probe-idUSKCN1GP03P,Reuters,Neutral
"Crew with seeds, corals restore environment in Puerto Rico",DANICA COTO,3/9/18,"As crews re-string electric lines and clear debris from Hurricane Maria, a small group of Puerto Rican and international conservationists is working on rebuilding natural wonders destroyed by the strongest storm to hit the island in nearly a century. Environmental groups and volunteers are gathering native seeds to replant forests across the U.S. territory and grafting broken coral back onto shattered reefs to help repair damage in the largest-ever effort of its kind for Puerto Rico. The Category 4 storm damaged 1.2 billion trees and snapped hundreds of thousands of corals off reefs around the island when it hit on Sept. 20. Despite the widespread destruction, a lack of funding and pressing human needs kept pushing back long-term plans to replant trees and rebuild corals. Now that Puerto Rico is slowly regaining its footing after the storm and initial funding has been secured, conservationists are fanning out across the island and into its waters to repair and restore what’s left of the island’s flora. “The damage is huge,” said Nilda Jimenez, marine ecology director for the island’s Department of Natural Resources. Helping nature recover has environmental and economic importance: Puerto Rico’s natural beauty is one of its biggest tourist draws. Experts also note that reefs protect coasts from heavy swells and serve as habitat for many species consumed on the island, including red snappers, lobsters and octopi. Last week, a group of divers assembled on a dock in the northeast coastal town of Fajardo, a popular destination for tourists eager to explore reefs that once boasted bright colors and a multitude of fish. Now, hundreds of broken corals that are still alive lay scattered across the turquoise waters, ranging in size from a grapefruit to a car. Armed with buckets of cement, divers pick up the broken pieces and swim to reefs that have been identified as healthy despite the battering they received from the storm. The divers brush away any algae that have built up and push the pieces down into the freshly laid cement. “If you think about what you’re seeing, it’s broken animals,” said Jim Ritterhoff, executive director of Force Blue, a nonprofit organization made up of retired U.S. Special Operations veterans working on coral reef conservation projects. The group is participating in a nearly $1.5 million project largely funded by the U.S. government with help from the U.S. nonprofit organization Ocean Conservancy to help restore between 100 and 300 corals a day in Puerto Rico for two months. They are focusing on the island’s northeast region, where swaths of mostly elkhorn and staghorn corals received the brunt of large swells generated during the hurricane. If further funding is available, divers will target other areas as well. “The sooner we get out there, the better,” said Sean Griffin, coral reef restoration ecologist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “There are still tens of thousands of corals out there that are upside down or even just on their side that we can get out there and save.” Similar restoration efforts are taking place on land miles away from the divers. At a greenhouse run by the nonprofit group Para La Naturaleza in the capital of San Juan, volunteers and workers tend to thousands of budding plants that will grow into trees as they’re planted across the island. They have planted nearly 1,900 trees since January, with a goal of 750,000 in the next seven years, said Luisa Rosado, the group’s habitat manager. “This is a project where we really won’t see the results,” she said. “The results will be from now to 100 years.” It’s also a labor-intensive project where crews have to return every three months to the site where the trees are planted to monitor their progress during the first year, then every four months in the second year. Rosado said more volunteers are needed, especially because the nonprofit is tied up visiting places around the island trying to find seeds for native and endemic species. Sometimes they get lucky and people call them, saying they uncovered seeds amid hurricane debris. A man from the western mountain town of Lares recently brought in a 4-foot-tall bag filled with branches and leaves but also a tiny black seed known as aceitillo, which is now a rare species. The find drew a big smile from Manuel Sepulveda, greenhouse managing coordinator for Para La Naturaleza. “There are very few seed banks in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean,” he said. “We need millions of seeds.” The efforts also have a deeper meaning for Rosado. “This is a way for us to recuperate together,” she said. “To recover the island.”",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-corals-international-news-8e172a570aed4467893274cbaea2a120,AP,Neutral
Gov't loan for Puerto Rico's PREPA could last into May: lawyer,Luis J. Valentin Ortiz,3/7/18,"The Puerto Rican power utility known as PREPA, operating on a $300 million loan from the island’s bankrupt government, could need more cash by early May to stay afloat, a lawyer for Puerto Rico’s federally appointed oversight board said on Wednesday. PREPA, which itself is bankrupt, was devastated by September’s Hurricane Maria. The storm destroyed much of its electric grid and thousands of Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million American citizens remain without power more than five months later. Puerto Rico’s government lent the utility $300 million in February, and PREPA was expected to need more liquidity by the end of March, attorney Martin Bienenstock said at a San Juan court hearing on Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy case. Betterthanexpected collections, however, provided more breathing room, and PREPA could “have money to get to at least early May,” said Bienenstock, who represents the federal board tasked with helping Puerto Rico regain access to capital markets. Puerto Rico was already navigating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history — with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt — when Maria slammed it on Sept. 20, decimating infrastructure, killing dozens and causing tens of billions of dollars in damages. In January, Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced plans to privatize PREPA, a move that brought an objection from Puerto Rico’s energy regulator. $50 MILLION IN FEESAlso on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain gave Puerto Rico permission to pay up to $50 million in fees and expenses charged by professionals who work on the bankruptcy cases. A report by courtappointed fee examiner Brady Williamson raised flags over firms’ alleged duplicative work, lack of billing details and overattendance at hearings and mediation sessions. Williamson added that he believes everyone “will get better at” the billing process in the future. Fees are a hotbutton issue in big bankruptcies because they are public and because money that goes to a debtor’s lawyers comes out of creditors’ pockets. Top bankruptcy lawyers tend to charge higherthanaverage rates, sometimes more than $1,000 an hour. Judge Swain stressed that it was essential that professionals make “careful use of resources,” adding that she had observed some of the same issues raised by Williamson. “The eyes of history are on all of us,” Swain said. “The people of Puerto Rico cannot afford to spend millions and millions of dollars in professional fees. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1GJ34I,Reuters,Neutral
"Huge waves slam into Puerto Rico, force evacuations",DANICA COTO,3/5/18,"Waves nearly 30 feet (9 meters) high from a U.S. winter storm slammed into Puerto Rico on Monday, forcing authorities to evacuate dozens of families and close roads and schools across the U.S. territory. Huge waves downed palm trees, knocked over cement benches and forced curious crowds to flee as saltwater flooded streets and homes along Puerto Rico’s northern and western coasts. More than a dozen streets remained closed, along with several beaches and two dozen schools in low-lying areas, a move that affected more than 6,000 students. The swell is the largest to hit Puerto Rico in more than a decade, and it is generating waves bigger than those produced by Hurricane Maria when it hit nearly six months ago as a Category 4 storm, said Gabriel Lojero, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Juan. “It continues to be very dangerous,” he told The Associated Press. The U.S. Coast Guard said it rescued an unidentified boogie boarder who apparently broke his wrist while surfing Sunday along Puerto Rico’s northwest coast. Government officials said another three people were rescued from a flooded motel in the northern town of Hatillo. The heavy swell also destroyed several docks and part of a government-owned boat terminal in Catano that provides ferry service to the historic part of Puerto Rico’s capital known as Old San Juan. Ferry service to the popular nearby islands of Vieques and Culebra also was cancelled. The ongoing damage comes as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, which caused up to an estimated $94 billion in damage. Forecasters said the swell also is affecting the U.S. Virgin Islands and is expected to last through Wednesday.","https://apnews.com/7afd3d83beca4f9381e53edc54689bc7/Huge-waves-slam-into-Puerto-Rico,-force-evacuations",AP,Neutral
Judge grants $300M loan for Puerto Rico power company,DANICA COTO,2/19/18,"A federal judge on Monday approved a $300 million loan for Puerto Rico’s power company that officials say will help keep the troubled agency operating until late March. The ruling comes just days after the judge had rejected an initial $1 billion loan request made by a federal control board overseeing the U.S. territory’s finances. The judge had said officials did not provide sufficient evidence proving Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority needed the money, so the board submitted a revised request for $300 million on Friday. Hours before the judge approved the request, Gov. Ricardo Rossello maintained that the company still needed a $1 billion loan to keep operating in the months ahead. “There’s no money,” he said. “We’re in a precarious situation.” The board did not immediately respond to requests for comment after the loan was approved. It had said in a previous filing that it plans to request more loans in upcoming weeks. Gerardo Portela, director of Puerto Rico’s financial authority, said in a statement that the power company will keep seeking all kinds of financing sources to help fund its operational and reconstruction needs. He also praised the judge’s ruling. “The approved financing will provide PREPA with a much-needed lifeline while safeguarding the operation in the near term,” he said. The initial $300 million would come out of the government’s general fund, but officials needed permission from the court to do so given that the island is undergoing a bankruptcy-like process to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt amid an 11-year recession. Rossello stressed that the U.S. territory is running out of money and also needs a separate, billion-dollar loan that U.S. Congress approved in October for disaster recovery. Federal officials said in December that they were withholding the funds because they believed the government still had enough cash available. The federal control board recently warned that Puerto Rico’s power company could see a $1.2 billion loss in revenue in the first six months after Hurricane Maria, which hit on Sept. 20 and destroyed two-thirds of the power distribution system. Nearly 250,000 customers remain without power more than five months after the Category 4 storm. On Sunday, government officials announced that they were reducing the power company’s operating reserve by 450 megawatts to help save $9 million a month. They said customers would not be affected but warned it could destabilize a power grid heavily damaged by the hurricane. The power company is $9 billion in debt, and Rossello announced in January that he plans to privatize the company in the next 18 months.",https://apnews.com/764f7c7dddf54339bcde3ec7857085ac/Judge-grants-$300M-loan-for-Puerto-Rico-power-company,AP,Neutral
Creditors cry foul on Puerto Rico's latest fiscal plan,Daniel Bases,2/14/18,"A large group of Puerto Rico’s creditors united on Wednesday in condemning the U.S. commonwealth’s revised fiscal plan, calling it a step backwards in rebuilding from years of mismanagement and the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Unveiled by Governor Ricardo Rossello on Tuesday, the plan highlighted the use of $18 billion in additional money from the U.S. federal budget to turn a deficit into a surplus of $3. 4 billion within six years. “The Plan fails to provide a credible basis on which to restructure the island’s debt, while completely lacking a foundation for revitalizing the local economy and restoring access to the capital markets,” the creditors said in a joint news release. Before the storms, the recovery plan had projected a nearly $4 billion surplus through 2021. But after the hurricanes, the government forecast a $3. 4 billion gap for the same period that would not allow any repayment of the island’s debt. Puerto Rico was already in crisis when Maria smashed into it. The bankrupt U.S. territory, whose finances the U.S. Congress placed under federal oversight, owed $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt. It had nearinsolvent public health and retirement systems, and was suffering from a shrinking population. The creditors say the new plan remains opaque on issues such defining essential services versus what the government wants to pay; not fully accounting for cash held in accounts that might be available to meet fiscal plan needs; not sharing 2015 audited financial statements; using an outdated migration forecast; and using healthcare cost and plan participation assumptions that contradict the government’s own outmigration forecast. Puerto Rico’s financial oversight board is expected to evaluate Rossello’s revised plan in the coming weeks and, after a public hearing, determine whether to certify it. The benchmark GO bond, trading in default without a yield, traded just under 60 U.S. cents on the dollar before Maria hit.

Cryptocurrency investors flock to Puerto Rico Investment Summit,Nick Brown,2/12/18,"i/File PhotoSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico () ,Puerto Rico’s annual investment summit, a twoday conference to woo investors to the bankrupt U.S. territory and the first since Hurricane Maria devastated the island, sported some new faces, particularly from the fastgrowing cryptocurrency world. The ranks of attendees and panelists on Monday were notably light on traditional mainstays, such as hedge fund creditors that hold the island’s $71. 5 billion in debt. Filling in some of the gaps were cryptocurrency investors, including Michael Terpin, who told the crowd at the Puerto Rico Convention Center he was the first from the crypto world to move to the island in 2016. Terpin, who also runs a public relations firm that works with cryptocurrency investors, said the industry is keen to take advantage of tax breaks under Puerto Rico’s Acts 20 and 22 that benefit wealthy job creators who move to Puerto Rico from other jurisdictions. “I hate it when I hear a talented person has to leave Puerto Rico because there’s no jobs here,” Terpin said. “We are bringing jobs. ”Puerto Rico is battling the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, $120 billion in combined pension and bond debt, and the effects of Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years which killed dozens and decimated an alreadyweak infrastructure in September. About 50 cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have relocated to Puerto Rico over the last year or two, and Terpin said he predicts that number will rise to 500 in the next 12 months. The island will host three separate cryptocurrency conferences over the next six weeks. Speaker Brock Pierce, cofounder of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm investing in blockchainenabled technology, said Puerto Rico has the mix of entrepreneurial spirit and tax benefits to make it an attractive launch pad for a what he views as a digital currency revolution. “We leave the pilot phase” in 2018, Pierce said. “We’ve been connecting all the dots, getting all the pieces in place.

"Blackout hits northern Puerto Rico following fire, explosion",No Author,2/11/18,"An explosion and fire at an electric substation threw much of northern Puerto Rico into darkness late Sunday in a setback for the U.S. territory’s efforts to fully restore power more than five months after Hurricane Maria started the longest blackout in U.S. history. The island’s Electric Power Authority said several municipalities were without power, including parts of the capital, San Juan, but they were optimistic it could be restored within a day as they worked to repair a substation that controls voltage. The blast illustrated the challenges of restoring a power grid that was already crumbling before it was devastated by the Category 4 hurricane. In many cases, power workers are repairing equipment that should have long been replaced but remained online due to the power authority’s yearslong financial crisis. PREPA is worth roughly $4 billion, carries $9 billion in debt and has long been criticized for political patronage and inefficiency. It also struggled with frequent blackouts, including an island-wide outage in September 2016. It was not immediately known what caused Sunday’s fire, which was quickly extinguished. Officials said the explosion knocked two other substations offline and caused a total loss of 400 megawatts worth of generation. “We are trying to restore that as quickly as possible,” the company said. Heavy black smoke billowed from the substation as neighbors in the area described on social media seeing the sky turn orange following a loud explosion. San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz tweeted that no injuries had been reported and that power had been restored in some areas of the city. The blackout comes as more than 400,000 power customers remain in the dark more than five months after Hurricane Maria. The storm destroyed two-thirds of the island’s power distribution system and caused up to an estimated $94 billion in damage. Puerto Rico’s governor announced last month that he plans to privatize the state-owned power company, which relies on infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average. It would be the largest restructuring of a public entity in U.S. history. One week after his announcement, a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances asked that a judge authorize a loan of up to $1. 3 billion so the power company can keep operating. The board said the company could see an estimated $1. 2 billion loss in revenue in the first six months after Hurricane Maria.","https://apnews.com/4b49c25c3cc94a8aba57acb90c99a685/Blackout-hits-northern-Puerto-Rico-following-fire,-explosion",AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico says to receive $16 billion in federal disaster aid,Nick Brown,2/9/18,"Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump. Slideshow ( 2 images )That money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September’s Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress. Rossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4. 9 billion to shore up its nearinsolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid. On Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said. In addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt. The aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $94. 4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock, although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $45 billion, according to Friday’s statement. Congress could also appropriate more money later. The governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone. Home damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of substandard “informal” homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities. “The work carried out in Washington ,together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González ,was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,” the governor said in Friday’s statement. The disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday ,around $90 billion in total ,covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-storm-aid-idUSKBN1FU00V,Reuters,Neutral
"Special Report: In Puerto Rico, a housing crisis U.S. storm aid won't solve",Nick Brown,2/6/18,"Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo. The illegal shantytown emerged on a public wetland after 1989’s Hurricane Hugo left thousands homeless. The depths of Puerto Rico's housing crisis exposed by Maria The depths of Puerto Rico's housing crisis exposed by Maria02:09About 6,000 squatters landed here, near the El Yunque National Forest, and built makeshift homes on 40 acres that span a lowlying valley and its adjacent mountainside. Wood and concrete dwellings, their facades scrawled with invented addresses, sit on cinder blocks. After Maria, many are missing roofs; some have collapsed altogether. Amid the rubble, 59yearold Joe Quirindongo sat in the sun one recent day on a wooden platform ,the only remaining piece of his home. Softspoken with weathered skin and a buzzcut, Quirindongo pondered his limited options. “I know this isn’t a good place for a house,” said Quirindongo, who survives on U.S. government assistance. “Sometimes I would like to go to another place, but I can’t afford anything. ”Villa Hugo reflects a much larger crisis in this impoverished U.S. territory, where socalled “informal” homes are estimated to house about half the population of 3. 4 million. Some residents built on land they never owned. Others illegally subdivided properties, often so family members could build on their lots. Most have no title to their homes, which are constructed without permits and usually not up to building codes. The houses range in quality and size, from oneroom shacks to sizable family homes. Many have plumbing and power, though not always through official means. (For a Wider Image photo essay on the island's postMaria housing crisis, see: reut. rs/2EJmIq3 )The concentration of illegal housing presents a vexing dilemma for local and federal authorities already overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding an economically depressed island after its worst natural disaster in nine decades. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló has stressed the need to “build back better,” a sentiment echoed by U.S. disaster relief and housing officials. But rebuilding to modern standards or relocating squatters to new homes would take an investment far beyond reimbursing residents for lost property value. It’s an outlay Puerto Rico’s government says it can’t afford, and which U.S. officials say is beyond the scope of their funding and mission. Yet the alternative ,as Villa Hugo shows ,is to encourage rebuilding of the kind of substandard housing that made the island so vulnerable to Maria in the first place. “It’s definitely a housing crisis,” said Fernando Gil, Puerto Rico’s housing secretary. “It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it. ”In Puerto Rico, housing is by far the largest category of storm destruction, estimated by the island government at about $37 billion, with only a small portion covered by insurance. That’s more than twice the government’s estimate for catastrophic electric grid damage, which was made far worse by the shoddy state of utility infrastructure before the storm. Puerto Rico officials did not respond to questions about how the territory estimated the damage to illegally built homes. Maria destroyed or significantly damaged more than a third of about 1. 2 million occupied homes on the island, the government estimates. Most of those victims had no hazard insurance ,which is only required for mortgageholders in Puerto Rico ,and no flood insurance. Just 344,000 homes on the island have mortgages, according U.S. Census Bureau data. Officials at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) acknowledged the unique challenges of delivering critical housing aid to Puerto Rico. Among them: calculating the damage to illegal, often substandard homes; persuading storm victims to follow through on application processes that have frustrated many into giving up; and allocating billions in disaster aid that still won’t be nearly enough solve the island’s housing crisis. By far the most money for Puerto Rico housing aid is expected to come from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD spokeswoman Caitlin Thompson declined to comment on how the agency would spend billions of dollars in disaster relief funds to rebuild housing, or how it planned to help owners of informally built homes. Two HUD officials overseeing the agency’s Puerto Rico relief efforts, Todd Richardson and Stan Gimont, also declined to comment. But the disaster aid package currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress would provide far less housing aid than Puerto Rico officials say they need. Governor Rosselló is seeking $46 billion in aid from HUD, an amount that dwarfs previous allocations for even the most destructive U.S. storms. That’s nearly half the island’s total relief request of $94 billion. The U.S. House of Representatives instead passed a package of $81 billion, with $26 billion for HUD, that still needs Senate and White House approval. The money would be divided between regions struck by several 2017 hurricanes ,including Maria, Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida ,as well as the recent California wildfires. Congress could also decide to approve additional aid later. ‘MY MOTHER IS SCARED’A generation ago, Maria Vega Lastra, now 61, was among the estimated 28,000 people displaced by Hurricane Hugo. Neighbors helped her build a new home in what would become Villa Hugo, in the town of Canóvanas. Her daughter, 34yearold Amadaliz Diaz, still recalls her older brother grinning as he sawed wood for the frame of their selfbuilt, onefloor house, with a porch and three bedrooms. Now, Vega Lastra’s roof has holes in it, and her waterlogged wooden floorboards buckle with each step. Vega Lastra has been staying with her daughter, who lives in Tampa, as the family waits on applications for FEMA aid. The agency initially denied her application in December, saying it could not contact her by phone, Diaz said. Slideshow ( 10 images )Vega Lastra is returning to her home this week, uncertain if its condition has gotten worse. Her daughter bought her an air mattress to take with her. “My mother is scared,” Diaz said. “I hope the government helps her. I work, but I have three kids to take care of. ”The island’s housing crisis long predated the storm. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency data, Puerto Rico’s index of new home prices fell 25 percent over the last decade, amid a severe recession that culminated last May in the largest government bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. Legal home construction, meanwhile, plummeted from nearly 16,000 new units in 2004 to less than 2,500 last year, according to consultancy Estudios Tecnicos, an economic data firm. A 2007 study by environmental consultant Interviron Services Inc, commissioned by the Puerto Rico Builders Association, found that 55 percent of residential and commercial construction was informal. That would work out to nearly 700,000 homes. That figure might be high, said David Carrasquillo, president of the Puerto Rico Planning Society, a trade group representing community planners. But even a “very conservative” estimate would yield at least 260,000 illegally built houses, he said. Generations of Puerto Rican governments never made serious efforts to enforce building codes to stop new illegal housing, current and former island officials said in interviews. Past administrations had little political or economic incentive to force people out of neighborhoods like Villa Hugo. Former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, in office during Hurricane Hugo, said he tried to help informal homeowners without policing them. “Our policy was not to relocate, but rather improve those places,” Hernandez Colon said in an interview. Subsequent administrations advocated similar policies; none made meaningful headway, partly because of Puerto Rico’s constant political turnover. Today, informal communities provide a stark contrast to San Juan’s glittering resorts and bustling business districts. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz pointed to poor barrios like those near the city’s Martín Peña Channel, hidden behind the skyscrapers of the financial hub known as the Golden Mile. “It’s not something I’m proud of, but we hide our poverty here,” Cruz said in an interview. RECOVERY DILEMMAThe task of rebuilding Puerto Rico’s housing stock ultimately falls to the territory government, which has no ability to pay for it after racking up $120 billion in bond and pension debt in the years before the storm. That leaves the island dependent on U.S. relief from FEMA, the SBA and HUD. The SBA offers lowinterest home repair loans of up to $200,000. FEMA provides homeowners with emergency grants, relocation assistance and other help. HUD is focused on longterm rebuilding efforts, working directly with local agencies to subsidize reconstruction through grants. FEMA’s cap for disaster aid to individuals is $33,300, and actual awards are often much lower. Normally, FEMA eligibility for housing aid requires proving property ownership, but the agency says it will help owners of informal homes if they can prove residency. How exactly to help gets complicated. For example, someone who builds their own home with no permits on land they own is more likely to be treated as a homeowner, said Justo Hernandez, FEMA’s deputy federal coordinating officer. Squatters who built on land they didn’t own, however, would likely only be given money to cover lost items and relocate to a rental, he said. Several Villa Hugo residents said they received money from FEMA, but many didn’t know what it was for and complained it wasn’t enough. Lourdes Rios Romero, 59, plans to appeal the $6,000 grant she got for repairs to her flooded home, citing a much higher contractor’s quote. Neighbor Miguel Rosario Lopez, a 62yearold retiree, showed a statement from FEMA saying he was eligible for $916. 22, “to perform essential repairs that will allow you to live in your home. ”Without money for major changes, most homeowners said they planned to combine the aid they might get from FEMA with what little money they could raise to rebuild in the same spot. FEMA does not police illegal building. Code enforcement is left to the same local authorities who have allowed illegal construction to persist for years. Quirindongo is planning to buy materials to rebuild his Villa Hugo home himself with about $4,000 from FEMA. It will be the third time he has done so, having lost one home to a 2011 flood, another to a fire. “I just want to have something that I can say, ‘This is mine,’” Quirindongo said. Slideshow ( 10 images )GIVING UPMany others appear to have given up on FEMA aid because the agency’s application process is entangled with a separate process for awarding SBA loans to rebuild homes. FEMA is legally bound to assess whether applicants might qualify for SBA loans before awarding them FEMA grants. If an applicant passes FEMA’s cursory eligibility assessment, they are automatically referred to SBA for a more thorough screening. Applicants are not required to follow through on the SBA process ,but they cannot qualify for FEMA aid unless they do. FEMA only provides a grant when the SBA denies the applicant a loan. FEMA said it has referred about 520,000 people out of 1. 1 million total applicants so far to the SBA. But as of Monday, only 59,000 followed through with SBA applications. Of those, some 12,000 later withdrew, SBA data shows. “As soon as people see SBA they say, ‘I give up, I don’t want a loan ,I can’t afford a loan,’” FEMA’s Hernandez said. SBA spokeswoman Carol Chastang said the agency is working with FEMA to educate flood victims on available benefits and the application process, including sending staffers to applicants’ homes. 330,000 VACANT HOMESBefore the storm hit, Puerto Rico already had about 330,000 vacant homes, according to Census Bureau 2016 estimates, resulting from years of population decline as citizens migrated to the mainland United States and elsewhere. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can move to the mainland at will. Puerto Rico and federal officials have considered rehabilitating the vacant housing for short,and longterm use, along with building new homes and buying out homeowners in illegally built neighborhoods, according to Gil and federal officials. Rosselló, the Puerto Rican governor, has said the rebuilding plan must include a fleet of properly built new homes. Gil, the housing secretary, said the administration would like to build as many as 70,000 properties. HUD officials declined to comment on whether the agency would finance new housing. Its Community Development Block Grant program allows for local governments to design their own solutions and seek HUD approval for funding. The cost of constructing enough new, codecompliant properties to house people displaced by Maria could far exceed the available federal aid. Making them affordable also presents a problem. Puerto Rico’s subsidized “social interest housing,” geared toward lowincome buyers, typically provides units that sell in the mid$100,000 range, with prices capped by the government. That’s beyond the means of many displaced storm victims. Gil offered little detail on a solution beyond saying it will include a mix of new development, buyout programs for owners of illegally built homes and other options. The answer will come down to how much Washington is willing to pay, he said. He invoked the island’s territorial status and colonial history as a root cause of its poor infrastructure and housing stock before the storm. “It is precisely because we have been neglected by the federal government that the island’s infrastructure is so weak,” he said. Many Puerto Rico officials continue to advocate for bringing relief and legitimacy to squatter communities like Villa Hugo, rather than trying to relocate their residents. Canovanas Mayor Lornna Soto has been negotiating with island officials to provide property titles to Villa Hugo’s population. The vast majority still don’t have them. “It’s long overdue to recognize that they are not going anywhere and their communities need to be rebuilt with proper services,” Soto said. Diaz said she supports her mother’s decision to return to Villa Hugo, regardless of what aid the government ultimately provides. “I grew up there,” Diaz said. “Everyone knows us there. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-housing-specialreport-idUSKBN1FQ211,Reuters,Neutral
FEMA contractor did not deliver millions of Puerto Rico meals: lawmakers,Reuters Staff,2/6/18,"The U.S. agency responsible for disaster response hired a contractor that failed to deliver millions of emergency meals in hurricaneravaged Puerto Rico last year, U.S. Democratic lawmakers said on Tuesday. FEMA contractor fails to deliver promised meals to Puerto Rico FEMA contractor fails to deliver promised meals to Puerto Rico01:04Democrats on the House Oversight Committee cited records that showed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded a nearly $156 million contract to a oneperson company that delivered just 50,000 of the expected 30 million meals. The lawmakers said documents showed the company, Atlantabased Tribute Contracting, had a history of problems handling smaller government contracts worth less than $100,000 and had been barred from government work until 2019. Representatives for Tribute and its owner, Tiffany Brown, did not respond to requests for comment. Puerto Rico is struggling to recover from its worst natural disaster in 90 years and the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with some $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt. Hurricane Maria killed dozens and left Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million U.S. citizens without power when it struck on Sept. 20, along with reducing access to clean water and other essentials. FEMA last month said it would continue to provide water, meals and other basic needs after earlier reports that it was going to halt aid. The House committee’s announcement follows an earlier controversy involving contractor Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana firm hired to restore the island’s power despite a lack of experience. Governor Ricardo Rossello later canceled that deal. After winning the October 2017 FEMA contract, Tribute delivered just 50,000 meals to the U.S. territory and was terminated for cause 20 days later, said Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee’s top Democrat. “It is unclear why FEMA or any agency would have proceeded with a contract worth $156 million in light of this company’s poor contracting history and these explicit warnings,” he wrote, citing documents obtained by panel Democrats. Cummings and fellow Democrat Stacey Plaskett called on the panel’s Republican chairman, Trey Gowdy, to subpoena FEMA for documents on the company and its alleged failure to deliver millions of meals. Gowdy’s spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said that sending a subpoena was premature but that the panel would continue to review hurricane recovery efforts. FEMA said it could not comment on Tribute, but that at the time the contract was terminated food distribution in Puerto Rico “was not affected. ”Agency spokeswoman Jenny Burke said meals continue to be provided on the island and that “there are sufficient commodities both in Puerto Rico and on the mainland to continue to meet identified needs for current or future disasters. ”A website for Brown shows her other companies include beauty, fashion, interior design and health and wellness businesses.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-meals-idUSKBN1FQ2OP,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico’s gov seeks charter schools, raises for teachers",DANICA COTO,2/5/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Monday that he will push to create charter schools and vouchers and give all public school teachers their first raise in a decade as part of a plan to transform the U.S. territory’s education system. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said he will submit proposed legislation Tuesday that also would strengthen vocational schools, allow parents to have more freedom in choosing a child’s school and create an island-wide bilingual model that prioritizes subjects including math and science. Rossello noted Puerto Rico’s education department has long been known for its bureaucracy and failure to set aside money for classroom supplies, among many other problems. Parents have long complained about a lack of teachers, some of whom are not paid on time. “A full faculty will be assigned for each school,” the governor said. “We cannot accept that students and parents have to endure being without an appointed teacher.” The announcement comes as Puerto Rico faces a sharp drop in enrollment, with 25,000 students alone leaving since Hurricane Maria hit in September. More than five months later, some 270 schools are still without power. Officials say they expect to lose 54,000 students overall in the next four years as the island struggles to recover from the storm amid an 11-year-old recession. The school system already saw enrollment drop by 78,000 students the past four years. Rossello said his new public policy aims to decentralize the Department of Education in part to increase accountability and ensure that 70 percent of the budget reaches schools. In addition to implementing charter schools, he said the educational voucher program will start in the 2019-2020 school year. Rossello’s party has the majority in both the island’s House and Senate, and several legislators said they would support his proposal. But critics called the plan a first step in privatizing the education system just days after Rossello announced he aims to privatize Puerto Rico’s power company. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, accused Rossello of abandoning public schools. “To say that schools that have already been starved should be further starved so he can privatize options is an abandonment of public education,” she said in a phone interview. “He’s proposing to create more austerity.” Rossello recently submitted a fiscal plan that calls for the closure of 300 schools, a measure that union leaders including Weingarten have criticized. Last year, education officials announced that they would be closing more than 150 public schools as a result of the drop in enrollment. Overall, Puerto Rico has 1,110 public schools and 319,000 students. Jaime Morales, who has been a public school teacher for 18 years, said in a phone interview that even though Rossello plans to give teachers a $1,500 annual salary increase, it’s not enough. “We can’t make ends meet with the cost of living,” he said, adding that teachers are often forced to buy their own supplies. “Books are scarce.” Education Secretary Julia Keleher told The Associated Press that when she was appointed to oversee the public school system, she was most shocked by its lack of equity, saying some schools received their full $7,000-per-student funding while others got $2,000. “It became obvious that the system isn’t driven by what’s best for the student, and that there’s an enormous bureaucracy,” she said. “The system has a lot of problems.”","https://apnews.com/e2cdc8a1d97a4cd4b0239d3fd05a8c18/Puerto-Rico's-gov-seeks-charter-schools,-raises-for-teachers",AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor announces public education overhaul,Nick Brown,2/5/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor said his administration will unveil a broad education reform bill on Tuesday aimed at incorporating school vouchers and charter schools into the bankrupt U.S. territory’s education system. FILE PHOTO: Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello speaks during a Facebook live broadcast in the library of the governor's mansion, in San Juan, Puerto Rico January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin BaezSpeaking in a televised address on Monday, Governor Ricardo Rossello also said every public school teacher in Puerto Rico would receive a $1,500 annual salary increase beginning next school year. It was unclear whether the pay bump would require legislation. The governor’s remarks came 10 days after the island’s education secretary, Julia Keleher, said she planned to decentralize Puerto Rico’s education department and introduce “autonomous schools. ”Public school reform is a touchy issue in the U.S. territory, where teachers make an average of about $27,000 a year. But Puerto Rico, struggling simultaneously through the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history and the aftermath of September’s Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, is trying to embrace muchneeded structural reforms. Its public school system, organized as a single, islandwide district, is among the weakest in the United States and long plagued by bloated administrative spending. In some age groups, less than 10 percent of students meet federal testing standards. Keleher, a former U.S. Department of Education official and private consultant, has worked with past Puerto Rican administrations on similar reform efforts that did not become law. In a written statement following the address, Rossello said Puerto Rico has “students and teachers with extraordinary talent. ”“What we are lacking is a system that allows them to develop those talents,” he said. The plan met with immediate scorn from the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 40,000 educators in Puerto Rico. AFT President Randi Weingarten told  the plan “doesn’t add up,” saying salary bumps will do nothing without more investment in schools. “There’s a lot of nice flowery language in here, but . . . you can’t actually do the things [Rossello] is talking about doing and still divert resources from public schools,” Weingarten said. The voucher program, projected to begin during the 20192020 school year, would allow parents to choose public or private school alternatives, but may face legal hurdles. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court struck down a similar proposed voucher program in 1994, during the administration of Rossello’s father, former Governor Pedro Rossello, saying the island’s constitution prohibited using public money to fund privatelyrun schools. Puerto Rico is facing a crippling $120 billion bond and pension debt load, and filed a form of bankruptcy last May. Four months later, it was hit by successive hurricanes, the second of which, Maria, devastated the island’s outdated infrastructure, killed dozens, and damaged school buildings to the tune of $8. 4 billion.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-education-idUSKBN1FP2RV,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board wants changes to island's fiscal plan,Nick Brown,2/5/18,"Puerto Rico’s financial oversight board told the bankrupt island’s governor on Monday to revise his proposed fiscal turnaround plan to add more detail on labor and other reforms, and to create room in the budget for a $1. 3 billion emergency fund. Slideshow ( 9 images )In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello, the federally appointed, sevenmember panel set a Feb. 12 deadline for the new draft, which will chart Puerto Rico’s plan to regain economic stability. The U.S. territory is struggling to recover from September’s Hurricane Maria ,its worst storm in 90 years ,while also navigating the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt. Rossello’s draft turnaround plan, submitted on Jan. 24, projected a $3. 4 billion budget gap that would bar the island from repaying a penny of its debt until 2022. While the plan included subsidy cuts to cities and towns and the streamlining of public agencies, the board, which must approve the plan, demanded more details in Monday’s eightpage letter. The board wants an emergency reserve of $650 million in the next five years and $1. 3 billion within 10 years, “based on best practices for states and territories regularly impacted by storms,” it said. It also wants more details on key structural reforms, notably labor. The board suggested that Rossello make Puerto Rico an atwill employer and make severance and Christmas bonuses optional, both of which are norms among U.S. states. The board criticized Rossello’s proposed reduction of capital expenditures to $400 million a year, saying there had “been no project or agencyspecific analysis” to support that figure and that the plan should provide for expenditures “necessary to maintain assets of the commonwealth. ”The board also sought more detail on Rossello’s vision for Puerto Rico’s energy grid, which was decimated by Maria. Rossello has announced plans to privatize Puerto Rico’s bankrupt, quasipublic power utility, PREPA. But the governor’s plan must “support a transaction by providing a set of targets for a potential bidder to meet or exceed during the bidding process,” the board said. It said the plan should provide a fiveyear outlook for financial stability at the utility, and for the creation of an independent energy regulator with commissioners appointed by the governor, from a candidate list developed by an independent expert panel.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-fiscalplan-idUSKBN1FP2X8,Reuters,Neutral
"U.S. agency says will keep providing water, other essentials in Puerto Rico",Nick Brown,1/31/18,"The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said on Wednesday it would continue providing water, meals and other essentials to hurricaneravaged Puerto Rico despite earlier reports its humanitarian mission in the U.S. territory would end on Wednesday. “There was never, and is not now, a decision to stop distributing commodities on the island,” FEMA said in a written statement on Wednesday evening. Puerto Rico is struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, which hit on Sept. 20. The storm killed dozens and left the entire island without power at a time when it was already trudging through the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with some $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt. Some Puerto Rican and U.S. politicians had criticized FEMA this week after NPR reported on Monday that FEMA’s mission in Puerto Rico was coming to an end, citing a spokesman for the agency. On Tuesday, FEMA reversed course, saying the initial Jan. 31 end date had been relayed in error. Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, speaking on the Senate Floor on Monday, had said it would be “unconscionable” and “a travesty” to cut off aid in Puerto Rico, where nearly a third of the island’s 3. 4 million U.S. citizens still lack power more than four months after the storm. Eventually, FEMA will hand over responsibility for humanitarian aid to Puerto Rico’s government. Amid the confusion over the timing of that transition, Puerto Rico’s public safety director, Hector Pesquera, said on Tuesday his administration was still negotiating with FEMA on the timing of the handover. “We have yet to finish the discussions about when the transition should start,” Pesquera said. “It is important to note that this transition period should last at least two weeks. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-storm-fema-idUSKBN1FK3BB,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. judge tosses creditor lawsuit over Puerto Rico revenue 'clawbacks',Nick Brown,1/30/18,"A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by some of Puerto Rico’s bondholders, who had argued that the U.S. territory broke the law by defaulting on constitutionallyguaranteed debt despite having the money to make payments. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, did not address the merits of the bondholders’ claims, concluding that she lacked jurisdiction over some of them, and that others were not fit to be ruled on. The dismissal is a setback to owners of roughly $18 billion in general obligation (GO) bonds guaranteed by Puerto Rico’s constitution and taxing power. A win would have helped establish the top priority of GO debt relative to other credits in Puerto Rico, a central question as warring creditor classes litigate competing claims to the island’s limited funding streams. Puerto Rico has $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and its finances are under the oversight of a federallyappointed board. Last May, the island filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history. With creditors already expecting drastic cuts to repayments, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September, killing dozens, decimating local infrastructure, and sending bond prices plummeting as low as 20 cents on the dollar. GO bondholders have accused the oversight board and the Puerto Rican government of unlawfully steering revenues away from them. In the lawsuit, which was filed in June, a group of these bondholders, led by Aurelius Capital Management, alleged the island’s government had violated Puerto Rican law and the U.S. constitution by paying for government services with revenues it diverted from other reserves. They argued that, under Puerto Rican law, these socalled revenue “clawbacks” could only be used to pay GO debt. Puerto Rico used some $940 million in clawbacks and other restricted cash to fund government services in fiscal year 2017, they alleged. Judge Swain, in a 19page ruling on Tuesday, said she lacked jurisdiction over some claims. Others, she said, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, amounting “to abstract declarations of the parties’ respective relationships” without application to a “current concrete dispute. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-lawsuit-idUSKBN1FJ357,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico sees no debt payment ability until 2022,Nick Brown,1/24/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor projected his bankrupt, hurricaneravaged U.S. territory will carry budget gaps for the next four fiscal years, leaving nothing to pay back the island’s $72 billion in bond debt until fiscal year 2022. Governor Ricardo Rossello made the projections in a revised fiscal turnaround plan released overnight on Thursday. The plan assumes a minimum of $35. 3 billion in federal aid to help the island recover from Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in September, through the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) public assistance program. A previous turnaround plan, approved by Puerto Rico’s federally appointed financial oversight board last April, had projected $800 million a year for debt repayment, roughly a quarter of what it needs annually. That was before Maria slammed Puerto Rico, killing dozens, cutting power to all 3. 4 million residents, and damaging and destroying tens of billions of dollars in housing. The new plan projects that Maria will spur increased inflation and nearly triple a contraction in gross national product this fiscal year, as well as drive some 600,000 more people from the island in the next five years. That outlook led to a projected annual budget gap of around $8 billion, Rossello said at a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday. The government whittled that gap down to between $2 billion and $3. 5 billion, through reforms like subsidy cuts to towns and the University of Puerto Rico, measures to boost tax collection, improvements to government procurement, and the streamlining of public agencies. A small surplus is seen for the first time in fiscal 2022. “One of the main pillars of the fiscal plan is that we achieve structural balance by fiscal 2022,” Rossello said. The figures will likely change. The island’s oversight board can request tweaks and must approve a final version by late February. FEDERAL AIDThe $35. 3 billion minimum projection by Rossello for federal disaster aid is derived from FEMA’s public assistance program, which provides money to governments for debris removal, lifesaving measures and public facility repairs. Rossello said the projection was based on FEMA’s own estimates and that the program “has been legislated and has never been underfunded. ”The governor is seeking a total of $94 billion in federal aid, though the latest disaster aid package currently under discussion in the U.S. Congress is much smaller. Even before Maria, Puerto Rico was reeling under $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt and a poverty rate around 46 percent. It filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history last May. Although creditors are expected to take dramatic repayment cuts in the bankruptcy, they may balk at the prospect of no payment for five years. Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 general obligation debt, which trades like an equity given that it is in default, last traded at 27. 495 cents on the dollar. The bond was issued in 2014 with an 8 percent coupon. In an interview with  on Wednesday, Natalie Jaresko, the executive director of the oversight board, downplayed the significance of a potential budget gap, stressing the importance of longterm structural changes like labor reform. At the time of the interview, Jaresko said she had not seen the plan, but that even if no money were available to pay debt for five years, “that doesn’t mean there’s not money available in years six through 30. ”“I know your readers are the creditors,” she said, “but for them, for all stakeholders, for people who live on this island and want to see jobs and better education and better healthcare results, the structural reforms are equally if not more important. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-fiscalplan-idUSL2N1PK00V,Reuters,Neutral
"Hope, fear as Puerto Rico moves to privatize power company",DANICA COTO,1/23/18,"One of the largest public utilities in the U.S. might soon be up for sale, but many wonder who would want to buy a power company that is worth roughly half of the $9 billion debt it holds and has an infrastructure nearly three times older than the industry average. Concerns also are growing about whether plans to privatize Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority will translate into more affordable electric bills and better service. People in the U.S. territory say they cannot afford another financial blow amid an 11-year-old recession and many complain about receiving high power bills after Hurricane Maria when they didn’t even have electricity. “Some people have faith that privatization will improve everything, but it’s not a guarantee,” said Puerto Rico economist Jose Caraballo. “If a good deal isn’t hammered out, Puerto Rico can end up worse than it is.” The power company once known as the government’s crown jewel has seen a reduction in employees and a drop in the demand for energy amid a deep economic crisis and recent austerity measures. The agency now has some 5,800 employees and serves nearly 1.5 million customers with infrastructure that is roughly 45 years old, which officials say caused frequent power outages before the hurricane and an island-wide blackout in September 2016 that lasted a couple of days. The company also has long been criticized for political patronage and inefficiency, and recently faced accusations of corruption. In June 2016, the owner of the U.S. territory’s biggest oil supplier was arrested after being charged with misappropriating $11 million in public funds. Jose Gonzalez Amador and his company, PetroWest, are accused of charging the power company a 0.5 percent municipal tax even though some municipalities granted them a lower rate or waived the tax altogether. Authorities say the charge was then passed on to consumers. Given that situation, can the U.S. territory attract any takers? Industry analysts say it’s a bit too early to tell, noting that it all depends on the type of measure the governor expects to submit in upcoming days to start the privatization process. “It’s a complicated arrangement: What’s going to happen to the workers? Where is the debt going to land? What are the contracts going to look like? There are a lot of details here that have very real implications on how much electricity is going to cost for Puerto Rican customers,” said Cathy Kunkel, an energy analyst with the Ohio-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. She said her main concern is that privatization could occur without a regulatory body, which is needed in part to look after consumers’ interests on an island where power bills have been double the average of those on the U.S. mainland, in part because imported fuel supplies three-fourths of the energy consumed in Puerto Rico, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The terms of the contract will determine the interest, Kunkel said, noting that the cost of any new investment in the electrical system will be paid by consumers. “Private investors will want to make a profit,” she said. “But you have to contrast that with the waste and mismanagement that the (power company) has shown over the years.” Any sale would have to be approved by a federal judge because the power company entered a bankruptcy-like process last year, and approval is first needed from legislators, which is unclear will happen. Puerto Rico Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz said Tuesday that he will study the upcoming measure to ensure it’s in the best interest of Puerto Rico and no one else. “Privatization can be a great tool, but it is not a magic wand,” he said, noting that Puerto Rico once privatized its water and sewer company only to have the government take it back in the early 2000s after problems with service, billing and quality requirements set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If legislators approve the governor’s measure, then Gov. Ricardo Rossello said his administration will monitor the market and start accepting offers from those interested in buying the power company’s assets. He said privatization would both improve service and lower power bills to about 20 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with the U.S. average of 10 cents per kilowatt hour. He also predicted it would lead to more investment in renewable energy projects. Rossello said the electrical grid is not designed for Puerto Rico’s current needs, noting that the greatest demand exists in the north part of the island while the main generation plants are in the south. In addition to its aging infrastructure, the company known by its initials PREPA has lost 30 percent of its employees in the last five years, 86 percent of whom worked in maintenance, he added. The company also has faced internal turmoil. Its director was forced out in November after the utility failed to immediately call for help from its mainland counterparts after Hurricane Maria. Instead, PREPA granted a power-restoration contract to a little-known company that the utility later scrapped. Most recently, PREPA was blamed for the failure to distribute badly needed parts found in one of its warehouses even as repairs to the storm-damaged power system went undone for lack of supplies. Monday’s announcement by Rossello comes as more than 30 percent of customers remain without electricity more than four months after Hurricane Maria, and critics say he took advantage of that situation to rally support for his plan. Union leader Angel Figueroa said Tuesday that workers oppose the governor’s plan but will not go on strike, noting that nearly half a million Puerto Ricans are still without power. However, he said the union will take other undisclosed measures, noting they have the support of unions that represent other types of workers including teachers. “It’s not every man for himself,” he said. “Everyone here will be affected.” Figueroa warned that power bills would only increase given the drop in demand for electricity in recent years as roughly half a million Puerto Ricans have fled for the U.S. mainland, and especially if a private company decides to invest in new infrastructure. Rossello has said the privatization process could take 18 months, a timeframe that Moody’s on Tuesday called “quite aggressive.” The agency said it supports privatization because it would bring in more capital, but noted that challenges remain, including “negotiating a price in an environment of declining Puerto Rico population, investing in rebuilding aging infrastructure, and how PREPA’s pension liability will be handled.”","https://apnews.com/debbd4bd0bea4ffa94942098d0876129/Hope,-fear-as-Puerto-Rico-moves-to-privatize-power-company",AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico to sell off crippled power utility PREPA,Daniel Bases,1/22/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor said on Monday he intends to sell off the U.S. territory’s troubled power utility to the private sector, saying the process could take roughly 18 months to complete. A worker of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority (PREPA) repairs part of the electrical grid after Hurricane Maria hit the area in September, in Manati, Puerto Rico October 30, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has yet to recover fully from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria, which in late September knocked out power to the entire island, leaving all 3. 4 million residents in the dark and killing dozens of people. “The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement. “What we know today as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority does not work and cannot continue to operate like this. ”Less than 64 percent of homes and businesses are receiving power, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Energy. PREPA had promised that most of the island would have power by the end of December. The new plan calls for 30 percent of power generation to be from renewable sources. Rossello described how the process for breaking up the company would occur in three phases, calling it a move toward a “consumercentered model. ”Phase one consists of defining the legal framework via legislation. Phase two will be evaluating bids, and phase three will be “the terms of awarding and hiring the selected companies that meet the requirements for the transformation and modernization of our energy system will be negotiated. ”Given PREPA is currently trying to work its way through bankruptcy and all of the island’s financial dealings must go through the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, selling off PREPA’s assets could be a long process. Rossello highlighted how the island’s electrical grid, which was severely dilapidated prior to the storms, was obsolete and working off of a generation system that was 28 years older than the average electric power utility in the United States. Proceeds from the sale of assets and contracts would be “used to capitalize the retirement funds of employees,” Rossello said. OVERBURDENED, OVERINDEBTED, UNDERINVESTEDPREPA has been hampered by years of underinvestment, frequent turnover in management and inefficient collections that forced it to go deeply into debt. The utility incurred about $9 billion in debt before declaring bankruptcy in July. Slideshow ( 5 images )An ad hoc group of investors holding much of the utility’s $9 billion in bonds welcomed privatizing the utility. “We believe the American citizens that live in Puerto Rico would be better served by an electric utility run by a private operator with a proven track record, installed immediately, subject to existing PREC oversight and free from government interference,” the group said in a statement, referring to the Puerto Rico Energy Commission. Last September after Hurricane Maria PREPA rejected a $1 billion loan and a discount on a portion of the existing debt offered by its creditors. The utility was criticized for its restoration efforts, particularly its now canceled $300 million contract with tiny Montanabased Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC which was obtained without competitive public bidding. The Oversight Board did not have an immediate comment when contacted by . Attempts to reach PREPA’s corporate offices were unsuccessful. PREPA Board members contacted by  had not heard of the governor’s suggested privatization of the company, and because the matter was still a preliminary idea, they declined to comment. One analyst was skeptical of Rossello’s plan. “He’s got no energy plan, no financial analysis, if he thinks he’s going to sell it off and the private sector is going to come in and invest, that is a recipe for Puerto Rico being raked over the coals by private interests,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Cleveland, Ohiobased Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “This will produce a maximum amount of corruption and a minimal amount of electricity,” said Sanzillo, whose organization has provided expert witnesses to PREC proceedings.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-power-prepa-idUSKBN1FB31M,Reuters,Neutral
US withholds hurricane emergency loan sought by Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,1/17/18,"A billion-dollar emergency loan approved by Congress to help Puerto Rico deal with the effects of Hurricane Maria has been temporarily withheld by federal officials who say the U.S. territory is not facing a cash shortage like it has repeatedly warned about in recent months. Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Treasury Department said in a letter to the director of the island’s fiscal agency that Puerto Rico has had a central cash balance exceeding $1.5 billion in the nearly four months since the Category 4 storm. Federal officials also noted the local government released documents in late December showing it had nearly $7 billion available in cash. The letter was first published Wednesday by the newspaper El Nuevo Dia. Federal officials said the U.S. government will create a cash balance policy to determine when the funds will be released via the Community Disaster Loan Program. They said in the letter that the cash balance level will be decided on by the federal government in consultation with Puerto Rico officials and a federal control board overseeing the island’s finances. Once the central cash balance decreases to that level, the funds will be released, officials said. They added that Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities could separately apply for loans. The announcement came just weeks after the control board rejected legislation that would have created a $100 million emergency fund for municipalities struggling in the hurricane’s aftermath. Local officials have warned that Puerto Rico’s power and water and sewer companies will run out of money this month. Both companies say their funds have dwindled since the storm caused up to an estimated $95 billion in damage, knocking out power to the entire island. Nearly 40 percent of power customers remain in the dark. On Wednesday, Gov. Ricardo Rossello announced he had signed a measure prohibiting the power company from charging customers for power produced by private generators. A growing number of Puerto Ricans have complained about receiving such bills. Gerardo Portela, director of the island’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, said in a statement Wednesday that he has urged federal officials to finalize under what terms and conditions they would distribute federal funds already approved by U.S. lawmakers. He said the delay has forced local officials to start a process in which the central government would loan money to Puerto Rico’s power and water and sewer companies. “These public corporations are facing severe liquidity problems that threaten essential services to the people of Puerto Rico if their operations are interrupted for lack of immediate action,” he said. Puerto Rico Rep. Luis Vega Ramos called the decision by federal officials to withhold money a “rogue move.” He said that while the lack of transparency and other issues within Rossello’s administration has led to the situation, it remained unacceptable. “The administration of President Donald Trump, through FEMA, is extorting the people of Puerto Rico and our government so that it submits itself even further to the federal control board and new austerity measures,” he said. A spokeswoman for Rossello did not return a message for comment. The 32BJ SEIU union, which represents property service workers, called the withholding of funds a “cruel and arrogant” decision. “It is unconscionable that FEMA and the Treasury Department are withholding the disaster aid funding approved three months ago for Puerto Rico,” it said. “Despite being unable to carry out many vital functions, Puerto Rico is deemed by these federal agencies as not poor enough to qualify for emergency loans.” On Wednesday, the federal control board announced it would hold a public hearing Friday into why nearly $7 billion is being held in local government accounts, where that money came from and how it will be used. Puerto Rico is seeking hurricane emergency loans as it struggles to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt and reach agreements with certain creditors more than two years after the government said it was unable to pay its debt obligations. A study released Tuesday by economists including Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz found in part that prior to the hurricane, Puerto Rico needed to cancel 50 percent to 80 percent of its debt to regain economic stability. “The debt restructuring will not be a sufficient but just a necessary condition for economic recovery,” the study stated. “Puerto Rico needs more than just the restoration of debt sustainability: it needs a new economic growth strategy that replaces the old one that has clearly failed.”",https://apnews.com/7f3def1760464941a4a1ffdff4ff6745/US-withholds-hurricane-emergency-loan-sought-by-Puerto-Rico,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico, FEMA still at odds on terms of government loan",Nick Brown,1/17/18,"A Puerto Rico official on Wednesday said the U.S. federal government was dragging its feet in letting the beleaguered U.S. territory draw on an emergency loan in the aftermath of September’s Hurricane Maria, threatening essential services. A house is lit up with the help of a generator next to houses in the dark after Hurricane Maria damaged the electrical grid in September, in Dorado, Puerto Rico January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin BaezGerardo Portela, director of Puerto Rico’s financial authority AAFAF, said in a statement that U.S. officials should hasten to complete ongoing talks with Puerto Rico’s government on the terms and conditions for access to billions of dollars in federal disaster relief. Public agencies in Puerto Rico, like power utility PREPA and sewer authority PRASA, “face severe liquidity problems that threaten essential services . . . if immediate action is not taken,” Portela said in the statement in Spanish. The comments highlight mounting tension between locals who feel Puerto Rico is not getting the attention it needs from federal authorities, and authorities concerned that the island may have more financial resources than it is letting on. Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst disaster in 90 years, hit the island on Sept. 20 last year, killing dozens and knocking out power to all of its 3. 4 million U.S. citizens. The storm occurred in the wake of the island government’s bankruptcy which left it facing $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt. In October, U.S. lawmakers approved a $4. 9 billion loan to hurricaneravaged governments in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas and Florida, money meant to help maintain basic services, but Puerto Rico has yet to see its share. Portela’s comments followed a January 9th letter from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which said Puerto Rico could not begin drawing on the loan because its cash balances are too high. FEMA’s letter noted Puerto Rico has about $1. 7 billion in liquidity, despite island leaders having forecast it to run out of cash by October 31, and that FEMA was negotiating with Puerto Rico on the timing and terms of the loan. “Funds will be provided . . . when the commonwealth’s central cash balance decreases to a certain level,” FEMA said. Meanwhile, a federallyappointed board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances announced Wednesday it would meet on Friday to discuss an ongoing probe into reports that Puerto Rico’s government has some $6. 9 billion in cash at hundreds of bank accounts. Such reports are fueling a perception among some authorities and financial stakeholders that Puerto Rico is overstating its economic plight. For many in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate hovers near 50 percent and public pensions are nearly insolvent, FEMA’s letter adds to a perception that the island is not getting fair treatment. The Service Employees International Union, which represents thousands of Puerto Rican workers, called FEMA’s reasoning “unconscionable,” saying in a statement on Wednesday that “Puerto Rican working families continue to be treated as secondclass citizens by [U.S. President Donald Trump’s] Administration and Congress. ”The US Virgin Islands, also a deeplyindebted U.S. territory, has begun drawing on its nearly $300 million share of the emergency loan, but has faced strict repayment terms not traditionally imposed on municipalities on the mainland, namely a requirement to pledge senior liens as collateral. Puerto Rico could face similar terms.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-storm-loan-idUSKBN1F705H,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor orders probe of discovery of hurricane recovery materials,Nick Brown,1/11/18,"Puerto Rico’s governor has ordered an investigation of materials discovered in a warehouse belonging to the U.S. territory’s electric authority that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said are critical to restoring power following September’s Hurricane Maria. FILE PHOTO:  Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, poses in New York City, U.S. , November 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoGovernor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement on Thursday he is ordering the island’s Department of Justice to investigate whether “rules were violated and/or crimes were committed against the public interest” in the procurement and administration of the materials. It is the latest headache for Puerto Rico over the response by its power authority, known as PREPA, to the September storm, which decimated the U.S. territory’s outdated electric grid so forcefully that 40 percent of its 3. 4 million residents remain without power. The Army Corps, which is in charge of grid repairs in Puerto Rico, on Saturday discovered a stock of transformers, splices and other materials in a warehouse at PREPA’s Palo Seco plant. The Army Corps said the materials were not being used, leading to some delays in power resurgence. PREPA refuted that, saying the items were consistently put to use, if not specifically for hurricane recovery. Carlos Monroig, a spokesman for PREPA, on Thursday said the materials were being used for “capital improvements. ” In a separate statement in Spanish, PREPA said the materials had been used to build transmission lines, pursuant to bond issues carried out by past administrations to acquire the materials. Army Corps spokeswoman Lynn Rose said the Corps began distributing the materials to its contractors on Saturday. The items are “critical to the ongoing mission to restore power to Puerto Rico,” Rose said, declining to comment on Rossello’s referral to the Justice Department. Puerto Rico is struggling to recover from Maria, its worst disaster in 90 years, while at the same time navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt. PREPA’s public image is still reeling from the revelation in the weeks after the storm that it had awarded a $300 million, nobid grid repair contract to the tiny Montana firm Whitefish Energy Holdings. That contract, later canceled by Rossello, led to a U.S. congressional investigation and the eventual resignation of exPREPA chief Ricardo Ramos. In bankruptcy with some $9 billion of debt, PREPA has long been plagued by a shrinking workforce and sorely outdated infrastructure.

Puerto Rico creditor Aurelius asks U.S. judge to throw out bankruptcy,Nick Brown,1/10/18,"Aurelius Capital Management, a major Puerto Rico bondholder, asked a federal judge on Wednesday to throw out the U.S. territory’s historic bankruptcy, challenging the constitutionality of the board overseeing the island’s finances. Attorney Donald B. Verrilli arrives for a hearing regarding Puerto Rico's bondholder Aurelius Capital Management at the the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in New York City, U.S. , January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidAt a hearing in federal court in New York, Aurelius told U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain that Puerto Rico’s oversight board was appointed by the U.S. Congress in violation of the Constitution’s appointments clause, which governs how certain public officials are designated. “Congress can go back and do this right,” Aurelius lawyer and former U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson said. “The president can make new appointments. ”The bankruptcy case filed by the board last May on Puerto Rico’s behalf should be thrown out, Olson added during a threeandahalf hour hearing. Swain, who is presiding over Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy case, did not indicate when she may rule, and her decision is certain to be appealed by whichever side loses. The case goes to the heart of how Puerto Rico is to restructure $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and who may oversee the process. A dismissal of the bankruptcy would add more uncertainty for an island already navigating the biggest restructuring in U.S. municipal history while struggling to recover from its worst natural disaster in 90 years, September’s Hurricane Maria. Under a 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, Congress appointed six members to a board tasked with managing the territory’s finances, with President Barack Obama adding a seventh. PROMESA gave the board authority to push Puerto Rico into a courtsupervised restructuring akin to U.S. bankruptcy, which it did in May. Since then, the board has pushed for drastic repayments cuts to bondholders like Aurelius, which holds around $468 million of Puerto Rico’s debt. Aurelius says board members are federal officers, and under the appointments clause should have been appointed by the U.S. president, and confirmed by the Senate. “The president had to choose appointees from lawmakers’ lists,” Olson said. “Congress cannot put the president in that kind of box. ”By no means an effort to free Puerto Rico from federal oversight, Aurelius wants the bankruptcy nixed and, possibly, the reappointment of new board members by incumbent Republican President Donald Trump. CLASH OF LEGAL TITANSIts case is viewed as a longshot, but the hedge fund, known for aggressive litigation, pulled out all the stops in tapping Olson. In addition to his role as solicitor general, Olson is famous for representing Bush in 2000’s Bush v. Gore U.S. Supreme Court case, as well as challenging California’s “Proposition 8” ban on samesex marriage. For its part, the board hired exObama Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued on Wednesday that the board is “funded 100 percent out of the treasury of Puerto Rico,” and that its members are officers of that island, not the United States. Verrilli warned that Aurelius’ argument could call into question the federal government’s 1947 decision allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own governor, potentially threatening Puerto Rico’s very right to selfrule. The U.S. Department of Justice sided with the board, calling PROMESA “unquestionably constitutional. ”“Despite all the former solicitor generals in the room today, we don’t feel this one is that close,” DOJ lawyer Thomas Ward said. The case is In re: Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 173283, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-idUSKBN1EZ2UR,Reuters,Neutral
"3+ months after Maria, barely half of Puerto Rico has power",DANICA COTO,12/30/17,"Puerto Rico authorities said Friday that nearly half of power customers in the U.S. territory still lack electricity more than three months after Hurricane Maria, sparking outrage among islanders who accuse the government of mismanaging its response to the Category 4 storm. Officials said 55 percent of the nearly 1.5 million customers have power, marking the first time the government has provided that statistic since Maria hit on Sept. 20 with winds of up to 154 mph. Officials had previously reported only power generation, which stands at nearly 70 percent of pre-storm levels. “It’s just extraordinary that it is still so far away from being 100 percent recovered,” said Susan Tierney, a senior adviser for Denver-based consulting company Analysis Group who testified before a U.S. Senate committee on efforts to restore power in Puerto Rico. “I’m not aware of any time in recent decades since the U.S. has electrified the entire economy that there has been an outage of this magnitude.” One of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities remains entirely without power, and it’s unclear when some electricity will be restored to the central mountain town of Ciales. Crews this week restored power for the first time to parts of the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa, which received the first hit from Maria. Among those still in the dark is Christian Pagan, 58, who lives near the capital of San Juan and said it was the government’s fault that a large number of people still don’t have power. “Everybody saw that the devastation was great, but I don’t understand why they’re trying to sell people something that’s not real,” he said of the explanations the government has provided as to why power has not been fully restored. “The first month was lost to bureaucracy and an uncoordinated reaction.” He especially criticized the power company’s former director, Ricardo Ramos, who resigned in late October after signing a $300 million contract for a Montana-based company that had only two full-time employees when the storm hit. Ramos also had said that he did not activate mutual-aid agreements with power companies in the U.S. mainland in part because there was no way to communicate with them. “That’s the kind of help you ask for three days before the hurricane,” Pagan said. It is not yet known what percentage of businesses and homes now have electricity. Power company spokesman Geraldo Quinones told The Associated Press that officials are still working to obtain that data, stressing that the optical fiber that helps provide the number of customers with power and other data was destroyed by the hurricane. Gov. Ricardo Rossello had pledged 95 percent power generation by Dec. 15, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said the entire island will have power by May. Fredyson Martinez, vice president of a union that represents workers with Puerto Rico’s power company, told the AP on Friday that a recent study by local engineers found that 90 percent of industries and 75 percent of businesses already have power, meaning residential areas are disproportionately in the dark. Martinez said the company should have provided the number of customers without power a while ago, adding that officials had other ways of obtaining the information despite the damaged fiber optic cable. Martinez also said that a lack of supplies and equipment is slowing power restoration efforts, echoing an early concern by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which also has said that Puerto Rico’s rough terrain presents another challenge. Government officials said nearly 14,000 poles already have been shipped to Puerto Rico, and that another 7,000 will arrive in upcoming days. In addition, some 3,500 workers are trying to restore power across the island, with many working through the holidays and others even stripping down to their shorts to swim across a cold river with a strong current to reach damaged infrastructure. “We know that the priority of our clients is to know when they will receive the power service again,” said Justo Gonzalez, the power company’s interim director. “Maria severely impacted most of our energy infrastructure.” Officials said Puerto Rico has 2,400 miles of transmission lines, 30,000 miles of distribution lines and 342 substations that suffered substantial damage during the hurricane. Gonzalez said crews are tackling projects that include installing new poles and building primary transmission towers and connection wiring. Carlos Torres, who is overseeing power restoration efforts, said that crews are still finding unexpected damage including what he called severely impacted substations. “We will not stop working until every person and business has their lights back on,” he said. Among those still waiting for power is Eileen Cheverez, a 48-year-old respiratory therapist who lives in Morovis, which borders Ciales. She said power was restored to homes around her, but that crews still need to set up a key cable so she can have lights. “This truly consumes you mentally, emotionally,” she said, adding that seeing homes lit up around her gives her some hope amid the frustration. “It’s like a lack of respect. I know the damage was great, especially in the mountains, but I feel they’ve taken too long.” Puerto Rico’s governor on Friday said that he has requested up to 1,500 additional workers from electric companies across the U.S. mainland to help restore power, and said he has asked the Army Corps of Engineers to increase its capacity to provide assistance. “We understand how difficult it has been for the people of Puerto Rico who have been without power for so long,” he said. “Our administration will continue working to ensure that there are the necessary resources to complete this restoration effort after an unprecedented devastation.”",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-72fbcd5efa784a59a834e3cb58d0d137,AP,Neutral
"Dark, desperate life without power in Puerto Rico",DANICA COTO,12/25/17,"Three days before Christmas, Doris Martinez and daughter Miriam Narvaez joined their neighbors in a line outside city hall in Morovis, a town of 30,000 people still living without electricity in the mountains of central Puerto Rico more than three months after Hurricane Maria battered the U.S. island. They waited two hours under the searing sun for their twice-a-week handout — 24 bottles of water and a cardboard box filled with basic foods such as tortillas, canned vegetables and cereal. Martinez, a 73-year-old cancer survivor, balanced the water atop the food and picked her way up a steep hill to the home where she lives alone, washing and wringing out her clothes by hand and locking herself in at night, afraid of robbers. Her 53-year-old daughter loaded her food and water into her car and drove off to the public housing complex where she would then have to wait with dozens of other neighbors in another line to cook on one of six gas burners in the administrator’s office. “Things are not good,” Narvaez said as she headed toward home. This is life in Puerto Rico more than three months after Maria destroyed the island’s electrical grid. Gov. Ricardo Rossello promised in mid-October to restore 95 percent of electricity delivery by Dec. 15, but normality remains far off. Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority says its system is generating at 70 percent of normal but it has no way of knowing how widely electricity is being distributed because the system that measures that isn’t working. A study conducted Dec. 11 by a group of local engineers estimated roughly 50 percent of the island’s 3.3 million people remained without power. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said it likely won’t be until May that all of Puerto Rico is electrified. Local and federal officials blame the rough terrain and extensive damage for delaying restoration of a power infrastructure that was in dire need of maintenance due to Puerto Rico’s 11-year-old recession. A growing number of Puerto Ricans say officials didn’t prepare for the hurricane and didn’t activate a mutual aid agreement with power companies on the U.S. mainland quickly enough. Government crews reconnected a handful of areas in Morovis over the weekend for the first time since the storm, but in the hundreds of neighborhoods and towns without power this holiday season, people are alternately despairing, furious, resigned, and sometimes in disbelief that the United States remains unable to help restore power to its citizens more than 90 days after a natural disaster. A little after noon, Arelis Navarro steps out of her nail salon to restart her car. The hood is open, and Navarro, 38 weeks pregnant, has connected an inverter to the battery and plugged in a cluster of extension cords, lights and a fan for her salon. “You have to make the effort because as you can imagine, I have debts to pay, a daughter to maintain and another one on the way,” she says as she taps some powder on a woman’s nails to prepare them for an acrylic artificial set. Down the hill, past the town’s plaza and up another hill, 50-year-old Maria Rivera watches her husband and two friends remove broken furniture and soggy sheets from their home, which was destroyed by the storm. It is 2 p.m., and the three men toss the debris into a truck one of them owns. City officials never showed up to clear the debris, and crews with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency did not come until this month to assess the damage. Tears moisten Rivera’s eyes as she gazes at what remains of the home where she lived for 19 years with her husband and three children. “I haven’t been able to assimilate everything that has happened,” she says, adding that she spends most of the day bracing for darkness. “When night falls, you start growing anxious, depressed. Everything has changed ... Sometimes I go to places that have power and I tell my husband, ‘I don’t want to go back.’” By 4 p.m., some generators in Rivera’s neighborhood start rumbling as darkness approaches on the shortest day of the year. A teenager bounces a basketball and takes a couple of shots on a court before heading home, while several men wrap up reconstruction efforts at a roofless home that federal crews fitted with a blue tarp just two weeks ago. Nearly 1,000 homes across Morovis lost their roofs and 90 percent of residents have not received federal assistance, Mayor Carmen Maldonado says. She expects it will be several more months before power returns to the entire town. Overall, more than 200,000 homes were damaged in Puerto Rico by the storm, whose destruction will cost an estimated $95 billion to repair. Darkness creeps across Morovis, and 56-year-old Jose Luis Gonzalez wipes sweat from his brow as he finishes helping rebuild a home in the Barrio Patron neighborhood, where people spent two months without water after Hurricane Maria hit with winds of up to 154 mph. They relied on a nearby creek for bathing and washing clothes. Men visited the creek at 5:30 p.m. every day and women took their place a half hour later. One person was designated to guard the entrance as people disrobed. Water service finally returned in November. “Don’t think I haven’t felt like crying,” Gonzalez says, adding that he has flashbacks to the day of the storm. “Every time I close my eyes I see chaos ... I still hear the screams in my head.” Every night he takes six pills for depression and back pain. He says a relative who lived across from him took his own life three weeks after the hurricane. No note was left, but government officials say they are counting some suicides as part of the official death toll because people across the island have become so desperate amid the destruction left by the storm. The governor also recently ordered a review of all deaths reported since Maria amid accusations that the official death toll of 64 undercounts the true toll. At 6 p.m. it is nearly dark in Barrio Patron. The mother of the man who killed himself appears on a darkened balcony surrounded by tiny, solar-powered Christmas lights and a Puerto Rico flag fluttering lightly in the breeze. Neighbors around her strike matches and start lighting candles that they place in bedrooms and bathrooms, a warm if flickering glow filling their homes. Those with generators walk over to extension cords where multiple cellphones are plugged and check on the batteries’ status. Not that they use them often; cellphone service in Morovis remains spotty. Nearby, 29-year-old Wilmary Gonzalez ushers her three young children into their darkened home. The light blue glow cast by a tarp donated by a church to cover half their roof has already dissipated. The other half of the roof is slabs of recycled zinc that Jose Luis Gonzalez pieced together for the family, along with broken pieces of wood to create makeshift rafters with jagged edges that jut out at random angles. FEMA has not given them any assistance. “You always have to have a smile on your face because if not, the kids get sad,” Wilmary Gonzalez says, tears welling in her eyes. She waits with her kids and a tiny lantern for her husband, Carlos Oliveras, to close his barber shop and return to a home with only a table, four chairs and a couple of mattresses. The rest was lost in the storm. Around 8 p.m., a pair of headlights cuts through the darkness and her husband steps out of the car. He connects an inverter to his car battery and hoists his youngest daughter, 2-year-old Yeinelis, so she can push the button that activates an LED strip donated to the family that Oliveras has secured to the front door. It casts a harsh fluorescent light over the family’s nearly empty kitchen and living room. Oliveras heats himself some rice and beans that his wife takes out from a small and heavily scuffed red-and-white cooler where water and eggs are tucked next to a bag of ice. “My new fridge,” she says. Neighbors in Barrio Patron and other parts of Morovis start blowing out candles and turning off generators as they go to bed around 9 p.m., having nothing else to do in the dark.

Trump Cabinet officials to visit Puerto Rico to assess recovery,Roberta Rampton,12/18/17,"Two members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet are set to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to assess the U.S. territory’s rebuilding in the three months since Hurricane Maria devastated homes, businesses and the power grid. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson will travel to Puerto Rico, where about a third of the island’s 3. 4 million residents are still without power, hundreds remain in shelters, and thousands have fled to the U.S. mainland. The visit comes as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday were planning to unveil a disaster aid package totaling $81 billion, according to a senior congressional aide. Some of that aid would go to Puerto Rico, but also to states like Texas and Florida that were hit by other hurricanes and to California, which is grappling with wild fires. Even before Maria savaged Puerto Rico, the island was contending with $72 billion in debt. Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked the federal government for a total of $94. 4 billion in aid, including $31. 1 billion for housing and $17. 8 billion to rebuild its ruined power grid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has so far approved more than $660 million in aid for individuals in Puerto Rico as well as more than $450 million in public assistance. Nielsen and Carson will receive detailed briefings on rebuilding efforts and see how federal aid is helping residents to recover, a DHS official said. Nielsen, who oversees FEMA, and Rossello are slated to hold a news conference. The visit comes as Congress prepares to vote on a tax overhaul bill that Puerto Rican officials have said they fear will hurt the commonwealth’s pharmaceutical manufacturing sector ,the cornerstone of the island’s economy ,at a time when Puerto Rico can least afford to lose jobs and tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s government has said 64 people died because of the hurricane, but after multiple media estimates of dramatically higher figures, Rossello on Monday ordered an official review of the death toll.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico/trump-cabinet-officials-to-visit-puerto-rico-to-assess-recovery-idUSKBN1ED026,Reuters,Neutral
"AP EXCLUSIVE: Big contracts, no storm tarps for Puerto Rico",TAMI ABDOLLAH and MICHAEL BIESECKER,11/28/17,"After Hurricane Maria damaged tens of thousands of homes in Puerto Rico, a newly created Florida company with an unproven record won more than $30 million in contracts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide emergency tarps and plastic sheeting for repairs. Bronze Star LLC never delivered those urgently needed supplies, which even months later remain in demand by hurricane victims on the island. FEMA eventually terminated the contracts, without paying any money, and re-started the process this month to supply more tarps for the island. The earlier effort took nearly four weeks from the day FEMA awarded the contracts to Bronze Star and the day it canceled them. Thousands of Puerto Ricans remain homeless, and many complain that the federal government is taking too long to install tarps. The U.S. territory has been hit by severe rainstorms in recent weeks that have caused widespread flooding. It is not clear how thoroughly FEMA investigated Bronze Star or its ability to fulfill the contracts. Formed by two brothers in August, Bronze Star had never before won a government contract or delivered tarps or plastic sheeting. The address listed for the business is a single-family home in a residential subdivision in St. Cloud, Florida. One of the brothers, Kayon Jones, said manufacturers he contacted before bidding on the contracts assured him they could provide the tarps but later said they could not meet the government’s requirements. Jones said supplying the materials was problematic because most of the raw materials came out of Houston, which was hit hard by Hurricane Harvey. He said he sought a waiver from FEMA to allow him to order tarps from a Chinese manufacturer and for more time, but FEMA denied the request. FEMA canceled the contracts Nov. 6, Jones said. The government notified his brother and him a few days later that it would seek $9.3 million in damages unless they signed a waiver releasing the U.S. from any liability. The brothers agreed. “We were trying to help; it wasn’t about making money or anything like that,” Jones said. FEMA awarded the company two contracts Oct. 10 to provide 500,000 tarps and 60,000 rolls of plastic sheeting. More than a half dozen others also bid, but FEMA said it could not provide details about their bids. “The award of a government contract to a company with absolutely no experience in producing the materials sought obviously raises very bright red flags,” said Dan Feldman, professor of public management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York. “I would hope and assume that the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security would begin immediately to take a very hard look at this process.” A FEMA spokesman, Ron Roth, said the agency’s review process was “somewhat expedited” after Hurricane Maria to respond as quickly as possible to the emergency. But he said the agency did perform its due diligence. “Submissions from potential contractors are objectively evaluated, and a contract is awarded based on the highest-rated submission,” Roth said. Such “best value” competitive solicitations take into account past performance and a contractor’s ability to deliver as well as price, said Alan Miller, an attorney who spent 22-years advising federal contracting officials until retiring last year. “In every circumstance, regardless of the award, whether it’s $400 to the local stationery company for envelopes, or it’s $400 million for a construction contract, the contracting officer is required to make a responsibility determination,” Miller said. “Does this company have the infrastructure; do they have the inventory processes, the production processes, the financial capability, for performing the work?” Nine bids were received on the first contract for plastic sheeting and eight bids on the second contract for tarps. Roth said Star was determined to be the most qualified. “FEMA’s initial technical evaluation determined Bronze Star could do the jobs based on their proposals, which confirmed that they could meet the product specifications and delivery dates,” he said. Kayon Jones, the co-owner of Bronze Star, served in the U.S. Navy from 1997 to 2000, finishing his duty as a seaman storekeeper on the USS Gettysburg, a guided missile cruiser. The contract solicitation gave preference to veteran-owned companies. According to Navy records, Jones was never awarded a Bronze Star, a medal earned by service members who serve heroically in combat. In an interview, Jones told The Associated Press he picked the name because he has another company with the word star in it. He said his brother, who is also listed on state incorporation documents for the business, served in the Army and is disabled. Army records show Jones’ brother also didn’t receive a Bronze Star, and it provided no evidence of a service-related injury. Richard Jones did not respond to multiple calls and requests through his brother for comment. “My brother and I, we are both veterans, so we just came up with a name to do business,” Kayon Jones said. “We’re not saying we have a Bronze Star or anything.” The day after FEMA canceled the Bronze Star contract, it awarded a contract to OSC Solutions Inc. for plastic sheeting for Hurricane Maria victims. The West Palm Beach, Florida-based company has roughly two decades of federal contracting experience and has produced such supplies multiple times. The FEMA spokesman, Roth, acknowledged the contract problems delayed delivery of tarps to Puerto Rico but said anyone who needs a tarp should now be able to get one. More than 93,000 tarps have been sent to distribution centers on the island and now are available to cover homes, Roth said. The Army Corps of Engineers’ “Blue Roof” program has provided 11,000 more reinforced tarps installed on homes by contractors. To date, roughly $88 million in federal money has been awarded to four contractors, including Bronze Star, for tents and tarps, records show. The rescinded contracts with Bronze Star account for 35 percent of the total. Michael Byrne, Puerto Rico’s FEMA coordination officer, estimated that at least 60,000 blue roofs are needed across the island. About 350 are installed each day, though he said that is expected to increase. “One of the limiting factors is the availability of the material,” Byrne said. ___ AP writer Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.

"Bill Clinton visits Puerto Rico, distributes relief supplies",No Author,11/21/17,"Former U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Puerto Rico on Monday and met with those left homeless after Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory as a Category 4 storm. Clinton arrived with medical supplies and solar energy equipment donated by the Clinton Foundation, which has already shipped 76 tons of medicine and medical equipment since the storm hit on Sept. 20. Clinton also visited health clinics and the island’s largest shelter with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello. He planned to meet with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and other officials later Monday. Rossello said Clinton’s visit will help people realize that Puerto Rico still needs relief supplies more than two months after the hurricane hit. “It’s important to have him here because he has a vision of how to emerge from the emergency phase, establish normalcy and begin to rebuild,” Rossello said. The hurricane killed at least 55 people and caused up to an estimated $95 billion in damage. More than 20 of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities are still without power, and more than 140,000 people have fled for the U.S. mainland.","https://apnews.com/add2d5ffd7b2433582dacb3bb3b82d4c/Bill-Clinton-visits-Puerto-Rico,-distributes-relief-supplies",AP,Neutral
Experts: Puerto Rico may struggle for more than a decade,DANICA COTO,11/17/17,"Puerto Rico could face more than a decade of further economic stagnation and a steep drop in population as a result of Hurricane Maria, experts said on Thursday. The stark estimates were presented to members of a federal control board overseeing finances of a U.S. territory that is already in the 11th year of a recession. “The situation is dire to say the least with destroyed infrastructure, lack of power and water and an accelerated pace of migration,” economist Heidie Calero said. She estimated that the hurricane caused $115 billion in damage, even without counting business losses. “We believe that is very conservative,” she said. The administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello said earlier this week that it was seeking $94 billion in federal aid for an island where power generation remains at 40 percent and where nearly 10 percent of people are still without water almost two months after the storm. More than 20 of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities remain completely without power. So far, U.S. Congress has approved nearly $5 billion in aid for Puerto Rico. Economist Juan Lara told board members that the local economy could contract anywhere between 8 percent and 15 percent in fiscal year 2018, depending on the restoration of power, with overall revenues falling by 30 percent. “We are undergoing both a demand and supply shock,” he said, saying that some 5,000 businesses could close permanently, representing 10 percent of membership of the island’s National Retail Federation. Businesses that have reopened have been forced to reduce their hours or depend on costly generators. “We need electric power to be back and to be reliable,” Lara said. “We need roads to be cleared. We need supermarkets to be able to replenish their inventories.... We need to restore basic operating infrastructure.” Lack of power remains the biggest obstacle, with the island’s electric company struggling to maintain the 50 percent power generation it had reached on Wednesday just as a major blackout occurred for the second time in a week. Rossello has said the company would reach 80 percent generation by end of November and 95 percent by mid-December, goals that many have called ambitious. In contrast, the U.S. Corps of Engineers has said it expects 75 percent generation by end of January. Before Hurricane Maria hit, Puerto Rico was trying to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt load amid a deep economic crisis that has prompted an exodus of nearly half a million people in the past decade. That migration will only accelerate because of post-hurricane conditions, with an estimated population of 2.8 million people by 2030, compared with the current 3.4 million, said economist Jose Villamil. “What Maria has done in some ways is to exacerbate that situation, made it more intense,” he said. The drop in population, coupled with a majority of young, talented people leaving, will hit Puerto Rico’s economy even harder, experts said. Two more meetings remain as the board continues to gather information to revise a fiscal plan to adjust for the hurricane’s impact. It is unclear how much money, if any, will be set aside in the plan to pay off the island’s debt load.",https://apnews.com/701b0e650089478497a45c1a3cd61cf7/Experts:-Puerto-Rico-may-struggle-for-more-than-a-decade,AP,Neutral
U.S. Congress to seek new tax incentives for Puerto Rico rebuilding,Reuters Staff,11/16/17,"U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he wants to craft changes to a justpassed tax overhaul bill to provide “additional tax incentives” that would help Puerto Ricans recover from Hurricane Maria. In a statement following passage in the House of a major tax bill, Ryan said he would try to insert unspecified provisions into the legislation that would grant new tax incentives “so that our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico can have all the possible resources to rebuild their lives and their economy. ”Puerto Rico has been reeling from hurricane damage, which disrupted the U.S. territory’s power grid, contaminated water supplies and destroyed homes and businesses.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-taxes-idUSKBN1DG32F,Reuters,Neutral
Avenue's Lasry sees no Puerto Rico debt payments for 2-3 years,Daniel Bases,11/15/17,"Marc Lasry, billionaire owner of Avenue Capital Management, said on Wednesday he does not expect Puerto Rico, struggling with the devastation caused by two hurricanes and bankruptcy, to make debt payments for at least the next two to three years. Marc Lasry, CEO and CoFounder of Avenue Capital Group, speaks during the  Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York, U.S. , November 15, 2017. REUTERS/Mike SegarKnown for his distressed asset investment strategy, Lasry said he should not be but still is invested in Puerto Rican debt. “We lost money in it,” Lasry said at the  Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit. “We sold a bunch, so it is not that big (of a position), probably $50 million in market value, so probably $150 million to $200 million in face (value),” Lasry said. Hurricane Maria made landfall in September, knocking out power to the entire island and compounding a financial crisis in the U.S. commonwealth, which has declared bankruptcy with a combination of $120 billion in unpayable debt and pension liabilities.    Under the 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, Puerto Rico and its agencies, including utility PREPA, filed for bankruptcy under special rules known as Title III. Those proceedings are being overseen by the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, also created under PROMESA. Lasry said the majority of the investment is in the debt issued by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), followed by general government obligation debt and other credits. “It has become a much longer hold,” he said, but was not sure he would come out whole in the end. “That’s why we are holding it. That’s the analysis we have made, but it is just getting more and more complicated,” he said. Indeed, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94. 4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island, which is still struggling to restore full power supplies. On Wednesday a technical problem knocked out electricity to parts of capital San Juan and other areas. Two Democrat lawmakers urged in a letter on Wednesday to the Oversight Board that it should request the U.S. court overseeing the debt restructuring to completely write off the island’s debt obligations. Both U.S. Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote that Puerto Rico should be addressing its humanitarian crisis and rebuilding rather than paying creditors. “Irrespective of Congress’s response, creditors must now finally face the reality that Puerto Rico will never be able to repay its preexisting debt, and the Oversight Board must act in accordance with that reality too,” the lawmakers wrote to the board chairman, Jose Carrion. The Oversight Board’s lead lawyer was cited in a Bloomberg News article suggesting in a Manhattan court that the island was considering suspending debtservice payments for five years. However, in response to a  query about the debt service, board spokesman Francisco Cimadevilla said in a statement: “The Oversight Board is in the initial stages of developing a fiveyear fiscal plan and has no specific numbers at this time. That said, the devastating effect of the hurricane on the economy and already dire financial situation is substantial. ”Under its Title III bankruptcy filings, Puerto Rico already has stopped making payments on its debt. Puerto Rico's benchmark 2035 General Obligation debt, which trades like an equity given it is in default, fell to an alltime low on Wednesday of 24 cents on the dollar. The bond was issued in 2014 with an 8 percent coupon. 74514LE86=MSRBFor other stories from  Global Investment Outlook Summit, see: here(Reporting by Daniel Bases)                            Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-debt-lasry-idUSKBN1DF2YA,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. judge denies request for outsider to oversee Puerto Rico's PREPA,Daniel Bases,11/13/17,"A U.S. federal judge on Monday rejected a request to install a former military officer to oversee Puerto Rico’s beleaguered electric utility, PREPA, a victory for Governor Ricardo Rossello, whose government opposed the appointment. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, poses in New York City, U.S. , November 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidU.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, ruling from the bench in New York, denied a motion filed Oct. 26 by the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, according to a court official. The board wanted to install retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Noel Zamot as PREPA’s chief transformation officer. The oversight board was created under the 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, which is charged with helping the island recover from a financial disaster that left it with $120 billion in unpayable debt and pension liabilities. Zamot’s name was put forward as an emergency manager after PREPA was criticized for signing a $300 million, nobid contract with tiny Whitefish Energy Holdings to lead power restoration efforts. The deal sparked an uproar over its provisions and the Montana company’s lack of experience with projects that big. PREPA on Oct. 29 agreed to cancel the contract after Rossello urged that it be scrapped. In its motion, the board sought the court’s approval “confirming Noel Zamot as PREPA’s Chief Transformation Officer (the “CTO”) with all the powers of a chief executive officer reporting to the Oversight Board. ”However, Puerto Rico’s government believed the move was an overreach of the oversight board’s authority and forcefully opposed the move in a public meeting on Oct. 31. The government’s liaison to the board, Christian Sobrino, said the appointment would essentially mean the board could replace any Puerto Rican government official, “maybe even the governor. ”Late on Monday and well after the judge’s ruling, Chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Rob Bishop, a Republican from Utah lashed out at PREPA ahead of a hearing on Tuesday where Rossello will offer testimony. “A legacy of dysfunction (at PREPA) has created a competence deficit that threatens the island’s ability to improve conditions for its citizens. Confidence in the utility’s ability to manage contracts and time sensitive disaster related infrastructure work is long gone,” Bishop said. His committee drafted the rescue law known as PROMESA. Earlier on Monday, Rossello released a letter sent to President Donald Trump saying Puerto Rico’s government was requesting $94. 4 billion from Congress to rebuild island infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. Rossello made a show of stating that Puerto Rico’s rebuilding process would be the most transparent in history. However, Bruce Westerman, the chairman of the subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations from Arkansas, who also issued a statement through Bishop’s office saying: “It is obvious PREPA did not know how to draft a FEMAcompliant contract, nor did PREPA officials adhere to the advice of their own counsel on how to comply. I believe this is precisely why the oversight board should be granted more authority. While we understand the sense of urgency for the people of Puerto Rico, oversight and transparency are vital to this recovery process. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-prepa-idUKKBN1DD2MR,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico requests $94.4 billion from U.S. Congress for rebuilding,Daniel Bases,11/13/17,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94. 4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island’s infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria. Slideshow ( 2 images )“This is a conservative estimate based on similar efforts that have been done in New York, New Jersey and of course in Texas most recently,” Rossello said at a press conference streamed online from the National Governors Association in Washington. “Now, I am however confident that we have turned a corner. That we are now flowing out of the life sustainment phase and we are starting the recovery phase, and the rebuilding phase,” Rossello said. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Rossello said recovery from the storm, the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. commonwealth in 90 years, exceeded the resources of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund and associated programs. At the top of priorities is $31. 1 billion for housing, followed by $17. 8 billion to rebuild and make more resilient the power grid. Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner to the U.S. Congress Jenniffer GonzálezColón accompanied Rossello and said she introduced legislation to reform the disaster relief law known as the Stafford Act. The reform would allow disaster recovery money to be used to modernize infrastructure, not just return it to recent condition. Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was already weak. Restoring the power grid has been a top priority since Maria’s 150 mile per hour winds knocked it out completely on Sept. 20. Rossello and the island’s power authority, PREPA, were criticized for a nobid contract with a tiny private firm, Whitefish Energy, for a portion of the repairs. Rossello canceled the contract on Oct. 29 after an uproar over its provisions. On Monday, a U.S. federal judge rejected a request by the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico to install a former military officer to oversee PREPA, a victory for Rossello, whose government opposed the appointment. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest readings indicate 47. 8 percent of power capacity has been restored. Puerto Rico’s economy was already in recession before Maria landed and its government filed for bankruptcy in the face of $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities.

"In Puerto Rico, a sinkhole of rebuilding struggles",Laila Kearney,11/10/17,"Along a stretch of highway in suburban Bayamon, Puerto Rico, construction workers tried desperately to make progress repairing a 100footlong sinkhole before the clouds rolled in. Residents affected by Hurricane Maria wait in line to receive unemployment checks outside a government unemployment office along Puerto Rico Highway 2, outside San Juan, Puerto Rico, October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonPrevious rains had suspended work, as workers watched earth fall back into the hole. “It has not wanted to stop raining” since Hurricane Maria, said Carlos Rivera, a 26yearold contract worker at the site last month. Cars backed up for miles along Puerto Rico Highway 2 on either side of the colossal construction site, which swallowed four of five lanes. The 20foot crater was among thousands of sites damaged by a storm that exposed an already fragile infrastructure in Puerto Rico, decimating water, power and roadways all at once. Fixing just this one sinkhole required maneuvering a set of vexing logistical and financial hurdles that reveal why rebuilding this isolated island will take so much more time and work than in any stormravaged region of the mainland United States. The hole is only one of 3,500 reported incidents of hurricane damage to Puerto Ricoowned roadways, with repair costs estimated at $250 million. A U.S. territory, Puerto Rico was already in trouble when Maria hit on Sept. 20 as the strongest storm to strike the island in nine decades. Its economy had been in recession for a decade, pushing the island into bankruptcy to restructure about $120 billion in bond and pension debt. The task of rebuilding is made that much harder by the challenges and expense of bringing supplies and equipment to an island, which will depend heavily on U.S. aid and likely struggle to finance its expected share of the rebuilding. The storm cut all power and cell service, felled trees, destroyed 230,000 homes and damaged another 400,000. One of the casualties was this stretch of Highway 2, the vital 143mile artery between San Juan and Ponce. Running west from San Juan before looping south, the road transports thousands of people a day between the San Juan suburbs and the island’s bustling capital. Hurricane Maria’s rains flooded the pipes under Highway 2 until one burst. Water gushed out of the old pipe deep below the roadway, scouring out a hole into which the ground eventually collapsed. Officials could not ignore the sinkhole, which squeezed eastbound traffic into a single westbound lane and detoured westbound traffic. Tempers began to fray as residents endured a onemile drive for nearly an hour. NO POWER, NO PHONES, NO TRUCKSThe problem fell to Puerto Rico Transportation and Public Works Secretary Carlos Contreras Aponte. His department oversees the island’s Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA), which manages a third of Puerto Rico’s 9,300 miles of roadway. The most pressing problem facing Contreras was logistics: how to rebuild a road with no power, limited trucks, no electrical light, and no cell phones. As of this week, less than half the island’s power had been restored, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Puerto Rico’s antiquated electric grid was decimated by the storm and now needs a complete rebuild. Electricity is required to run the machinery used for extracting rock and other raw materials to produce asphalt. Since the storm, contractors have had to bring in dieselpowered generators to power the machinery, a cumbersome and expensive task, Contreras said. “That’s something that’s happening in every industry here,” creating a shortage of generators, Contreras said. Slideshow ( 8 images )Another scarce commodity: trucks. With much of the population cut off from power and communication, the island was forced to divert hundreds of trucks and drivers to help bring supplies to needy citizens. That left few vehicles behind to transport the equipment and materials needed to fix infrastructure, including Highway 2’s sinkhole. “The truck drivers, many have been hired by other companies,” the secretary said. Among those competing for trucks: Puerto Rico’s own water and sewer authority, known as PRASA. PRASA president Eli DiazAtienza told  in an interview in October that his agency had just 125 trucks to service the island’s 3. 4 million residents. He has requested trucks from FEMA, tapped the U.S. Army National Guard for vehicles, and contracted with private sector firms to repurpose vehicles such as milk trucks. “We’ll never have enough trucks,” Diaz said. Replacements for damaged traffic signals at all of Puerto Rico’s 1,200 intersections must be flown to the island from the states, a more expensive and complicated process than trucking them. “We don’t have those supplies here in Puerto Rico because we never had to repair the equipment at all of the intersections at once,” Contreras said. Through it all, communications remain a problem. With cellservice iffy, the roads department has resorted to using runners who travel hours to areas of the island without phone service to relay reports of damage. The travel time and wordofmouth communication has led to incorrect, incomplete or confusing information and further delays, Contreras said. “Sometimes we get a description of a problem, and then when we send the technical people, it’s a completely different story,” he explained. FINANCIAL RUINOne problem this particular sinkhole managed to avoid was money. Because it lay on a major thoroughfare, Contreras decided to prioritize it, funding repairs with an expected $1 million of the $42. 5 million in emergency funds from the Federal Highway Administration. Puerto Rico officials could not be reached for comment on the final costs and time required to repair the roadway. But a  witness who drove down Highway 2 this week said the area had been paved over and traffic was moving easily. The triage process that pits some rebuilding projects over others reflects the broader financial ruin in Puerto Rico. Initial U.S. aid packages won’t be nearly enough, so agencies like PRHTA ,and cities and towns, too ,will rely heavily on the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to finance rebuilding over the long term. “No municipality in Puerto Rico has the money to build the infrastructure that’s needed,” said Angel Perez, mayor of Guaynabo, where damage to municipal property is estimated at $25 million to $30 million ,a big hit for a San Juan suburb whose total budget is about $130 million. Cashstrapped cities and towns here are also scrambling to pay up front costs of rebuilding projects. In a major emergency, Puerto Rico is treated the same as a U.S. state, a FEMA spokesman said. It is eligible for the same FEMA aid and other types of federal funds made available when a state suffers a catastrophe, he said. Rebuilding aid is typically conditioned on a costsharing agreement that would require Puerto Rico to match a quarter of expenses. That share was reduced to 10 percent this month, the White House said. Still, Puerto Rico’s financial crisis and the crippling blow of the storm mean the territory could still be hardpressed to put up its share. The longer projects take, the more costly they get, Contreras said, as relentless Caribbean rain continues to erode damaged stretches of highway, particularly those buried by mudslides. At the Highway 2 sinkhole, construction worker Silvano Monica, 62, said the work was just a small start: “There are roads and bridges with problems like this all over the island. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puerto-rico-rebuild-insight-idUSKBN1DA1IM,Reuters,Neutral
Hurricane sets off fierce debate about leaving Puerto Rico,DANICA COTO,11/9/17,"The disaster wrought by Hurricane Maria has set off an anguished debate across Puerto Rico, where friends, family and co-workers are arguing fiercely over the morality of leaving the blacked-out island for the U.S. mainland versus fulfilling a patriotic duty to rebuild. More than 140,000 Puerto Ricans have left since the storm hit Sept. 20 and some experts estimate more than 300,000 more could leave in the next two years. That’s on top of a similar-size exodus over the last decade of economic crisis, creating a massive population loss for the U.S. territory of 3.4 million. Most of those who have left went on their own. Aid groups and the U.S. government helped evacuate large numbers of the elderly and sick. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has offered to help relocate those still in temporary shelters, about 2,400 people as of Friday, to temporary housing on the mainland. Many of those leaving are facing recriminations from fellow Puerto Ricans who accuse them of abandoning their homeland when it needs them the most. Nilsa Montes, an unemployed waitress, said her friends and family often talk negatively about those who have left. “They always get criticized because people point out, ‘Hey, you didn’t stay,’” she said. “I wouldn’t move because I don’t give up.” The drive to stay in Puerto Rico and help rebuild has become a sociocultural movement with its own slogan echoing Montes: “Yo no me quito,” or “I’m not giving up.” Those four words have become a popular hashtag posted next to pictures on social media of Puerto Ricans rebuilding homes, distributing food and water or simply relaxing on the beach. Some who left or are leaving respond with messages that they would stay if someone found them a job, power or water. The “yo no me quito” message carries so much meaning that when Denise Centeno, who runs the Hispanic Family Counseling center in Orlando, Florida, recently played “The Blessed Island” by a singer who included those four words in its lyrics, she provoked an unexpected reaction from clients. “People who had come from Puerto Rico were crying with a horrible feeling of guilt,” she recalled. “They feel like, ‘Wow, I gave up. I wanted to stay.’... Of course they feel hurt.” In a recent chain of comments on Twitter about the merits of staying against going, one Puerto Rican wrote: “Those of you who left are fleeing from catastrophe while those of us who stay will lift the flag even higher than it already is.” People who have left bridle at the criticism. Carlos Rodriguez, an unemployed security guard and volunteer paramedic, moved with his wife and two young girls to the U.S. mainland on Nov. 2 from their hometown of Cayey, nestled in Puerto Rico’s once-lush central mountains. The family lost its home and car to the storm and is now sleeping on the couch of a relative in Providence, Rhode Island, while looking for permanent housing and a job for Rodriguez. His parents, however, stayed in Puerto Rico. “You have no idea how much I would like to be able to help my family,” Rodriguez said by phone from Providence. “I’m here trying to do that.” Maria downed trees, homes and power lines in a 12-hour rampage with winds of up to 154 mph (247 kph). Much of Puerto Rico remains without power and 15 percent has no running water more than a month after the hurricane. It is the longest blackout in U.S. history, and officials have said the overall hurricane damage could range from $45 billion to $95 billion on an island already mired in an 11-year-long recession. The post-hurricane exodus will have its own economic impact, said economist Joaquin Villamil, chairman and CEO of Estudios Tecnicos, an economic consulting firm. “It is having a terrible effect,” he said, noting that retail sales are already down, and that the shrinking population will lead to a drop in tax collections and affect multiple sectors including housing. “Not only are you going to have an older population, but it will be poorer.” Professionals are leaving at alarming rates, and the island could see an overall 25 percent drop in population from 2000 to 2025, with 3 million people or less expected to remain by that year, down from 3.8 million nearly two decades ago, Villamil said. “It’s a very serious problem,” he said. “The demographic transition is the driver of what happens here economically and socially.” The debate about staying or going is rooted in Puerto Rico’s status as a U.S. territory. While their island isn’t a state, Puerto Ricans can seamlessly move elsewhere in the U.S., but many feel an identification with the island that is akin to national pride. “We need to stay here and help each other. Why are they running away from this problem?” said Sharon Velazquez, a homemaker who lives with her family in the western municipality of San Lorenzo, one of the hardest hit by Hurricane Maria. “We are not giving up ... We have to keep fighting.” The fight isn’t new in Puerto Rico. About a half million people have left in the past decade as a result of the long economic crisis, according to a report by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York. “For some years now, there has been some resentment,” said Luis Martinez-Fernandez, a history professor at University of Central Florida who focuses on Puerto Rico culture. “Those who were adamant about staying and making that point, they have dug deeper in their position.” Of the more than 140,000 islanders estimated to have left since the storm, more than 130,000 went to Florida alone, followed by Pennsylvania, Texas, New York and New Jersey, researchers at Hunter College said. Among them are an estimated 14,000 public school students, Education Secretary Julia Keleher said. Ivone Nieves, a teacher, spent three days working in water up to her ankles after Maria, then decided to move to Orlando. She arrived Nov. 1, and her partner and four children are scheduled to arrive Dec. 4. The family was left without water or power, and Nieves said she wants a better future for her children. She said she already has two job offers. “We can help lift up the island from anywhere in the United States,” she said. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Bissecker contributed from Washington.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-hurricanes-ea66f2fdc1a541e3980dce168e8be9c3,AP,Neutral
"Puerto Rico board, governor take power struggle to Congress",Richard Cowan,11/7/17,"The federally appointed oversight board that manages Puerto Rico’s finances asked Congress on Tuesday for backing in its fight with the island’s governor over who should take charge of limping efforts to restore electric power after Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello speaks during an interview in New York City, U.S. , November 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe board suggested that Congress make billions in federal aid expected to flow to Puerto Rico contingent on allowing it to name a new management team for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the island’s bankrupt utility. The idea, presented to lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee during a hearing, was quickly rebuked by a top aide to Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, who said the board had overstepped its authority. Power shortages affecting hospitals, schools and businesses have prompted as many as 100,000 Puerto Ricans to flee for the mainland ,a level of migration that could further hobble the local economy. As of Monday ,more than six weeks after the storm hit ,42 percent of the bankrupt island’s electricity had been restored. Last month, the oversight board moved to appoint retired Air Force Colonel Noel Zamot to run PREPA, a move being fought in court by Rossello and bondholders. Given the urgency of restoring electric power, Natalie Jaresko, the board’s executive director, asked lawmakers to clarify that the board has the authority to appoint Zamot, and suggested that federal aid be made contingent on it. Jaresko said the price tag for rebuilding the stormbattered island ,home to 3. 4 million Americans ,was as high as $100 billion. Congress is expected to weigh another request for tens of billions in disaster aid for Puerto Rico and other hurricanehit regions before the end of the year. “We would appreciate a legislative affirmation of those [authorities], and/or conditioning of appropriations on those powers as you see fit,” Jaresko told lawmakers. She also said federal loans provided to the cashstrapped island government to help it with payroll should include a “formalized mechanism” linking the liquidity relief to a new fiscal plan being developed by the board. Christian Sobrino, a top aide to Rossello, said in an interview after the hearing that it was “beyond the pale” for Jaresko to ask for more power in the midst of an emergency. “If a similar action or similar words were drawn in the case of Florida or Texas or Louisiana or any other state, there would be outrage,” Sobrino said, naming states that have recently experienced natural disasters. Rossello is set to appear before the same panel on Nov. 14. Committee Chairman Rob Bishop told reporters that he would not yet sketch out the steps Congress might take. “I want to do that which I can do quickly and effectively so I can give them the clarification so they can go forward,” he said. WHITEFISH CONTRACTLawmakers had planned to grill Ricardo Ramos, PREPA’s executive director, at the hearing. But on Monday night, the utility said he was too busy to attend. The House committee has asked PREPA to explain the circumstances surrounding the awarding of a $300 million contract to Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana company that had been hired to rebuild the island’s power grid. The contract has since been terminated. While PREPA officials were not present, lawmakers nonetheless lashed out against the utility, with some calling for ending its monopoly on the island. Calling it “a vehicle for political patronage for decades,” Democratic Representative Darren Soto said: “It has exhibited gross incompetence by overseeing a declining grid, approved a nobid insider Whitefish contract and it’s been mired in debt. PREPA is failing the Puerto Rican people. ”Soto, who represents a central Florida district with a large Puerto Rican population, called on Puerto Rican authorities to work with the oversight board “to break up PREPA’s failing monopoly” and establish regional entities to provide electricity. Jaresko weighed in, prompted by Soto, saying, “a stateowned monopoly does not work. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-power-idUSKBN1D72NQ,Reuters,Neutral
Beverly Ramos trained in Puerto Rico ahead of NYC Marathon,MELISSA MURPHY,11/5/17,"Beverly Ramos wore a headband with the colors of the Puerto Rican flag and soaked in the cheers along the route of the New York City Marathon. The two-time Olympian stayed in Puerto Rico to train despite two devastating hurricanes within a month. Her home of Trujillo Alto, near San Juan, was without electricity and running water after Hurricane Maria landed on Sept. 20. She got a particularly hearty welcome in the Bronx, home to many Puerto Ricans. Some even ran alongside her and offered encouragement. The 30-year-old Ramos finished 24th on Sunday in 2 hours, 46 minutes, 45 seconds. “A lot of people came out with their flags and started waving them at me,” Ramos said. “I tried to engage more with the running spirit, the atmosphere and the energy.” Ramos said she had offers from New York Road Runners, her shoe company and her coach at West Point to travel to the U.S. to train. But she stayed to give support to the people, her family and two sisters. “The offer was out there and they were so kind,” she said, “but I thought I just couldn’t run away from what’s going on. It’s important to cope with the crisis.” She dealt with sickness, lack of sleep and limited food options. Ramos says the 26.2 miles seemed less daunting after enduring the aftermath of Maria and Hurricane Irma. “It’s not easy, everything you want, you have to adjust your agenda,” she said. “That’s for me as an elite runner. But for the people at home, they are not even thinking about sports or TV; they’re worried about keeping their jobs and being able to provide their families with basic supplies.” Ramos, an All-American in track at Kansas State, competed in the steeplechase at the 2012 London Olympics and finished 69th in the marathon in the Rio Games. She shared photos of her training, writing “Puerto Rico rises” in her Twitter posts. She ran in 30-degree cooler weather in New York after sweltering 80-degree days in Puerto Rico. She arrived Tuesday for her second NYC marathon, having finished 15th in 2015. Ramos says the island is still “in the recovery phase” and “the reality is we don’t have enough, but we are in a better situation than six weeks ago.” Cleveland baseball player Francisco Lindor and singers Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony are among those she mentioned who have been providing assistance and drawing worldwide attention. “We’re getting more and more help from volunteers, private companies and pro athletes sending airplanes,” she said. “It’s touching the hearts.”",https://apnews.com/818e513747344e2ca44ebca1b70fd92b/Beverly-Ramos-trained-in-Puerto-Rico-ahead-of-NYC-Marathon,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico's PREPA utility creditors say power grid damage is overblown,Nick Brown,11/3/17,"Bondholders of Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power utility, PREPA, said on Friday that the damage to the local electric grid by Hurricane Maria is not as bad as the island’s government says, and could be fixed quickly with an outside energy expert in charge. Workers of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority (PREPA) repair part of the electrical grid after Hurricane Maria hit the area in September, in Manati, Puerto Rico October 30, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin BaezThe PREPA bondholders made the argument in a written filing in federal court in San Juan. The utility filed for a form of bankruptcy in June to shed $9 billion of debt, while Puerto Rico’s government filed for bankruptcy in May. It has $72 billion of total debt. The bondholders want to persuade the judge overseeing the island’s bankruptcy to pick an energy industry expert to run PREPA, from a list of names on which creditors may or may not have input. Citing their own assessment of grid damage, led by energy consultant Derek HasBrouck, the bondholders said some 95 percent of transmission assets are fully functional, and observed only “a few broken poles” among 75 distribution substations that were visually inspected. Those numbers contrast starkly with the Puerto Rican government’s assessment that 80 percent of the electric grid was destroyed when Maria made landfall on September 20, the most powerful storm to hit Puerto Rico in decades. Maria knocked out power to the entire island, and six weeks later only about 30 percent of electricity has been restored. The PREPA bondholders, who include mutual funds like Oppenheimer and Franklin Advisers, say HasBrouck’s findings prove Governor Ricardo Rossello’s administration has botched the response to Maria and that PREPA needs an outside manager. “It is imperative to retain an experienced, seasoned electric utility executive to run PREPA,” the bondholders said. In an interview with  on Thursday, though, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello dismissed the idea that damage has been overstated. “To be clear and blunt, the devastation was severe,” Rossello said. “There is no way to minimize how significant that devastation was. ”‘NOT ZAMOT’Whoever Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy judge appoints to step in at PREPA, the bondholders argued, it should not be Noel Zamot. The retired U.S. Air Force colonel was tapped for the role by a federal board that has a mandate to manage Puerto Rico’s finances. Zamot has worked with the board already on separate issues. His appointment must be confirmed by the judge. But Zamot, the bondholders argued, has no experience running a power utility. Their opposition hints at a broader power struggle over control of Puerto Rico’s financial turnaround between the board and investors bracing for big debt cuts. The squabble marks a return to a focus on Puerto Rico’s debt, after creditors stayed largely quiet for weeks following Maria, which killed at least 50 people on the island.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-creditors-idUSKBN1D32JC,Reuters,Neutral
Former Puerto Rico official denies any role in Whitefish deal,Nick Brown,11/3/17,"A former Puerto Rico official who has been mentioned in connection with a controversial contract to restore electricity to the bankrupt U.S. territory after Hurricane Maria has denied having any role in securing it. FILE PHOTO: Workers from Montanabased Whitefish Energy Holdings help fix the island's power grid, damaged during Hurricane Maria in September, in Manati, Puerto Rico October 25, 2017.  REUTERS/Alvin Baez/File PhotoIn papers filed on Friday in federal court in San Juan, Elias Sanchez, a friend and onetime adviser to Governor Ricardo Rossello, said under penalty of perjury that he “never had any kind of relationship” with contractor Whitefish Energy or its principals. Rossello has come under fire for his handling of cleanup efforts since the September hurricane, the most powerful storm to hit Puerto Rico in 90 years. After Maria knocked out electricity, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which is also in bankruptcy, awarded a nobid, $300 million repair contract to Whitefish, a small Montana company with no experience in handling largescale destruction. Rossello canceled the contract after an uproar over its provisions. But the saga was not over. Island creditors and federal lawmakers have questioned how the deal got done, with some speculating it was facilitated by lobbyists, namely Sanchez, a lawyer who ran Rossello’s 2016 gubernatorial campaign. In court papers earlier this week, holders of PREPA’s $9 billion in debt cited local news reports mentioning Sanchez in connection with the Whitefish deal and asked the judge overseeing the utility’s bankruptcy for permission to investigate it. Sanchez asked the court to strike references to his name in that filing, saying he had no contact with PREPA about Whitefish. Ken Luce, a spokesman for the company, said on Friday that its chief executive officer, Andy Techmanski, never met Sanchez. The U.S. House of Representatives’ Energy Committee on Wednesday said it wanted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to explain how it is overseeing contracts for rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power grid. Another contract, one PREPA signed with Mammoth Energy’s Cobra Acquisitions subsidiary, is also being scrutinized by Congress. Sanchez noted in his statement that he had no role in that deal, either. Six weeks after the hurricane, only about 37 percent of homes and businesses on the island have had power restored. ‘A GOOD FRIEND’Sanchez has said he no longer works in Rossello’s administration and has largely moved off the island since Maria. Rossello called Sanchez a friend in an interview with  on Thursday. “He makes no governmentrelated decisions, period,” the governor said. “But he was my campaign manager, and he’s a good friend. ”After Rossello won office in 2016, Sanchez became his liaison to the federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s troubled finances. Sanchez helped shape Rossello’s financial policy as the island entered bankruptcy in May to restructure $72 billion in debt. He resigned from that position in July. Investors had criticized Sanchez for making sparse financial disclosures and speculated that he was concealing income that would present a conflict of interest. Sanchez said his decision to resign was personal and that he was “very comfortable with everything” he did on the board to represent the island’s best interests.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-power-court-idUSKBN1D326U,Reuters,Neutral
Exclusive: Trump boosts disaster aid for Puerto Rico rebuild,Roberta Rampton,11/2/17,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday agreed to expand the use of disaster aid to help rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid and other infrastructure wrecked by Hurricane Maria, the White House said. Workers of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority (PREPA) repair part of the electrical grid after Hurricane Maria hit the area in September, in Manati, Puerto Rico October 30, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin BaezIn a unique agreement recognizing both the massive devastation on the island and its dire financial problems, aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for infrastructure projects will be released in a faster, more flexible way than is typical after disasters, a senior White House official told . The plan, agreed to with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, will also provide for thirdparty advisers to estimate how much money is requires for bigticket projects, and how it is spent ,a provision aimed at protecting taxpayer dollars in what is expected to be a massive, longterm effort to rebuild the island. “We’re doing it in a way that grants flexibility, but also imposes a mutually agreed upon set of controls,” the official said in an interview. The new agreement will see FEMA cover 90 percent of the costs for rebuilding public infrastructure, up from the typical level of 75 percent. Puerto Rico ,home to 3. 4 million Americans ,is in bankruptcy, struggling with $72 billion in debt. Its finances were put under federal control last year. Six weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, only about 30 percent of Puerto Rico’s power grid has been restored. Private sector estimates of total damage from Maria have ranged as high as $95 billion. The White House is expected to deliver a new request for disaster aid to the U.S. Congress in midNovember to help defray costs from Maria and two other major hurricanes ,Harvey and Irma ,as well as damage caused by wildfires in the western United States. It is not yet clear how big the federal tab for Puerto Rico will be. “Obviously it’s going to be a big dollar figure,” the official said. “I know there won’t be any balking at the amount of money needed from the administration. ”FLEXIBLE PROCEDURESEven with FEMA covering 90 percent of the costs, it could be difficult for the territorial government to put up its 10 percent. On top of its fiscal constraints, the storm has ground its economy ,and tax revenues ,to a halt. The federal government provided a $150 million loan in an aid package approved by Congress last month that can be used to help cover its share, the official said. “We didn’t want to create the precedent of giving 100 percent in the grant program and then disincentivizing good stewardship,” the official said. The federal government will also use relatively new procedures created in 2013 after Hurricane Sandy known as “Section 428” in the Stafford Act, the law that provides for federal disaster aid. “It’s not been used on this scale before,” the official said. The procedures will allow Puerto Rico to estimate the costs of big projects up front ,with help from thirdparty advisers ,and draw down from approved grants, eliminating the slow and cumbersome process of being reimbursed for upfront spending on each segment. The agreement will also allow Puerto Rico to access hazard mitigation grants ,normally tapped only outside of disasters ,while rebuilding the creaky power grid and other infrastructure so that the structures are more resilient to future hurricanes. “We’re going to build them back smarter,” the official said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN1D22XE,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico seeks help as Medicaid crisis deepens after Maria,Roberta Rampton,11/1/17,"Puerto Rico, still reeling from Hurricane Maria, is asking the Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers for help in staving off a Medicaid crisis that has put a quarter of the island’s residents at risk of losing medical care. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello (L)  as they take their seats for a briefing on hurricane relief efforts in a hangar at Muniz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, Puerto Rico, U.S. October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoThe territory, which has grappled for years with shortfalls in funding of its Medicaid healthcare program, is on track to run out of money to pay doctors and hospitals by early next year, leaving as many as 900,000 lowincome Puerto Ricans without care. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked Washington to waive the territory’s share of Medicaid costs ,a step that could cost hundreds of millions. Last week, Rossello returned with another request: an infusion of $1. 6 billion per year for at least five years. A dozen Democratic senators have raised the issue with the Trump administration. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has also expressed support, saying the Medicaid woes could hasten an exodus from the island, though he has not yet taken a position on specific proposals. “If you take the storm and you add already all the inconveniences, obstructions that it’s created ,and combine that with a Medicaid collapse ,then you’re really going to accelerate the number of people coming to the mainland,” Rubio said in an interview. Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told  that the administration was working on a Medicaid proposal for the island but she gave no details. “We’re looking at everything at this point. We want to make sure that we’re supportive of them to deal with this crisis – but also dealing with some of their baseline issues that they had with the healthcare system,” said Verma, who visited Puerto Rico last week. The timing and legislative vehicle for any funding are not yet clear. The White House is working on another emergency relief package for Puerto Rico, expected in midNovember. The Republicancontrolled House of Representatives has proposed including $1 billion in stopgap funding for Puerto Rico Medicaid as part of a bill to renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The program cost almost $2. 5 billion in 2016, and was projected to be at least $875 million short in funds in 2018. (For a graphic on the Medicaid funding ""cliff"": tmsnrt. rs/2yT1qWG)‘WE NEED A PLAN B’As Puerto Rico is a territory and not a state, its residents do not pay federal income taxes. Washington, which shares the cost of Medicaid with states, has long capped spending to territories. The result: lowincome states such as Mississippi get 75 percent of their Medicaid bill covered by Washington, while only about 12 percent of Puerto Rico’s costs are covered under the cap. Six weeks after Maria tore through Puerto Rico, the island is struggling to pick up the pieces, and about twothirds of its residents remain without power. The territory declared bankruptcy earlier this year and the storm has plunged its economy into deeper uncertainty, exacerbating the Medicaid crisis. “I am worried about my patients. I am worried about myself. I have a family and obligations,” said Ivan GonzalezCancel, a heart surgeon at Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico, who said he expects the territory to run out of Medicaid money in February. “I have been talking to many people for years saying, ‘We need a Plan B,’” Gonzalez said. “They are counting on that money. ”The hurricane is one of several massive disasters to hit the United States over the past three months. Congress has approved more than $51 billion in emergency aid since September and will consider another aid request this month. Carlos Mercader, a spokesman for the governor, said he hoped federal attention to Puerto Rico’s hurricane woes would lead to a longerlasting fix for its Medicaid problems. But Joe Antos, a healthcare economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that might be a tough sell in Washington, given the island’s long list of needs. “They have had no traction on this issue, whatsoever, for decades,” Antos said. “This is just a very bitter frosting on a really tough cake. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-medicaid/puerto-rico-seeks-help-as-medicaid-crisis-deepens-after-maria-idUSKBN1D158Y,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico's path to restore power shifts after Whitefish exit,Jessica Resnick-Ault,10/30/17,"ult, Scott DiSavino4 Min ReadNEW YORK () ,Efforts to restore electricity to Puerto Rico nearly six weeks after Hurricane Maria are shifting as the island’s utility and its regulators, along with U.S. authorities, removed a tiny Montana contractor and moved to triple the funding of another. Workers of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority (PREPA) repair part of the electrical grid after Hurricane Maria hit the area in September, in Manati, Puerto Rico October 30, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin BaezThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the federal power restoration effort, said it planned to boost the size of a contract awarded to Fluor Corp by $600 million, to $840 million, pending available funds. The Army Corps said it was modifying the contract to ensure “continued execution of the critical repair and restoration of the electric power grid in Puerto Rico. ”Additionally, Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority (PREPA) made its first request for help from U.S. mainland utilities, known as mutual assistance, since the hurricane knocked out power to the island nearly six weeks ago. On Sunday, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello and PREPA said they would cancel a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, after an uproar over the deal’s provisions and the Montana company’s lack of experience with projects of such a large size. Fluor, which declined comment, was already in the process of bringing in people to help restore transmission and distribution of power to the U.S. territory. Hurricane Maria knocked out power to all 3. 4 million residents of Puerto Rico, and only about 30 percent of power has so far been restored. The Army Corps’ action on Monday signals that Fluor is now the primary contractor on Puerto Rico. The Army Corps awarded the original $240 million Fluor contract. The more controversial Whitefish contract was handled directly with PREPA. Conflict over who should lead the process of restoration and oversee PREPA has hampered efforts. PREPA, the island’s bankrupt power utility, and the governor have argued that the utility should maintain control, while a fiscal control board created by U.S. Congress last year to restructure the island’s finances has also jockeyed for control. Puerto Rico’s energy commission, a small regulatory board tasked with overseeing PREPA, has begun an investigation into the underlying problems with the grid, and potential solutions for restoring service to Puerto Rico, according to a resolution it has posted on its website. Slideshow ( 5 images )ISOLATION A PROBLEMCurrently, there are about 400 subcontracting crews on the island working to bring back power. Rossello said he wants to have 1,000 crews by Nov. 8, leaning on socalled mutual aid from utilities in New York and Florida, which have crews on the island. Getting assistance from other utilities, which usually help one another after storms, may continue to be complicated by Puerto Rico’s isolation and lack of investment in its system. A private sector source, who could not be named, said the transition from Whitefish, should it be handled smoothly, would hopefully accelerate the restoration of power. He said PREPA’S goal of restoring 95 percent of power by midDecember – a full three months after the hurricane – is slow for a typical utility. PREPA did not respond to a request for comment. Whitefish said it had completed significant work on two major transmission lines that crossed over the mountains of Puerto Rico. A person familiar with PREPA’s operations said on Monday that Whitefish would complete work on critical lines despite the cancellation of the contract. Several other utilities are on the island, as well as private contractors that include Southern Co’s PowerSecure unit and Fluor. [L2N1N51N0]An Army Corps spokesman said the Corps is not currently planning on hiring those reporting to Whitefish, but the subcontractors ,Fluor and PowerSecure ,might. Officials at Fluor and Southern did not comment on that possibility. JEA, the municipal utility for Jacksonville, Florida, said it would keep its crew of about 40 people on the island, even if it no longer reports to Whitefish.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-power-prepa-idUSKBN1CZ2T0,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight panel seeks outside manager for power utility PREPA,Nick Brown,10/25/17,"The federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances said on Wednesday it intends to appoint an outside manager to lead the island’s power utility, PREPA, in cleanup efforts following Hurricane Maria. Slideshow ( 8 images )But Puerto Rico’s government is pushing back on the move, and may challenge it in court as an unauthorized power grab, according to a source familiar with Governor Ricardo Rossello’s thinking. The board, in a written statement, announced “intent to appoint” retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Noel Zamot as PREPA’s chief transformation officer. Zamot, who has worked with the board in a separate capacity, would be responsible for expediting reconstruction efforts, the board said. U.S. lawmakers have criticized PREPA’s hiring of Montanabased Whitefish Energy Holdings to help fix the island’s power grid, decimated when Hurricane Maria made landfall on Sept. 20. Some Congress members were concerned that Whitefish was hired without a bidding process, and despite the fact that the twoyearold firm had only two fulltime employees. The controversy reawakened feelings among lawmakers and Puerto Rican investors that officials at PREPA are not competent to lead the quasipublic utility, whose $9 billion debt load pushed it into bankruptcy in July. The storm cut power to the entire island. As of Monday, just 18 percent had been restored, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. The board’s announcement on Wednesday was also reigniting an ongoing power struggle between Puerto Rico’s government and the board appointed last year to manage the island’s precarious finances. Created under a federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, the board is to help Puerto Rico regain access to capital markets after it filed the largestever U.S. government bankruptcy in May. The island, trudging through a decadelong recession, has $72 billion in debt and nearinsolvent public health and pension systems. Rossello and the board have clashed, including on austerity measures like public employee furloughs. In a statement on Wednesday, Rossello said the board’s powers are limited by law to financial issues, while management of island agencies “rests exclusively on democratically elected officials. ”“Puerto Rico will be zealous in defending the people from any action that seeks to undermine this process,” Rossello said in a statement in Spanish. The source familiar with Rossello’s thinking told  his administration may challenge in court the board’s authority to appoint an outside manager at PREPA. “It might have to be challenged in court, and the government is willing to go that way,” said the source, who was not authorized to speak to media and requested anonymity. Rossello’s administration separately has its own concerns about Whitefish and the lack of transparency surrounding its PREPA contract, and plans to investigate those issues, the source said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-prepa-idUSKBN1CU2ZS,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico, Whitefish defend controversial power contract",Nick Brown,10/24/17,"Puerto Rico and Whitefish Energy Holdings on Tuesday defended their $300 million contract for the small Montana company to repair the U.S. territory’s hurricaneravaged power grid after the deal was criticized by U.S. lawmakers. FILE PHOTO: Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello attends a news conference days after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, in San Juan, Puerto Rico on September 30, 2017.   REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File PhotoThe backandforth comes as Puerto Rico struggles to restore power to more than 80 percent of the island a month after Hurricane Maria made landfall. Whitefish last month signed a deal with Puerto Rico’s quasipublic power utility, PREPA, to help fix a grid that was nearly destroyed by Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in 90 years. Whitefish was awarded the deal without a competitive bidding process, and despite the facts that it had just two fulltime employees and was established only two years ago. That drew criticism from legislators who suggested cheaper options might have been available. In a statement on Tuesday, Governor Ricardo Rossello said his administration would review PREPA’s contracting practices and forward findings to the island’s comptroller. Rossello defended the deal, saying it was necessary to ensure Puerto Rico would have workers in place quickly. “Of those (contractors) who met the requirements and aggressive schedules to bring brigades, one was asking for a substantial amount of money ,which PREPA had no liquidity for ,and another did not require it,” Rossello said. “That other one is Whitefish. ”Already in bankruptcy to shed $72 billion of debt, Puerto Rico was in financial straits even before the storm. As the island grapples to get back on its feet, power restoration is a key challenge ,and one of keen interest to contractors and lawmakers alike. Maria cut power to all of Puerto Rico when it made landfall on Sept. 20. As of Monday, only 18 percent had been restored, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. Rossello’s comments followed criticism from lawmakers like Democrat Raul Grijalva, the ranking member of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, who said in a statement on Tuesday that “Congress needs to understand why the Whitefish contract was awarded and whether other, more costeffective options were available. ”In a telephone interview Tuesday evening, Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce called the criticism unfounded, saying “Washington’s got it backwards. ”U.S. lawmakers should be admiring Whitefish for getting up and running quickly, “while the U.S. government was still assessing what to do,” Luce said in a telephone interview. The firm has been working in Puerto Rico since Oct. 2, Luce added. Whitefish, named for its hometown of Whitefish, Montana, has hired dozens of workers, largely through subcontracts, as it ramps up operations in Puerto Rico. FLUOR ENTERS THE MIXMeanwhile, the Department of Defense said on Tuesday the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a similar power grid repair contract to a subsidiary of Fluor Corp. Greenville, South Carolinabased Fluor Enterprises Inc beat out another undisclosed bidder for a $240 million construction contract set to run through next April, the DOD said in a statement. Others working on power restoration include JEA, a Jacksonville, Floridabased utility, and representatives from the New York Power Authority. Fixing Puerto Rico’s power grid is an enormous task. Maria would have seriously damaged a healthy grid, but Puerto Rico’s was hanging by a thread after years without maintenance. PREPA has struggled with heavy management turnover and a $9 billion debt load, which landed it in bankruptcy in July. PREPA has set aggressive goals for fixes, saying it wants 95 percent of power back by midDecember, a schedule viewed as ambitious.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-power-idUSKBN1CU020,Reuters,Neutral
Google parent turns on internet balloons in Puerto Rico,RYAN NAKASHIMA,10/21/17,"Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. said Friday that its stratospheric balloons are now delivering the internet to remote areas of Puerto Rico where cellphone towers were knocked out by Hurricane Maria. Two of the search giant’s “Project Loon” balloons are already over the country enabling texts, emails and basic web access to AT&T customers with handsets that use its 4G LTE network. The balloons — called HBAL199 and HBAL237 — are more than 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) above land, according to FlightRadar24.com . They navigate using an algorithm that puts them in the best position to deliver signal by rising and falling to ride wind currents. They are also solar-powered and only provide signal during the day Several more balloons are on their way from Nevada, and Alphabet has been authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to send up to 30 balloons to serve the hard-hit area, according to Libby Leahy, spokeswoman for Alphabet’s X, its division for futuristic technologies. Project Loon head Alastair Westgarth said in a blog post that Project Loon is “still an experimental technology and we’re not quite sure how well it will work,” though it has been tested since last year in Peru following flooding there. Hurricane Maria devastated the U.S. territory of 3.4 million people since making landfall last month. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Friday the death toll had risen to 49. Less than a fifth of the island has electricity, half its cellphone towers are still not functioning, schools are closed and more than 4,000 are in shelters, according to a government website . AT&T spokesman Jeffrey Kobs said the company has set up 14 temporary cell sites, and as of Friday more than 60 percent of the population was connected via mobile network, in part due to the help of humanitarian and government groups and Project Loon. Other technology companies such as Cisco, Facebook and Tesla have also pledged help or have sent teams to the island to improve communications and restore power.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-north-america-technology-business-puerto-rico-9b0e527ea3b44887897f0d7148befc45,AP,Neutral
FDA teams with medical companies in Puerto Rico to tackle shortages,Reuters Staff,10/20/17,"The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the agency was working with several pharmaceutical and medical device companies in Puerto Rico to prevent shortages of medical products in the United States as it joins a massive effort to help rebuild the island that was ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Drugmakers are working to get facilities fully online after the storm slammed into the Caribbean island on Sept. 20, knocking out electricity and causing widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency has been monitoring more than 40 drug products in Puerto Rico, where 10 percent of the drugs prescribed in the United States are made. The agency is also working closely with about 10 medical device makers to prevent shortages, particularly of bloodrelated medical devices, in the United States. Gottlieb said last week that the United States may face a small number of drug shortages due to delays in restoring manufacturing operations in the island. There are currently more than 50 medical device making plants in Puerto Rico, employing about 18,000 people. The regulator is taking steps to mitigate shortages by importing devices from outside the United States or allowing manufacturers to shift production to alternative sites, the FDA said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-gottlieb-puertorico-idUSKBN1CP23W,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico still stumbles in the dark a month after Maria,DANICA COTO,10/19/17,"One man climbs 24 flights of stairs several times a day alongside dormant elevators. Street vendors hawk plastic washboards for $20. And families outstretch their hands as crews in helicopters drop supplies in communities that remain isolated. This is life one month after Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm that killed at least 48 people, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and left tens of thousands of people without a job. It was the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century, with winds just shy of Category 5 force. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” retired schoolteacher Santa Rosario said as she scanned empty shelves at a supermarket in the capital of San Juan that had run out of water jugs — again. Maria caused as much as an estimated $85 billion in damage across an island already mired in an 11-year recession. That has complicated and delayed efforts to restructure a portion of a $74 billion public debt load that officials say is unpayable. And it has thrust Puerto Rico’s territorial status into the international spotlight, reviving a sharp debate about its political future as the island attempts to recover from flooding, landslides and power and water outages. Maria has also put Puerto Rico into the U.S. political spotlight with President Donald Trump on Thursday giving himself a “10” for his response to the devastation wrought by the hurricane. Asked when the 3.4 million U.S. citizens living there could expect power to be fully restored, Trump said it will take “a while.” “There’s never been a case where power plants were gone,” Trump said, seated alongside Gov. Ricardo Rossello in the Oval Office. “So it’s going to be a period of time before the electric is restored.” Roughly 80 percent of power customers remain in the dark, and another 30 percent are without water. Schools remain closed. Stoplights are not operating. And while nearly 90 percent of supermarkets have reopened, many have bare rows of shelves empty of goods ranging from water to bananas to canned tuna. “We’re not eating well,” said 28-year-old maintenance worker Pedro Lopez as he took a break from cleaning a damaged apartment complex. “It’s a lot of white rice and fried eggs.” Near where he stood, massive tree trunks, pieces of zinc roofs and soggy items including mattresses still lined the street — a scene common across the island. Less than half of Puerto Rico’s cellphone towers are operating, and only 64 percent of bank branches have reopened, some of them with dead outdoor ATMs whose empty screens prompt a roll of eyes from people seeking to withdraw money. A brown haze has settled over parts of the island as more and more generators are turned on to light hospitals, homes and even the power company itself. In turn, the number of asthma cases and thefts has increased. Newly precious generators have been stolen from places including a nursing home, an airport cargo terminal and a hospital. Nearly 5,000 people remain in shelters, with many using rainwater to shower. “Life has changed dramatically,” said Gilberto Del Orbe, 50, who used to install marble and gypsum board. “I’ve had no work. Everything is paralyzed.” Last week, the House of Representatives passed a $36.5 billion disaster aid package for places including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and now a group of Democratic lawmakers are pushing for tax relief, saying that people and businesses in both U.S. territories affected by Hurricane Maria receive unequal treatment compared with U.S. states. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency also has pledged more than $171 million to help restore power across the island, and it has distributed more than $5 million to municipalities in need, as well as $ 1 million to Puerto Rico’s National Guard. Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez said the storm set Puerto Rico back 20 to 30 years, and while generators, food, water and other types of aid are still being flown and shipped to the island, people say it’s not enough. “We lost our home and we lost our car,” said Lisandro Santiago, a 42-year-old carpenter who started work just a week ago and was overseeing a crew repairing an apartment complex. He and his wife, their three children and his mother-in-law are staying in a 13-by-9 foot (4-by-2.7 meter) room that remained unscathed as the hurricane ripped the rest of their home apart in the north coastal town of Dorado. “I’m leaving Friday for Massachusetts. I can’t stay here.” He is among tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans trying to restart life in the U.S. mainland after losing homes or jobs or both after the storm. Those who remain behind say the post-hurricane conditions are draining them. The complaints posted on social media or shared over beers or candlelight dinners are multiplying: Weight loss. Roaring generators. Sporadic sleep in oppressive heat. Swarms of mosquitoes. Worsening traffic jams. Breakouts of pinkeye. Hands rendered raw by daily clothes washing. Celebrations of power coming back on in certain neighborhoods are often brief: A litany of happy exclamation points following messages of elation posted on social media are usually replaced a day later by angry emojis. Many use social media to post endless questions on post-hurricane help: where to find fans with batteries (nowhere so far); where to find affordable baby sitters as some parents return to work while schools remain closed (Many suggested finding unemployed friends); what’s the best way to wash clothes by hand (A majority of votes went to someone who suggested placing them in a big garbage bag with water and soap and shaking it vigorously). “If it continues like this, a lot of people are going to leave,” said Rosario, the retired schoolteacher. “But not me. I will stay here.” She paused and then continued to push her cart through the aisles, searching for new food options after having eaten sandwiches of canned chicken and asparagus for breakfast, lunch and dinner. ___ Click on the link below to see a 360 video of a family who lost practically everything after the storm destroyed their home and are now among the more than 5,000 people living in temporary shelters across the U.S. territory.

Raw sewage contaminating waters in Puerto Rico after Maria,MICHAEL MELIA,10/16/17,"Raw sewage is pouring into the rivers and reservoirs of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. People without running water bathe and wash their clothes in contaminated streams, and some islanders have been drinking water from condemned wells. Nearly a month after the hurricane made landfall, Puerto Rico is only beginning to come to grips with a massive environmental emergency that has no clear end in sight. “I think this will be the most challenging environmental response after a hurricane that our country has ever seen,” said Judith Enck, who served as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency region that includes Puerto Rico under President Barack Obama. With hundreds of thousands of people still without running water, and 20 of the island’s 51 sewage treatment plants out of service, there are growing concerns about contamination and disease. “People in the U.S. can’t comprehend the scale and scope of what’s needed,” said Drew Koslow, an ecologist with the nonprofit Ridge to Reefs who recently spent a week in Puerto Rico working with a portable water purification system. EPA officials said that of last week they still had not been unable to inspect five of the island’s 18 Superfund sites — highly contaminated toxic sites targeted for cleanup because of risks to human health and the environment — including the former U.S. Navy bombing range on the island of Vieques. “I just wish we had more resources to deal with it,” said Catherine McCabe, the EPA deputy regional administrator. Puerto Rico has a long history of industrial pollution, and environmental problems have worsened due to neglect during a decade-long economic crisis. A dozen over-packed landfills remain open despite EPA orders to close them because local governments say they don’t have the money. With homes damaged or destroyed, power lines obliterated and traffic chaotic, many of the EPA’s own island-based personnel were unable to report for work immediately after the hurricane tore across the island on Sept. 20. Twelve days after Maria made landfall, the EPA said it had 45 people in Puerto Rico. By Sunday that number stood at 85 — a force that Enck said was still insufficient. Less than 20 percent of the island’s power grid was back online, and while hundreds of large generators have been brought in, the U.S. territory’s out-of-service sewage treatments plants include several that sit upstream of drinking water supplies. One of Puerto Rico’s biggest treatment plants discharges into a river that feeds Lake Carraizo, a reservoir that provides drinking water for half of the metropolitan San Juan area. Several of the plant’s pumping stations remain out of service due to lack of diesel for generators, leaving sewage running into the lake. “We’re not going anywhere near it,” resident Edwin Felix, 46, said, nodding toward the greenish brown river coursing past his hillside home. That puts an extra strain on the filtration plants that give a final treatment to the water reaching the capital. Officials say running water has been restored to 72 percent of the island’s people. The water authority says it’s safe to drink, though the health department still recommends boiling or disinfecting it. In the town of Juncos on Thursday, EPA personnel warned people who were swimming in a river by an overflowing manhole that it was contaminated by sewage because a pumping station had failed, said Jaime Geliga, chief of the agency’s local municipal water program branch. “That’s the only water they get,” he said. “That’s the difficult part.” Even the island’s own water authority has distributed water from some wells at the Dorado Superfund site, according to Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who said that water has been tested and complies with all federal health standards. But the EPA said Sunday that some people have ignored fences and warning signs and have taken water for drinking from wells on other, more dangerous parts of Dorado, which was brought into the Superfund program due to dangerous levels of industrial chemicals in groundwater. The agency put up new fences over the weekend and said it had taken samples from those wells, though the results of tests were not yet available. Islanders also have been urged to avoid drinking or touching surface waters such as lakes or rivers, particularly after a deadly outbreak of suspected leptospirosis, a bacterial disease spread by animals’ urine. The EPA said it plans to dedicate more staff this week to inspect the roughly 250 small water utilities that serve remote, isolated communities and are typically in poor repair. Many Puerto Ricans fear other existing threats could have grown worse. In the southern coastal city of Guayama, residents long have protested the dumping of a several-story-high mountain of coal ash on the grounds of nearby power plant. The pile looks intact after the hurricane, but many fear the winds and flooding could have sent coal ash laced with heavy metals into adjacent neighborhoods. Benjamin Planes Lugo, 70, lost the roof of the house he built with savings from running a gas station in New York, but he said he’s more concerned about the ash, which he already blamed for his respiratory problems. The EPA said Sunday that it had visited the site and was awaiting test results. “We’re real worried about it,” Planes Lugo said. Enck, the former EPA administrator who also oversaw the cleanup after Superstorm Sandy in New York and New Jersey, said her successors should pull in staff from all over the country to address Puerto Rico’s problems. “They have to inspect every single landfill,” she said. “EPA needs to go and look at how much material has moved offsite because, inevitably, it did.”",https://apnews.com/fc9e9238f77e4053a02832040ba0ea97/Raw-sewage-contaminating-waters-in-Puerto-Rico-after-Maria,AP,Neutral

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Sixteen days after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, Maria de Lourdes Sandoval heard helicopters over her village of Bajura. She ran to signal them, forcefully waving her arms and crying for help as they touched down on a nearby soccer field. “I’m helpless. I don’t have a home, don’t have anywhere to live. I don’t have furniture, no bed, no clothes,” Sandoval, 47, told . Hundreds of villages, isolated by power outages, impassable roads and downed telephone lines, are being helped by helicopter teams from the U.S. Army’s First Armored Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade and the 101st Airborne Division’s “Dustoff” unit. Daily missions are flown out of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, which was closed in 2004 but is now being used by the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy. “It hurts because I remember how it used to be, and now it’s completely different,” said Sergeant First Class Eladio Tirado, who was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. After not visiting for roughly five years, he returned home in a Blackhawk helicopter. “Everything is so much gone. The vegetation, everything is brown, everything is dead. ”On a recent mission over Luqillo, Tirado asked the pilots to fly over his family’s home because he had been unable to reach them by phone. The helicopter circled the house. No one was there, but Tirado was confident the message would reach his family: he’s here and he’s helping. Media reports led crews to the village of San Lorenzo, which had received no federal assistance since the hurricane. Dozens of people pressed against a fence to watch helicopters land, anxiously waiting for food and water. Crews are also transporting people to emergency centers and mapping open roads so trucks can make deliveries. HOPE FROM ON HIGHRooftop messages like one near Humacao come through loud and clear. “HELP USA PLEASE P. R. ”Near Ciales, as Blackhawks from the 1st Armored Division flew over, people on a rooftop reached toward the sky to signal they needed water. Slideshow ( 25 images )As helicopters scouted the island’s mountainous interior one recent Saturday a woman held a jug in the air. They circled above houses built on top of mountains to find a level field to unload their precious cargo. One field looked open and a Blackhawk came within eight feet of the ground, but it could not land. Loaded with 100 cases of water, the helicopter flew off, leaving behind thirst and desperation. The crew soon found another needy community, Verde de Comerío, where it was able to land. Villagers quickly lined up to help soldiers pass food and water to a crowd. One woman hugged Pilot Chris Greenway to thank him for water. In less than 10 minutes, hundreds of bottles of water were given to families, emptying the helicopter. This village also needed medicine, and families with babies had no way of getting basics. Diapers and formula have become luxury goods. But every village asks for water. The lack of potable water is slowly choking these villages and helicopters can only carry so much. Every trip leaves some who get nothing. The crews can only hope they can return soon enough to make a difference. “This island will never stop,” Tirado said. “People will rebuild, we will continue forward, and they’re going to see a better tomorrow. ”Click on reut. rs/2z57zvc for a related photo essay",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-helicopter-idUSKBN1CI1VJ,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. House approves disaster funds as Trump criticizes Puerto Rico,Amanda Becker,10/12/17,"A new package of U.S. disaster assistance sailed through the House of Representatives on Thursday, despite President Donald Trump expressing impatience with having to devote federal resources for hurricaneravaged Puerto Rico’s recovery. A couple walks by a damaged tree in the Hurricane Maria affected area of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton   The Republicancontrolled House voted 35369 to approve $36. 5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by recent disasters. Senate approval is expected in coming weeks. Trump and his aides on Thursday suggested that there would be a limit to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington to solve some of its longerterm problems, although Trump is expected to sign the latest emergency package. The White House on Thursday evening issued a statement saying the Trump administration was “pleased” that the House had approved the relief funds and pledged to work with Congress going forward to provide resources to recover and rebuild. Puerto Rico has been grappling with a bankruptcy crisis and owes $72 billion to creditors. Devastation from hurricanes Irma and Maria was exacerbated by dilapidated infrastructure, including a power grid largely destroyed by the storms. In a morning tweet, Trump warned that the United States “cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P. R. forever!”FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees disaster response in the United States. Presidential aides later on Thursday provided assurances that Washington will not abandon Puerto Rico, a Caribbean U.S. territory with a population of 3. 4 million. All 69 votes against the aid package came from Trump’s fellow Republicans. Congress is expected to consider additional aid in the coming weeks but the debate could grow more contentious. House Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to Puerto Rico on Friday. Related CoverageTrump says Puerto Ricans are 'wonderful,' have 'unmatched spirit'DISASTER FATIGUESome conservatives displayed early signs of spending fatigue. Republican Representative Tom Cole, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, said some lawmakers have urged him to find ways to offset the costs of disaster relief. Besides the latest aid package, Congress last month approved $15. 25 billion to help with earlier storm damages, including Hurricane Harvey’s impact in Texas, and wildfires. “There is some concern about can we couple some of this (disaster aid) with reform measures,” Cole told  on Wednesday. That could include savings to a national flood insurance program or other steps, he added. Besides helping Puerto Rico recover from Maria, the bill would also provide funds for stormstruck areas of Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and fireravaged California. Cole said the price tag could rise as relief efforts transition from emergency response to rebuilding. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which has a sizeable Puerto Rican community, told  he had urged Trump to create a highlevel task force to provide advice for rebuilding Puerto Rico, and that the president was receptive to the idea. Much of Puerto Rico remains without electricity or running water three weeks after Maria’s landfall. “They’re basically three weeks now living in the 19th century,” Rubio said. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters the Trump administration would “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done. ”Slideshow ( 6 images )But Trump’s top legislative aide warned against expecting Washington’s help for longterm infrastructure problems. “The president is committed to helping to make sure that we do what is necessary to help to rebuild the island, but there are some elements that preexisted the hurricane,” Marc Short said on CNN. The House bill includes $18. 7 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund. Of that, $4. 9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31. Other funds include $576. 5 million for wildfire control. Some $16 billion would go to help the National Flood Insurance Program cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit. In its statement, the White House said it urged Congress to adopt reforms to the program to ensure its “longterm financial viability. ”Democratic Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, chastised Trump. “The president of the United States is tweeting out threats to withdraw assistance, that is an outrage, that is an insult,” Velazquez said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress-idUSKBN1CH1A7,Reuters,Neutral

"In the mountains of Puerto Rico, hurricane recovery is slower",Hugh Bronstein,10/10/17,"In the lowlands of Trujillo Alto, a sprawling suburb of San Juan, clean water once again flows in the homes of most residents. But in the mountainous part of the city, which is largely poor and semirural, finding clean water remains a daily struggle. Slideshow ( 13 images )Across Puerto Rico, officials say, altitude matters. While workers are making steady progress restoring power and running water to coastal regions, where the territory’s largest cities are located, the mountainous regions at the island’s center are proving challenging. “Are people in the mountains in a worse situation than urban people? Of course,” said Puerto Rico’s minister of public policy, Ramon Rosario, “because they are more distant from the power generators on the coasts. ” Without electricity, he noted, the pumps that carry water up into the mountains can’t operate or must rely on generators. A mix of Puerto Ricans live in the “Cordillera Central,” or central range of Puerto Rico, which is far more sparsely populated than coastal regions. Many residents are poor, living in rural, agrarianbased communities. But the region also has wealthy residents seeking the cooler temperatures and beauty of the cordillera. In Trujillo Alto, a community of 85,000 that sits partly on flat land but also extends into the mountains, hurricane recovery varies sharply by altitude. Lydia Perez Molina, 72, still relies on governmentprovided food and water in her mountaintop home, where she weathered hours of howling winds and hammerblow rains during the Sept. 20 storm. “Water came in through the window and the wind was like a monster,” Perez Molina said.

Moving heavy trucks and machinery into mountain areas to clear hazards and restore electrical lines is proving difficult, too, said a civilian employee of the Army Corps of Engineers, who was deployed to Puerto Rico to work on restoring the electrical grid.

UPDATE 3-Trump asks Congress for $4.9-billion loan to Puerto Rico,Roberta Rampton,10/10/17,"U.S. President Donald Trump asked Congress on Tuesday for a loan of $4. 9 billion to help the cashstrapped Puerto Rican government pay urgent bills as the U.S. territory struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, an administration official said. The request came as the oversight board charged with resolving Puerto Rico’s debt crisis warned the U.S. territory was at risk of being unable to pay for essential services such as salaries for teachers, first responders and healthcare providers. “The best estimate of the Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB) and government is that the commonwealth will run out of money at the end of this month,” the board told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter on Tuesday evening. Weighed down by nearly $72 billion in debt, Puerto Rico struggled with liquidity even before the most powerful hurricane in almost 90 years wiped out the island’s power grid, homes and other infrastructure nearly three weeks ago. It will take months and billions of dollars to rebuild the grid, and the impacts of the storm have cratered the economy of Puerto Rico, home to 3. 4 million American citizens, which declared bankruptcy in May. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello had warned two weeks ago that his government was in a bind and would need lines of credit. Trump’s loan proposal was “an important first step for the transformation” of Puerto Rico, Rossello said on social network Twitter on Tuesday. The proposed community disaster loan would include a $150million advance, the Trump administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Further details of the loan were not immediately available. “The $4. 9billion loan would help them with shortterm liquidity problems in financing,” the official said, giving examples such as payroll and pensions. “The money cannot be used for debt service. ”On Saturday, Rossello wrote to Trump pleading for a “down payment on hurricane recovery efforts” in the form of a broad assistance package of at least $4. 6 billion, as the island assesses the damage. “Absent extraordinary measures to address the halt in economic activity in Puerto Rico, the humanitarian crisis will deepen,” Rossello said in the letter, warning of a possible exodus to the mainland United States. Moody’s last week estimated the hurricane’s cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, ranges from $45 billion to $95 billion. The Trump administration and Congress have focused funding efforts on immediate disaster relief. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives will consider a request for a further $13 billion in disaster relief funds for hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The White House has also asked federal agencies to estimate by Oct. 25 the funds needed for longerterm rebuilding.

Tents have taken the place of post offices wrecked by Maria. Mail carriers gather information on sick and elderly residents in farflung parts where hospitals have closed. Data is fed into the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief office in San Juan so medical attention can be provided. Restoration of the power grid is months away and many rural roads are blocked by mudslides, sink holes and downed trees and telephone poles. Since the start of the month the Postal Service has nonetheless been delivering letters and care packages to family members desperate for news. “It’s been a clutch situation, and you guys have totally come through,” a FEMA worker was heard telling Postal Service Caribbean customer service manager Martin Caballero on Sunday. “We might know the general area where people need help, but the mail carriers are the only ones who really have the exact addresses,” the FEMA worker told , asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to news media. Caballero regularly goes on AM radio, which can be heard by listeners lucky enough to have diesel to run generators, to tell people in inaccessible parts of the island where their mail is being held. He invites them to pick it up, but only when travel conditions become safe. Even for urban middleclass customers in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo, whose concrete homes were not smashed by the storm, it was a chore to recover their blownaway mailboxes or build new ones. Hurricane or not, the Postal Service will not drop off mail without a designated box. “The wind took them all,” said resident Jenny Amador, a 42yearold teachers’ assistant. “I found mine in those trees,” she said, pointing to a gnarl of branches and trunks on the road. She reattached her mailbox in a cockeyed position in front of her house, using a clothes hanger. One plucky woman, having heard the postman was on the way, stood stoically with her mailbox tucked under her arm. No one minded when mail carrier Alfredo Martinez showed up out of uniform, unable to do laundry for lack of clean water. One resident said the return of the mail service was comforting, a sign of a return to normalcy. But another greeted Martinez with a warning. “If you are bringing me any utility bills, go away,” she said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-mail-idUSKBN1CE15G,Reuters,Neutral
Google to use balloons to provide Puerto Rico cell service,David Shepardson,10/6/17,"The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017.   REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PictureWASHINGTON () ,The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said late on Friday it had approved Alphabet Inc’s application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico through balloons. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites. Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solarpowered, highaltitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to “support licensed mobile carriers’ restoration of limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico. Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. “It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services,” Pai said in statement. Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a “great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow. ”Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago. Musk said he was diverting resources from a semitruck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and “increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas. ”In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-cellular-idUSKBN1CC02F,Reuters,Neutral
"Trump sees ‘miracle’ Puerto Rico survival, ignores critics",JILL COLVIN and CALVIN WOODWARD,10/4/17,"Touring a small slice of Hurricane Maria’s devastation, President Donald Trump congratulated Puerto Rico on Tuesday for escaping the higher death toll of “a real catastrophe like Katrina” and heaped praise on the relief efforts of his administration without mentioning the sharp criticism the federal response has drawn. “Really nothing short of a miracle,” he said of the recovery, an assessment at odds with the despair of many still struggling to find water and food outside the capital city in wide swaths of an island where only 5 percent of electricity customers have power back. The governor of Puerto Rico said late Tuesday that the official death toll has been increased to 34 from 16. In the heart of San Juan, in fact, a few miles from the air base where Trump gave his thumbs-up report on progress, people stacked sewage-fouled clothes and mattresses outside houses and businesses lacking electricity nearly two weeks after the storm. “Nobody’s come,” said Ray Negron, 38, collecting debris in the Playita neighborhood. Trump pledged an all-out effort to help the island while adding, somewhat lightly: “Now I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that’s fine. We’ve saved a lot of lives.” Known deaths from Maria in the U.S. territory stand at 34. But local officials caution that any accounting of death and destruction is far from complete as people suffer secondary effects from thirst, hunger and extreme heat without air conditioning. As for Katrina, as many as 1,800 people died in 2005 when levees protecting New Orleans broke, a toll in lives and property that took years to understand. The visit offered fresh evidence of the unconventional path Trump has taken in responding to the one-two-three punch from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. His effusive praise for federal relief efforts has overshadowed his displays of empathy for those who are suffering. And in Puerto Rico, in particular, his criticism of local people for not doing more to help themselves has struck an off note during a time of crisis. Trump said his visit was “not about me” but then praised local officials for offering kind words about his administration’s recovery effort and invited one to repeat the “nice things” she’d said earlier. Trump also singled out Gov. Ricardo Rossello for “giving us the highest praise.” “Every death is a horror,” he said, “but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous, hundreds of and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody has ever seen anything like this.” He told local officials “you can be very proud of all your people, all of our people working together.” Trump’s most prominent critic in Puerto Rico, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, joined other officials at the air base for a briefing with him, shook the president’s hand and said afterward she hoped he now understood the gravity of the situation. But his comment implying Maria was not a Katrina-level event left her unsure. “Sometimes his style of communication gets in the way,” she told CNN. “I would hope that the president of the United States stops spouting out comments that really hurt the people of Puerto Rico.” On a more positive note, Cruz said: “I saw a real connection between the reality and the White House staff. I think they finally understood.” Air Force One brought the president, first lady Melania Trump and aides to Puerto Rico for a tour stretching through the afternoon. At least parts of the itinerary seemed drawn to ensure a friendly reception: Trump visited with selected families waiting on their laws on a street lined with debris, including tree limbs and corrugated metal siding. Trump posed for photos, asked the residents what it was like during the storm and pledged his assistance. “Thank you for being here, it’s so good to see you,” one man said in Spanish. Up the road in the upscale Guaynabo neighborhood, one of the fastest to recover, around 200 people cheered Trump’s visit to a local church being used to distribute supplies. Many crowded around him for cellphone photos as he handed out flashlights and tossed rolls of paper towels into the friendly crowd. “There’s a lot of love in this room, a lot of love,” Trump said. “Great people.” Asked by the AP what he has to say to people still without power, food and water, he spoke of the generators brought to the island and said the electrical grid is being fixed. “Again, the job that’s been done here is really nothing short of a miracle,” he said. Earlier, on approach to the airport, Air Force One descended over a landscape marked by mangled palm trees, metal debris strewn near homes and patches of stripped trees, yet with less devastation evident than farther from San Juan. For much of his tour, Trump remained focused primarily on drawing praise. “I appreciate your support and I know you appreciate ours,” Trump said. “Our country has really gone all out. It’s not only dangerous, it’s expensive. But I consider it a great honor.” Large-scale protests against Trump, talked about in advance, failed to materialize by early afternoon, with only a few knots of people gathering around San Juan. As he headed out from the White House to visit the island, Trump told reporters “it’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done.” The trip is Trump’s fourth to areas battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the U.S. Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and hit by high winds. Trump’s visit follows a weekend in which he had aggressively pushed back against critics, including Cruz. He had responded angrily on Twitter, deriding the “poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.” “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,” he added, scoffing at “politically motivated ingrates” who had criticized the federal work, and insisting that “tremendous progress” was being made. Cruz had begged the administration to “make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives” and said federal inefficiency was killing people. Trump and his wife also visited Navy and Marine Corps personnel on the flight deck of the USS Kearsarge, landing on the deck in Marine One. On the flight back to Washington, Trump told reporters he’d heard no criticism while on the ground. “No, we only heard thank you’s from the people of Puerto Rico,” he said, adding, “I think it meant a lot to the people of Puerto Rico that I was there.” Even before the storm hit on Sept. 20, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island’s power lines, in a sorry state. Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island’s entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said more than 12,000 federal officials are now on the ground on the island, and 45 percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 70 percent of retail gas stations now up and running. ___ Woodward reported from Washington.

Mental health concerns in aftermath of Puerto Rico hurricane,MICHAEL MELIA and DANICA COTO,10/4/17,"Locked out of his home and with nowhere else to go, Wilfredo Ortiz Marrero rode out Hurricane Maria inside a Jeep, which was lifted off its wheels by floodwaters in the parking lot. He then endured days without enough food or running water. The lights are back on at his residence for low-income elderly people in the San Juan suburb of Trujillo Alta, and food has started arriving, but he still waits as long as he can each night to leave the company of others in the lobby. Alone in his room, he sometimes starts to shake. “You get really depressed,” he said Wednesday. The hurricane that pummeled Puerto Rico two weeks ago and the scarcity-marked aftermath are taking a toll on islanders’ equilibrium. The U.S. territory’s government counted two suicides among the death toll, which now stands at 34, and with many communities still waiting for power and clean water, there is concern about others reaching a breaking point. Students and staff at Ponce Health Sciences University are visiting shelters and people in the hardest-hit communities to provide psychological help, among other services, said Alex Ruiz, special assistant to the university’s president. “People’s whole worlds were taken from them,” he said. “People will need the proper psychological help to get through this.” At a news conference on Wednesday, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said the death toll jumped to 34 from 16 on the basis of a report that he commissioned to consult with hospitals and gain a more complete picture of the number of victims. He said 20 deaths resulted directly from the storm, including drownings and those killed in mudslides. The count also includes sick and elderly who died in the aftermath of the hurricane, including some who died because oxygen could not be delivered amid power outages. There were also two suicides, but Rossello did not provide details of those. One elderly woman took her own life Sunday inside a nursing home in Rio Piedras, a San Juan suburb. While the facility’s director, Maria Betancourt, said she didn’t believe the woman was distressed about the storm, the home was stifling hot on Wednesday after power was wiped out nearly a month ago when Hurricane Irma sideswiped the island on Sept. 7, though a generator has kept the lights on. Outside the home there were piles of garbage and fallen tree limbs piled on the side of the road. Ortiz and other residents of the low-income housing residence in Trujillo Alta said the building administration ordered them to leave ahead of Hurricane Maria, saying the building wasn’t equipped to weather the storm. Some were picked up by family, but Ortiz had no relatives to come get him and had no choice but to stay in his Jeep until the storm subsided and a chain on the building’s door was removed. Another resident, Felix Manuel Lopez, a 73-year-old U.S. Army veteran, said he has seen a Veterans Affairs counselor to help with anxiety that came back after he returned from a shelter to his darkened apartment. “Everybody’s drained,” said Ruiz, the Ponce university official, who recently toured the city on the island’s southern coast to assess people’s needs. “Spirits have been broken.” On Wednesday, the governor said power has been restored to 8.6 percent of Puerto Rico’s customers and the government is hoping to have power back on for 25 percent within a month. Power is being restored at hospitals, and he said the government is looking into which schools can reopen. “While we are still in an emergency we are transitioning to establishing some components of normalcy,” Rossello said. Dr. Olga Rodriguez, the dean of the Ponce Health Science University’s school of medicine, said mental health problems have increased after the hurricane and need to be dealt with swiftly. “This is very important so as to minimize the impact and emotional effects,” she said. “It’s not easy. We’re reaching some people, but the island needs more mental health professionals. If we don’t act, the situation can become problematic.” “People are unable to go to work, they cannot produce, they do not know when they can return to work,” she said. “There’s widespread despair.” ____ Coto reported from San Juan.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-health-caribbean-ap-top-news-hurricane-maria-402e7ef006d547f5a88cc04efb57ed35,AP,Neutral

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoCommittee Chairman Rob Bishop said in a press call on Wednesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal partners will also likely be engaged for years in helping Puerto Rico get back on its feet. Bishop added that an emergency response will be executed through FEMA and local officials. “An emergency funding package is taking place as we speak to support those efforts,” he said. On Tuesday a White House official told  the White House was preparing a $29 billion disaster aid request to be sent to Congress after hurricanes hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The request was expected to come on Wednesday. It will combine nearly $13 billion in new relief for hurricane victims with $16 billion for the governmentbacked flood insurance program. Bishop said under evaluation was also the question of whether to modify or give additional power to the oversight board tasked with overseeing Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were battered by hurricanes Irma and Maria. Hurricane Maria knocked out power to Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million residents last month, devastating the island’s already dilapidated electric power infrastructure. Following a closeddoor meeting of the committee, Puerto Rico’s Republican delegate, Jenniffer Gonzalez, told reporters there are ongoing discussions among members of Congress, White House aides and the Treasury Department over a possible shortterm loan to Puerto Rico, which she said will face a liquidity crisis in November. She said it was unclear whether Trump might be able to issue an executive order, if he so desired, to provide quick financial help or whether Congress would have to act. Representative Raul Grijalva, the senior Democrat on the panel, said of PROMESA after the meeting: “I said let’s open it up and see what is working and see what is not applicable in this situation, what we need to suspend. ”PROMESA is the federal 2016 rescue law under which Puerto Rico in May filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress-idUSKBN1C92BY,Reuters,Neutral
Mexico plans aid for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria,Reuters Staff,10/4/17,"Suffering itself after two major earthquakes last month, Mexico plans to send aid including water and electricity experts to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. The gesture, announced by the Mexican government on Wednesday, follows an awkward series of exchanges between Mexico and the United States over emergency aid in recent weeks. Mexico plans to send some 30 tons of bottled water, mosquito repellent and specialists in power generation, transmission and distribution from the state power utility, Mexico’s foreign ministry said in a statement. The Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) team would work to mitigate the damage and assist in restoring power supply after Maria, the ministry said. The strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, Maria caused at least 34 deaths and inflicted widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including wiping out power across the Caribbean island. Mexico has had strained relations with its northern neighbor since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, promising to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. Mexico had planned to send material assistance to the United States after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in late August, but later withdrew the offer after the first of the two quakes struck southern Mexico in early September. Trump was criticized in Mexico for the time he took to offer condolences to his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pena Nieto, over the first quake, which killed at least 98 people. The U.S. president later said he had been unable to reach Pena Nieto because of poor cellphone reception. Ironically, after Maria struck Puerto Rico, the local cellphone operator of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim proved more reliable than some U.S. competitors during the early days of the communications outage across the island of 3. 4 million people.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-mexico/mexico-plans-aid-for-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria-idUSKBN1C925G,Reuters,Neutral

"Trump praises response to Puerto Rico, says crisis straining budget",Roberta Rampton,10/3/17,"U.S. President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction on Tuesday with the federal response to Hurricane Maria’s devastation of Puerto Rico, despite criticism that the government was slow to address the crisis. Russian state TV puts blame for unrest on the West Trump throws paper towels into crowd in Puerto Rico01:15Trump, who has grappled with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the past six weeks, said at a briefing that the disasters were straining the U.S. budget. “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico,” he said. “And that’s fine. We’ve saved a lot of lives. ”Two weeks after it was hit by the worst hurricane in 90 years, many of Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million residents are still struggling without basic necessities. Shortly after Trump left Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rosello said the death toll had risen from 16 to 34. The U.S. territory’s economy already was in recession before Hurricane Maria and its government had filed for bankruptcy in the face of a $72 billion debt load. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the island’s debt would have to be erased. “They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we’re going to have to wipe that out. You’re going to say goodbye to that, I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that,” Trump said in the interview, conducted while he visited the island. Moody’s on Tuesday estimated Maria’s total cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, at $45 billion to $95 billion and significant relief from the federal government would be required. Trump said the federal response to Maria compared favorably with a “real catastrophe like Katrina,” the 2005 storm that swamped Louisiana and Mississippi and killed more than 1,800. “What’s happened in terms of recovery, in terms of saving lives ,16 lives that’s a lot ,but if you compare that to the thousands of people who died in other hurricanes that frankly were not nearly as severe,” he said.

It is still difficult for residents to get a cell phone signal or find fuel for their generators or cars. About 88 percent of cellphone sites are still out of service. On Air Force One on his return flight to Washington, Trump said it had been a “great day” and he had heard no criticism during his day in Puerto Rico. “We’ve only heard ‘thank yous’ from the people of Puerto Rico,” he said. “It is something I enjoyed very much today. ”He said local truck drivers are still needed to help distribute supplies. ‘STOP BLAMING’ PUERTO RICOIn Washington, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Republican President Trump should “stop blaming Puerto Rico for the storm that devastated their shores” and should start trying to make the situation better. The White House is preparing to ask Congress for a $29 billion aid package for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by natural disasters, a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Additional requests from the administration are expected for longerterm assistance to Puerto Rico, as well as Texas and Florida, which also were hit by powerful storms in recent weeks.

He and his wife, Melania, met survivors of the disaster in the town of Guaynabo, walking down a street and talking to several families whose homes were damaged. Sidewalks were piled with debris. “You know who helped them? God helped them. Right?” Trump said. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has criticized the administration’s response to Puerto Rico, was among those Trump met with during his visit to the territory.

On CNN, Cruz said she told Trump, “This is about saving lives; it’s not about politics. ”Trump took a helicopter tour of the destruction, seeing hills that are normally lush and green, brown and bare after Maria’s winds stripped the branches.

A man stands inside of a destroyed supermarket by Hurricane Maria in Salinas, Puerto Rico. REUTERS/Alvin BaezSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz led the attack on the administration’s response on Friday, criticizing an official’s description of relief efforts as a “good news story” and urging Trump to act more decisively. Trump fired back at Cruz on Twitter, accusing her of “poor leadership. ”It is not clear if the two will meet during Trump’s visit. “She (Cruz) has been invited to participate in the events tomorrow, and we hope those conversations will happen and that we can all work together to move forward,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday. Trump will spend “significant time” on the island. He is due in Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with people affected by Sunday’s mass shooting. For 72yearold Angel Negroni of Juana Matos, the situation has begun to improve as flood waters receded from his neighborhood, located 20 minutes from San Juan. Locals could occasionally get spotty cellular service, an improvement from the communication vacuum of days earlier. And he can trade his neighborhood’s restored municipal water for ice made by a friend’s generatorpowered freezer. “It’s better now,” said Negroni, while standing on his covered porch on Monday, cooking fish on a propanepowered camping stove. “We’re OK. ”At least 5. 4 percent of customers in Puerto Rico had their power restored by midmorning on Monday, according to the U.S. Energy Department, with San Juan’s airport and marine terminal and several hospitals back on the power grid. It said the head of Puerto Rico’s power utility expects 15 percent of electricity customers to have power restored within the next two weeks. Mobile phone service is still elusive. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Monday 88. 3 percent of cellphone sites ,which transmit signals to create a cellular network ,were out of service, virtually unchanged from 88. 8 percent on Sunday.

The ramping up of fuel supplies should allow more Puerto Ricans to operate generators and travel more freely. “We’ve been increasing the number of gas stations that are open,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said at a news briefing, with more than 720 of the island’s 1,100 gas stations now up and running. Puerto Rico relies on fuel supplies shipped from the mainland United States and distribution has been disrupted by the bad state of roads. Within the next couple of days, Rossello expects 500,000 barrels of diesel and close to 1 million barrels of gasoline to arrive on the island. All of Puerto Rico’s primary ports have reopened but many still have restrictions, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. At least four tankers carrying fuel are waiting to unload with two more on the way, according to Thomson  shipping data. “The flow is coming, gasoline is getting here,” Rossello said. “We have been able to reduce the time that it takes to get gasoline and diesel at different stations. ”Federal and local authorities were working together to keep 50 hospitals operational and Rossello said the U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort would arrive in Puerto Rico between Tuesday and Wednesday. RUNNING OUT OF CASHAs it tries to get back on its feet, Puerto Rico is in danger of running out of cash in a matter of weeks because the economy has come to a halt in the hurricane’s aftermath, Rossello told the local El Nuevo Dia newspaper in an interview published on Monday. After filing for the largest U.S. local government bankruptcy on record in May, Puerto Rico owes about $72 billion to creditors and another $45 billion or so in pension benefits to retired workers. What little cash it has is now being diverted to emergency response while it works to secure aid from the federal government. The grinding halt to the economy will delay a fiscal recovery plan and negotiations with creditors. “There is no cash on hand. We have made a huge effort to get $2 billion in cash,” Rossello said in the interview. “But let me tell you what $2 billion means when you have zero collection: it’s basically a month government’s payroll, a little bit more. ”Trump’s administration is preparing to ask Congress for $13 billion in aid for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by natural disasters, congressional sources said.

Creditors approached Puerto Rico with offers after Maria: official,Stephanie Kelly,10/2/17,"Creditors approached Puerto Rico’s government with offers surrounding the U.S. territory’s bankruptcy after Hurricane Maria tore through the island last month, but federal aid remains the top priority, a Puerto Rico official said on Monday. “Any offer we’ll review it, and we’ll discuss it with the oversight board and their advisers,” said Christian Sobrino, Governor Ricardo Rossello’s official liaison to the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board. The board is charged with helping Puerto Rico craft and follow a blueprint for the financial recovery from its massive debt crisis. No offers by creditors have been put in place and the government has not met with creditor groups on the proposals, Sobrino said, adding that communications remain a challenge on the island. Creditors of Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power utility PREPA already offered a $1 billion loan and a discount on existing debt last week after Maria knocked out power to Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million residents, but the government shut down the proposal, calling it a “publicity stunt. ”Puerto Rico, which declared bankruptcy in May, is weighed down by nearly $72 billion in debt. Last month Puerto Rico’s government requested a fourweek extension to meet key deadlines in its bankruptcy case after Maria. Sobrino said there are hearings regarding the bankruptcy scheduled for late October and November. Puerto Rico is in danger of running out of cash in a matter of weeks because the economy has come to a halt in the hurricane’s aftermath, Rossello told local newspaper El Nuevo Dia in an interview published on Monday. “There is no cash on hand. We have made a huge effort to get $2 billion in cash,” Rossello said. “But let me tell you what $2 billion means when you have zero collection: it’s basically a month government’s payroll, a little bit more. ”BOARD’S REASSESSMENT OF FISCAL PLANEarlier on Monday, oversight board member Andrew Biggs told  that the board will assess how damage from Maria will alter the U.S. territory’s “economic picture. ”Puerto Rico’s certified fiscal plan continues to be in place without changes, Sobrino said. The hurricane’s impact on the island ,including the amount of funds the government must expend, in addition to revenue collections ,still needs to be determined before decisions can be made, he said. “What we are working on and paying a lot of attention to is the liquidity of the government, especially considering you have a change in how revenue is being collected, how businesses are operating,” he said. “In that, we’re keeping close attention to how we manage liquidity in the upcoming weeks. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-board-idUSKCN1C72R0,Reuters,Neutral
"U.S. weighs $13 billion in disaster aid for Puerto Rico, others: officials",Richard Cowan,10/2/17,"The Trump administration is preparing to ask the U.S. Congress for $13 billion in new aid to help Puerto Rico and other areas hit by natural disasters, congressional sources said on Monday, with the request likely by next week. The money would help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory, leaving a large part of the island without electricity or clean drinking water and food shortages. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday amid questions over whether his administration has acted with enough urgency in helping distribute emergency supplies throughout the island. Congressional sources said they did not have a precise figure for the likely new aid request, but said $13 billion was in the range of what was under consideration. Additional requests from the administration are expected for longerterm assistance to Puerto Rico, as well as Texas and Florida, which also were hit by powerful storms in recent weeks. Administration officials said Washington still has about $10 billion in unused disaster relief funds currently in the pipeline. About $7 billion in new money became available on Sunday with the start of the new fiscal year. In addition, Congress in early September approved $15. 25 billion in disaster aid. Of that, $7. 4 billion was earmarked for the Federal Emergency Management Disaster Relief Fund. Another $7. 4 billion is for Community Development Block Grants to help rebuilding efforts and $450 million for the Small Business Administration Disaster Loan program. Last week, a senior House Republican aide said Puerto Rico will need well over $30 billion in disaster relief from the U.S. government over the long term. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and other members of Congress met with FEMA and other Trump administration officials on Monday. He told reporters on a conference call he will seek at least $10 billion to $15 billion in additional aid to begin the recovery. “We need someone to take charge,” Blumenthal said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters the administration needs to do better. “There is no dollar estimate for how much is needed because there is no plan in place” she said. FEMA Administrator Brock Long told reporters on a call on a trip to Puerto Rico Monday that things were improving with traffic moving and businesses reopening. “What I saw was progress,” Long said, adding, “I didn’t see anybody in a lifethreatening situation at all. ”But he added “we have a long way to go in recovery” and said rebuilding Puerto Rico is “going to be a Herculean effort. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress-funds-idUSKCN1C72BI,Reuters,Neutral
"Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",Peter Van Buren,10/2/17,"aria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works. Soldiers of Puerto Rico's national guard distribute relief supplies in San Juan after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria, September 24, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez  A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middleclass suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years. Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all. MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARYJulie McNamara: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico's posthurricane miseryPeter Apps: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisisAt the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint. In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead. ) I worked the Washington DCend of many other disasters. I read afteraction reporting from 2030 other such events. The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version. It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste predisaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town. Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible. At the earlytointermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm. ”The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances. Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3. 4 million people’s waste festering with fecalborne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster. )Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water. ” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can selfevacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship. Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck. That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response. Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move. Trump's Kim dilemmaNegotiate? Destroy? Tighten sanctions?  columnists assess U.S. policy options on North Korea. These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand. So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, wellbefore Trump even took office. Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing. But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.

Hurricane stresses Puerto Rico’s already weak health system,BEN FOX and DANICA COTO,10/1/17,"Martin Lopez was shot in the hand last Saturday by two thieves who made off with his precious cans of gas in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. He was rushed to Centro Medico, a trauma center in the Puerto Rican capital where in ordinary times he would be quickly treated by surgeons and sent on his way. But five days later, the 26-year-old cook was still waiting because only a fraction of the operating rooms were available due to an island-wide breakdown in the electrical power grid caused by the storm. He finally got the surgery and the hospital said he was on the mend Friday — but the same can’t be said for Puerto Rico’s badly stressed medical system. “Thank God I’m fine, I’m getting better,” he told The Associated Press in an air-conditioned medical tent set up by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the grounds of Centro Medico. “But Puerto Rico is destroyed. It’s really sad.” Of all the problems unleashed by the storm, which roared over the island Sept. 20 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 155 mph, the plight of overtaxed hospitals and smaller clinics — and health care in general — is one of the most worrying for officials grappling with recovery efforts. The health system in the U.S. territory was already precarious, with a population that is generally sicker, older and poorer than that of the mainland, long waits and a severe shortage of specialists as a result of a decade-long economic recession. The island of 3.4 million people has higher rates of HIV, asthma, diabetes and some types of cancer, as well as tropical diseases such as the mosquito-borne Zika and dengue viruses. In Maria’s wake, hospitals and their employees are wrestling with the same shortages of basic necessities as everyone else. There are people who are unable to keep insulin or other medicines refrigerated. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the tropical heat as widespread power outages mean no air conditioning. And amid the widespread disruption, it’s often difficult to get kids to a doctor, especially for families who can’t afford to drive long distances on a tank running out of gasoline. “Whenever there is a disaster that impacts an area to the degree that this one has, then yes, people’s lives are going to be in danger,” said Dr. James Lapkoff, an emergency room doctor in Waynesville, North Carolina, who was part of the HHS team dispatched to Puerto Rico. Days before the hurricane hit, 56-year-old retired government worker Damaris Torres tried to find a safe place for her son, who has been bedridden for a decade after a traffic accident and depends on a ventilator, oxygen tank and feeding tube. She has a small generator at home and a battery connected to an inverter as backup, but she didn’t want a rerun of what happened when Hurricane Irma hit just weeks earlier. Back then her son, 30-year-old Manuel Alejandro Olivencia, was transferred to three hospitals in less than 40 hours because his family was told there was no “special place” for someone on a ventilator. “He’s in such delicate condition,” Torres said, her eyes welling with tears as she recounted how a hospital in the northern fishing town of Catano finally took him in. That facility relies on a generator, but officials say they constantly worry about running out of fuel. “Diesel is the one thing everyone is asking for,” Mayor Felix Delgado said as he visited the hospital on a recent morning. Maria knocked out electricity to the entire island, and only a handful of Puerto Rico’s 63 hospitals had generators operating at full power. Even those started to falter amid a shortage of diesel to fuel them and a complete breakdown in the distribution network. Patients were sent to Centro Medico and several other major facilities, quickly overwhelming them. The situation is starting to improve, with about half of the hospitals getting direct power or priority shipments of diesel, but that barely addresses the challenges facing the island as a whole. Jorge Matta, CEO of the nonprofit that runs the complex of hospitals that make up Centro Medico, said progress was being made on restoring power capacity there and finding places to send patients whose homes were destroyed. He said they expected to have all 20 operating rooms at the trauma center back up this weekend. But other parts of the island are in much worse shape. “Right now we have hospitals (elsewhere) that need diesel, they need water, they need oxygen,” Matta said. On Saturday, authorities evacuated dozens of patients at one hospital in the capital of San Juan after its backup generator failed. They were taken to other nearby hospitals already struggling with an overflow of patients. Metro Pavia, which operates several hospital campuses across the island, warned Friday that it was closing emergency rooms in Arecibo and Ponce because it did not have enough diesel. Meanwhile medicines are running low and obtaining fuel is an ongoing struggle, said Dr. David Lenihan, president of Ponce Health Sciences University, the only medical clinic currently serving southern Puerto Rico. “If these things start deteriorating, there’s a significant amount of lives at risk,” he said. “We’re providing care, but it’s not optimal care.” At the Doctors’ Center Hospital in the northern city of Bayamon, Dr. Victor Rivera said they are so overwhelmed that he has been intercepting patients in the ER waiting room and even outside while people are still in their cars, and sending them on their way with medical advice or a prescription in non-emergency cases. Only one of the hospital’s four surgery rooms is operating because the others were contaminated when they were used as shelters after Maria ripped off the roof on the fifth floor and blew out the windows on the fourth. Rivera said the hospital, like many others, is relying on overworked generators. “They’ve been hit with an enormous amount of work,” he said, noting that the hospital had turned them on earlier during Hurricane Irma and increasingly worries they could fail. “This could potentially be a catastrophe for any hospital.” With capacity maxed out, he has been sending patients who suffer from asthma, diabetes and other conditions to other hospitals nearby. Hospitals are struggling to treat a wide variety of conditions in Maria’s wake. The first wave was people with cuts and other wounds sustained in the storm. There are also people like Lopez, who was robbed after waiting in line five hours to buy a rationed supply of gas, who have the type of non-storm-related injuries typically treated at Centro Medico. The hospital serves as the main trauma center for many around the Caribbean, and when Maria hit, it was already treating patients from the island of St. Maarten who were injured in Hurricane Irma. Centro Medico and a couple others are also receiving patients from all over Puerto Rico from clinics unable to handle them, straining the system. Gov. Ricardo Rossello has ordered that all major hospitals be placed on a priority list for receiving diesel. The U.S. Navy has also dispatched the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship that has been deployed during previous disasters such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The vessel’s sailing plan was a Friday departure from Norfolk, Virginia, with up to five days before it would reach Puerto Rico.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-us-department-of-health-and-human-services-us-news-ap-top-news-hurricane-maria-92b4cde80747487d925c55982115466a,AP,Neutral
"In hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, a stunning silence",CHRIS GILLETTE,10/1/17,"I was stunned as I walked through the darkened and humid arrivals terminal at San Juan’s International Airport two days after Hurricane Maria blasted its way across Puerto Rico. It was quiet. No military air traffic control units on the tarmac directing planeloads of aid supplies, no bustling command center sending convoys of trucks to hard-hit areas. No mountains of relief goods stacked and ready to be deployed where needed. There were a couple of airport employees mopping the still-damp floors of the terminal, the only sign of life in the vast space. A Federal Emergency Management Agency guy stood at the curb smoking a cigarette as I came out looking for my ride, and we struck up a conversation. The man who gave his name as John said he and a crew from FEMA had been pre-positioned at the Intercontinental Hotel before the storm. He told me they had spent the night moving from room to room as the ferocious winds tore chunks off the building. They ended up in the stairwell, which he said “was like a waterfall, the water gushing down the stairs like class 5 rapids.” “Where,” I asked, “is the cavalry?” ″This is it,” he replied, pointing to several dozen National Guard pilots and support people, along with several dozen local and federal officials milling around the Forward Operations Base near the civilian terminal of the airport. I covered Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Haiti earthquake of 2010, among many natural disasters over the course of 30 years in journalism. Disasters on the scale of Hurricane Maria are usually marked by the inspiring sight of thousands of military and federal emergency personnel flooding into the affected area. Navy ships offshore, dozens of helicopters and cargo planes flying overhead, military convoys heading into affected areas with supplies and repair crews. The only traffic on the still flooded highways that Friday consisted of civilians looking for gas, food, water or loved ones in the wake of the storm. Twenty-thousand troops were sent into New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina flooded the city and surrounding areas. Thousands of foreign aid workers rushed into Haiti after the earthquake there leveled Port-Au-Prince, the capital. Within three days of that quake, the U.S. had dispatched some half-dozen ships and 5,500 soldiers and Marines. In San Juan on Sept. 22, the only sign of relief efforts were beleaguered Puerto Rican government employees struggling to address the multitude of problems confronting the devastated island, while coping with their own losses from the storm. In outlying areas, residents were left to fend for themselves, clearing roads, helping neighbors, sifting through the debris of their homes. On a trip to the Guajataca Reservoir, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of San Juan, we came across a 25-year-old resident who refused to leave even though the Puerto Rico government declared an emergency evacuation, fearing the dam was about to burst and flood as many as 70,000 residents downstream. She was pregnant and due to give birth in two days, but said she wasn’t leaving because there “was nowhere to go.” Her husband said they were better off in their damaged home, than relying on government help. “There is no government,” he said, “here I have my family and neighbors to help me.” The bottlenecks appeared to be easing by this weekend, with thousands of Puerto Ricans finally getting water and food rations, even if help was yet to reach many on the island of 3.4 million people. Military trucks carrying water bottles and other supplies began to reach even some remote parts of Puerto Rico and federal officials insisted more gains were coming soon. The U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort has been dispatched to the island and the Trump administration has named a three-star Army general to oversee military relief efforts. Gov. Ricard Rossello blamed some of the problems on difficulties in getting aid shipments out of seaports and airports that were knocked out of commission in the storm, and then distributing the supplies on debris-strewn streets. As I departed on Wednesday, lines of desperate people trying to leave the island clogged the sweltering airport terminal. But at least the long-awaited aid flights appeared to be landing, a sign of hope things might start getting a little better for those left behind. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the Guajataca Reservoir is west, not north, of San Juan.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-hurricane-maria-4590c0a86dc7473589a71e15e3b05181,AP,Neutral

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsSome islanders got their cell phone service back on Sunday, others gathered at bars for drinking and dancing after the dry law was lifted this weekend. “Everyone is talking about Maria,” said Julianna Melendez, 36, while out at a bar in Guaynabo, near the capital San Juan. “A lot of people lost their homes, and they are still living in them. We need help. ”Food and drinking water are still in short supply and power is down for most of the U.S. territory’s 3. 4 million people nearly two weeks after the fiercest hurricane to hit the island in 90 years. U.S. lawmakers urged President Donald Trump on Sunday to stop sniping at Puerto Ricans and get to work helping them recover, two days before he was to visit the island. The Republican president said his government was doing a “great job” to help Puerto Rico recover and took a new swipe at critics who said he had been slow to aid the island. “We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates,” he said in a Twitter post. Trump faces difficult weeks, if not months, in managing the U.S. territory. His senior general leading military relief operations in Puerto Rico, Lieutenant General Jeff Buchanan, said they were clearing roads and getting more supplies to people, but recognized “it’s still a long haul. ”Trump has intensified his praise of the federal response after the mayor of San Juan made clear those efforts fell short and American media continued to broadcast images of the havoc and suffering on the island that belied his words. At the same time, he criticized San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on Saturday and said Puerto Ricans wanted “everything to be done for them. ”Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” the relief effort so far has been “slow footed, disorganized and not adequate. ”“The president, instead of tweeting against the mayor of San Juan who’s watching her people die and just made a plea for help, ought to roll up his sleeves and get to work here,” he said. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, urged an end to the political fingerpointing. Related CoverageFactbox: Trump on Twitter (Oct 1) ,Rex Tillerson, Puerto Rico“Every minute we spend in the political realm bickering with one another over who’s doing what, or who’s wrong, or who didn’t do right is a minute of energy and time that we’re not spending trying to get the response right,” Rubio told CBS. Trump launched his attack on San Juan’s mayor during a weekend stay at his golf resort in New Jersey, where he was attending the President’s Cup tournament on Sunday. He dedicated the Cup trophy to victims of Maria and this summer’s previous major hurricanes Irma and Harvey, “all of those people that went through so much, that we love. ”Referring to Puerto Rico, Trump said “we have it under really great control. ”‘PRESIDENT TRUMP, ANYONE, HELP US’Maria pummeled Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 as a very powerful Category 4 hurricane on the heels of Irma, with roofripping winds and torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and heavily damaged homes, roads and other infrastructure. About half of the island’s people do not have access to drinking water, and 95 percent remain without power, according to the Pentagon. Nearly 90 percent of cell phone towers are out of service, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Impassable roads have made it hard for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others to distribute food, water and fuel. Guaynabo Mayor Angel Perez said the situation is improving, albeit slowly. City employees are working 12hour shifts, going doortodoor throughout the suburb of more than 100,000, taking a census on whether residents need water, ice, clothing or other basic necessities. “FEMA is telling me I’ll be getting some money in advance instead of reimbursement, so that’s really going to help,” Pérez said, adding that damages to municipal buildings alone will top $25 million in Guaynabo. Carmen Miranda, 60, of Luquillo, is among those who has faced long lines for gasoline, medicine and supplies. She spent 13 hours one day trying to buy fuel at a station that ran dry and was in line on Saturday at a store that ran out of diesel. “I’m going to have to come back another day,” she said. “It’s just horrible, those lines. That needs to be resolved immediately. President Trump, anyone, help us!” she said. At a briefing in San Juan, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello reported that fuel and food supplies had begun to arrive in Puerto Rico. “We still need to do much more,” he said. Rossello remains in good standing with Trump, earning plaudits in the president’s tweets, while Cruz came under sustained fire from other Washington officials. FEMA director Brock Long admonished her for not being in closer contact with relief coordinators. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin both said on Sunday that Cruz’s criticism was unfair. Cruz, who has been living in a shelter since her house was destroyed by Maria, pressed on with her appeal for basic necessities as insurers and politicians began to tally the costs of the storm and the size of the aid package Puerto Rico will need. “Let us not talk about the debt, let us not talk about the cost of reconstruction.

Outside of the Fake News or politicallymotivated ingrates,” he said. “People are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military. ”The Trump administration has been on the defensive since Friday when Cruz pounded the acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke over her comment that the federal response in Puerto Rico was “a good news story. ”Trump accused the mayor of acting on behalf of Democrats. On Sunday, his representatives fanned out over the morning television news shows to chastize the tenacious Cruz. FEMA director Brock Long admonished her for not being in closer contact with relief coordinators. “The problem is, if you’re not connected into that joint field office, then you don’t understand commanders’ intent,” he told ABC. “You don’t understand the successes of what has been done versus what needs to be done, where the gaps are. ”Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin both said on Sunday that Cruz’s criticism was unfair. Mulvaney said he hoped the mayor would get on the team “as we all pull the same direction. ”Cruz, who has been living in a shelter, pressed on with her appeal for basic necessities as insurers and politicians began to tally the costs of the storm and the size of the aid package Puerto Rico will need. “Let us not talk about the debt, let us not talk about the cost of reconstruction. Let us just talk about saving lives right now,” Cruz said on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” program. POLITICAL BICKERINGTrump has alluded to the island’s financial problems several times since Maria hit. Puerto Rico filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history this year and is struggling to regain economic stability in the face of a $72 billion debt load and nearinsolvent public health and pension systems. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, urged an end to the political fingerpointing. “Every minute we spend in the political realm bickering with one another over who’s doing what, or who’s wrong, or who didn’t do right is a minute of energy and time that we’re not spending trying to get the response right,” Rubio said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” program. The insurance industry has begun to tally the damage from Maria, with one modeling company estimating that claims could reach $85 billion. Trump was accused last weekend of giving shortshrift to Puerto Rico’s recovery while focusing on the National Football League players who knelt during the playing of the national anthem at games. He issued his latest attack on San Juan’s mayor from the New Jersey golf resort where he spent the weekend. The creator of Broadway hit “Hamilton,” LinManuel Miranda, whose parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico, took Trump to task on Twitter over his attack on Cruz: “She has been working 24/7. You have been GOLFING. You’re going straight to hell. ”Conservative commentator Eric Erickson said he had planned to defend the Puerto Rico recovery efforts until the president attacked Cruz: “Yay, President Trump punched a critic — a critic who is on an island trying her best to help others where most of the people now have no homes, no power, and no running water.

Puerto Rico governor says relief arriving to storm-ravaged rural areas,Nick Brown,10/1/17,"Puerto Rico’s governor says efforts to restore cell service, gas and other basic needs to the island’s rural residents are progressing, even as many in those towns report feeling forgotten. GM invests $7 billion to rival EV competitors Puerto Rico governor makes impassioned plea: ""Forget the fighting""01:49“I recognise that right now, whether it’s the gas line or the ATM line, we’re limited,” Governor Ricardo Rossello told  in an interview on Saturday at the Puerto Rico Convention Center, the government’s temporary headquarters. “But if you see the numbers,” he said, “you see there is a steady path to improvement. ”More than half of Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million people lack access to drinking water 11 days after Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory, and 95 percent remain without power, according to the U.S. Defense Department. Some are expected to be without power for months. But on Saturday, Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) officials reported that a third of the island’s telecommunications network had been restored, and some 765 gas stations ,well over half ,had fuel, though it was not clear how much. Maria, the most powerful storm to strike Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, has destroyed roads, making it difficult to get food, water and fuel around the island. In the rural towns of Salinas and Fajardo, the vast majority of locals reported having no cell service on Friday and Saturday, and said they had not seen local or federal officials in the area. Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello speaks during a news conference days after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, in San Juan, Puerto Rico September 30, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaIn Fajardo, some 400 people waited on line to enter a WalMart store Saturday morning, while gas lines stretched more than a mile in some parts of town. “We haven’t seen a government official or anything, no FEMA, no military, no local government,” said Daniel Santiago, 51, of Fajardo, as he waited in line to get into a food store. Rossello, though, challenged the idea that the government is failing to reach rural towns ,a perception he says might be fuelled by a “severe limitation with communication. ”“I personally went to Salinas with seven National Guard trucks full of food and water,” he said, conceding that “you can always find somebody that hasn’t received resources, and I recognise that. ”Government response to the disaster has become a focal point in recent days, with U.S. President Donald Trump facing harsh criticism from many Puerto Ricans and leaders, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, for failing to deploy U.S. military resources more quickly. Trump fired back at Cruz in a tweet, accusing her of “poor leadership” and saying some Puerto Ricans “want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. ”The tweet offended some Puerto Ricans, but Rossello refused to criticise the president. “My only focus right now is to make sure the people of Puerto Rico are well,” Rossello said. “I’m not paying attention to social media. ”Pressed on the tweet, the governor said the president’s words were not aimed at Puerto Rican citizens. “When I read that tweet … I didn’t see it as assigned to the people of Puerto Rico, I saw it as a personal difference with the mayor of San Juan. ”With his island still in desperate need of financial and infrastructure aid, the governor faces a balancing act in remaining on good terms with Trump, even as many of his constituents oppose him. Trump will visit the island on Tuesday. The governor has had his hands full since the storm, saying he slept just three hours ,combined ,in five days after Maria hit.",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-puertorico-governor-idUKKCN1C60YU,Reuters,Neutral

Renewable energy investors see opportunity in Puerto Rico's demolished grid,Valerie Volcovici,9/30/17,"Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico’s antiquated and bankrupt electrical system, leaving millions in the dark and utility crews scrambling to help. Power lines are seen near Guayama  after Hurricane Maria, in Puerto Rico, September 29, 2017  REUTERS/Alvin BaezNow some politicians and renewable energy investors see a golden opportunity in the crisis to use federal funds to reinvent the U.S. territory’s grid as a stormresistant network that relies less on costly coal and oil imports and more on local wind, solar, and batteries. If it happens, it could ease power bills on an island that struggles with the secondcostliest electricity in the United States, behind Hawaii, as well as infrastructure prone to failing in the region’s frequent hurricanes. “We cannot waste the opportunity of this crisis and federal aid package,” said Ramon Luis Nieves, a Puerto Rican politician in the Popular Democratic Party, who headed the island’s senate energy committee until his term expired in January. “We need to focus on not only getting the grid back up, but improving it so it can tolerate more renewable energy. ”A set of bills introduced this week by U.S. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon would call on the Department of Energy to make the U.S. electric grid hardier against natural disasters, and would offer grants for small scale, grid connected solar and other projects. A Wyden aide said Puerto Rico’s utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), could apply for such grants to modernize the grid, or get funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild and then apply for the grants to help pay for upgrades. Efforts to reach a PREPA official were not successful. That government support would be crucial. PREPA was $9 billion in debt before declaring bankruptcy in July. Its equipment was already “degraded and unsafe,” according to a draft fiscal report the company filed in April. Around half of Puerto Rico’s electricity is generated from imported fuel oil, with another third coming from natural gas, and much of the rest from coal, according to the Department of Energy. Renewables supply about 2. 4 percent, though the island has set a goal to obtain 20 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2035. FUTURE GRIDThe prospect of a new grid in Puerto Rico has some renewable energy companies and investors interested. Jeff Ciachurski, CEO of Greenbriar Capital, a renewable energy investor in Puerto Rico, California and Arizona, said government support could open up new opportunities for the sector to take over market share. “The federal government is in the driver’s seat,” he said. Sunnova, a residential solar installer with 10,000 customers in Puerto Rico, said it was working with the governor to try to restore power offgrid in the shortterm, but said the destruction also creates an opportunity to create a new, renewablefriendly grid. “Everybody can agree that what the future and the new power industry and system look like is not what was there before,” John Berger, Sunnova CEO, told . Tesla, meanwhile, is sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Maria. A company spokesperson did not say what Tesla’s future plans were. On Friday, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said his team is looking at alternative ways to bring power back on the island, including by using microgrids, small power networks that can work independently of the main grid. Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator for Puerto Rico, said solarpowered microgrids, as well as buried power lines, could allow for a more rapid recovery after storms. Hurricane Maria left the entire island and its 3. 4 million residents without power and destroyed 80 percent of its transmission and distribution infrastructure, according to the Department of Energy. The Army Corps of Engineers has been placed in charge of restoring power as quickly as possible, a key step to restoring other basic services like water, fuel, and food.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-grid-idUSKCN1C50BF,Reuters,Neutral
Maria dims Puerto Rico’s bleak economic outlook,ALEXANDRA OLSON,9/29/17,"Hurricane Maria has thrown Puerto Rico’s already messy economic recovery plans into disarray. For now, the focus has shifted from Puerto Rico’s financial woes to meeting the basic needs of its 3.5 million people, many of whom still lack adequate food, water and power more than a week since the Category 4 hurricane laid waste to the U.S. territory. But as Puerto Rico emerges from the worst of the disaster, it will still face a $74 billion public debt load and a decade-old economic recession that has sent hundreds of thousands of islanders fleeing to the U.S. mainland. The hurricane has interrupted court proceedings and mediation efforts with creditors aimed at restructuring the debt. The destruction will severely disrupt revenue flows and force a recalculation of a fiscal plan, painfully negotiated with federal oversight board appointed to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances. While there is some potential for federal recovery money and insurance payouts to jolt a stagnant economy, much depends on how much aid Congress will approve. President Donald Trump on Friday promised the rebuilding effort “will end up being one of the biggest ever.” With so many unknowns, however, economists are unsure if there will be any silver lining for Puerto Rico. “Generally, what we find is that natural disasters are just temporary problems and in most cases after the rebuilding, things revert to the long-term trends,” said David Hitchcock, an analyst with S&P. “Unfortunately, the longer-term trends already weren’t very good.” Here are some things to watch as Puerto Rico confronts the dual challenges of natural disaster and economic chaos. FISCAL RECOVERY PLAN IN LIMBO Puerto Rico’s efforts to put its finances in order were mired in controversy, lawsuits and street protests. Now, the island must rethink everything. The oversight board appointed by Congress approved a 10-year spending plan in March that chipped away at the government’s debt load while cutting employee benefits and raising service fees. The plan must now be revised to take into account expected revenue losses and a drop in economic output. Tax collection is certain to plummet, especially if more Puerto Ricans flee to the mainland. And nobody will be paying their electric or water bills anytime soon. The Puerto Rican Power authority says it could take months to completely restore power. Revenue from manufacturing and tourism will also fall. “The oversight board has to revisit the whole fiscal plan and make a determination based on the new reality,” said Rep. Nydia Velasquez, a New York Democrat who was born on the island. “Puerto Rico today is totally different from the Puerto Rico of a week ago.” Jose Luis Cedeno, a spokesman for the board, said “all options are on the table.” For now, the board has authorized $1 billion of the current budget to be diverted for hurricane relief. That’s a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars that the hurricane is expected to cost. BONDHOLDERS IN THE LURCH The disaster is bad news for the island’s investors, mostly mutual funds and hedge funds that bought distressed Puerto Rican bonds at a discount in hopes of making a profit. Creditors can expect delays in the restructuring process and will come under pressure to accept even more reduced payments, said Ted Hampton, an analyst with Moody’s Investor Service. Faced with multiplying lawsuits from creditors, Puerto Rico sought a form of bankruptcy protection in May. The federal judge who is overseeing that process, Laura Taylor Swain, indefinitely postponed a key Oct. 4 hearing because the hurricane paralyzed the island. Funds earmarked for debt repayment could be reduced under a revised spending plan. Those were already low at $800 million a year, a fraction of the $35 billion due over the next decade. Brad Setser, a former top Treasury Department official who worked on Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, said the oversight board could allow the territory to “zero out debt service for the next few years and divert all available cash to cover its critical short-term needs.” “There is no way Puerto Rico can pay its debts right now,” Setser wrote in a blog post for the Council on Foreign Relations. The Puerto Rican government brushed aside one group of creditors who jumped in this week with new offer, accusing them of trying to take advantage of the disaster to cut their losses. The bondholders, who hold 40 percent of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s $9 billion debt, offered to extend a new credit line through what’s known as debtor-in-possession financing. That would have helped fund the power company’s repairs while also giving the new bonds priority over other creditors in the restructuring proceedings. The bondholders group replied they were disappointed in the “outright rejection of our loan offer without any discussion or counter-proposal.” But it’s not just hedge funds and mutual funds left hanging. About a fifth of Puerto Rico’s debt is held by individuals who bought the bonds because they are exempt from state, local and federal taxes and had long been considered safe. WHAT CONGRESS CAN DO Puerto Rico’s fundamental challenge is its decade-long inability to generate economic growth. The decline began in 2006 when Congress repealed a tax exemption that helped turn Puerto Rico into a global manufacturing hub, especially for pharmaceuticals. Hurricane Maria has dimmed already bleak prospects for a turnaround. There is some that hope federal relief funds and insurance payouts can help pull Puerto Rico out of its quagmire. While cautioning that Puerto Rico “faces new risks and economic uncertainty,” a Moody’s analysis said “federal relief funding in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria could offset some of Puerto Rico’s financial challenges and help spur renewed economic growth.” But Puerto Rico was so broke to begin with that is difficult to know how much extra money will be left over after storm repairs. Even before the hurricane, the Puerto Rican power authority had estimated it would need $4 billion to upgrade aging infrastructure that was already causing frequent blackouts. Tens of millions of dollars were needed to fill overflowing landfills that make it unbearable to be outdoors in some towns. Much depends on Congress, which is expected to take up a supplemental spending bill to help both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. After facing accusations that it was underestimating Puerto Rico’s plight, the Trump administration has been ramping up aid efforts. Heeding pleas that Puerto Rico was in no position to finance much of the relief efforts, the government agreed to pick up 100 percent of the costs of emergency assistance. U.S. states and territories typically cover 25 percent of the costs. Trump, who has been criticized for mentioning Puerto Rico’s Wall Street debt in a time of crisis, brought it up again in a speech Friday. “Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort — it will end up being one of the biggest ever — will be funded and organized, and what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island,” Trump said. “We will not rest, however, until the people of Puerto Rico are safe.” __________ Associated Press Writer Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this story.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-economic-outlook-3d50c7408ad241d1a005e1b2430459a9,AP,Neutral

"In Puerto Rico, a radio voice of calm in the storm",Dave Graham,9/28/17,"News anchorman Luis Penchi has slept about three hours a night since Hurricane Maria turned his radio station into one of the few sources of public information on this battered island. People talk during a show at the WAPA 680 radio station, in San Juan, Puerto Rico September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin BaezWorking more than 25 hours straight during the height of the devastating storm, the lay Franciscan friar and grandfather has emerged as a light in the darkness for Puerto Rican listeners trapped in a virtual telecommunications blackout. The powerful storm knocked out electricity, internet, television and cell service for the U.S. territory’s 3. 4 million people. When other radio stations went dark, WAPA 680 kept plugging, delivering a 24hour stream of news, advice, messages and pleas for assistance from listeners desperate to connect with loved ones. Barefoot and wearing shorts and a wooden crucifix at the San Juan station on Wednesday, the brighteyed Penchi credited retro technology for helping WAPA power through the maelstrom, along with some divine intervention. “I believe it was an act of God. This is the chosen station,” the 62yearold said with laugh. In the days and hours since the storm broke, the Spanishlanguage station has become a cornerstone of news, sending out bulletins across the devastated U.S. territory about relief efforts, road conditions and missing people. In the words of one of its owners, Carmen Blanco, WAPA turned into the unofficial “voice of the government” about the hurricane. With little working phone service, residents arrive in person at the station with messages to be read on the air. Visitors have included a cardiac surgeon who made an appeal to locate the mother of a newborn baby girl in urgent need of heart surgery so the infant could be evacuated on a special medical flight to the United States. It worked. Relief workers tracked down the grateful mom. WAPA got out the word that a nearby home for the elderly had run out of diesel for its generator. Listeners quickly responded with fuel, food and water. The station helped a kidney patient get a ride to a dialysis center, and it scored a coagulant medication for a woman within 45 minutes. The public has taken notice. “Those people are going to get some kind of award,” said Pablo Navarro, 74, a listener inspired by the coverage. “They held the whole place together. They were heroic. ”Slideshow ( 2 images )ANALOGUE RULESHoused in a modest singlestory beige block on the south side of the capital, the station sports an American flag on its logo. Inside are echoes of an earlier age that for now is the norm in Puerto Rico. With power limited to the station’s generator, there is no air conditioning. Electronic frills have been reduced to the minimum. At the reception area, a woman wrote messages for broadcast on a typewriter. Anchor Penchi credits such oldschool resourcefulness for the station’s durability. He said WAPA stayed on the air because it had maintained its old analogue broadcasting capacity alongside its digital equipment. Payam Heydari, an expert in radio technology at the University of California, Irvine, said basic analogue equipment tends to provide robust transmission over long distances. In comparison, he said, digital technology is highly dependent on electricity to power the relays needed to carry a signal. “Therefore as soon as power goes down, so do the relays” on a digital signal, Heydari said. Penchi joined WAPA last year. A veteran journalist, he returned to his native Puerto Rico from a Franciscan brotherhood in the United States to found a separate one on the island. Not long after, he also accepted an offer to work for the familyrun commercial station. The lay friar said a clergyman told him a time would come when Penchi “would be the only voice heard on the radio” in Puerto Rico. He said he laughed it off until Maria hit and he found himself one of the few voices left broadcasting on the island. Penchi said he is still haunted by cell phone calls from people contacting the station for help from their rooftops as floodwaters rose, before the storm cut off communication. “I heard the cries of the people calling in live on air,” he said. Since then, Penchi and his coworkers have done all they can to provide relief to the suffering using the power of their radio signal. Local journalists have stepped in for free to ease the workload on weary WAPA anchors. Other professionals have pitched in too. The day after the storm, WAPA put out a call for psychologists to come speak with distressed listeners arriving at the station frantic to contact loved ones. Julio Herran, 44, volunteered. He said he has been there ever since, working as long as 15 hours a day lending an ear and doing his best to comfort the anguished. “I make them realize they are OK. They are fine,” he said. “Then we write a message to put on the radio. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-radio-idUSKCN1C30HQ,Reuters,Neutral
Now even money is running out in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico,BEN FOX and DANICA COTO,9/28/17,"First, Hurricane Maria knocked out power and water to Puerto Rico. Then diesel fuel, gas and water became scarce. Now, it’s money. The aftermath of the powerful storm has resulted in a near-total shutdown of the U.S. territory’s economy that could last for weeks and has many people running seriously low on cash and worrying that it will become even harder to survive on this storm-ravaged island. There are long lines at the banks that are open with reduced hours or the scattered ATMs that are operational amid an islandwide power outage and near total loss of telecommunications. Many people are unable to work or run their businesses because diesel to run generators is in short supply or they can’t spend all day waiting for gas to fill their car. Engineer Octavio Cortes predicts it will only get worse because so many of the problems are inter-connected and cannot be easily resolved. “I don’t know how much worse it’s going to get,” Cortes said as he joined other motorists stopping on a bridge over a river in northern Puerto Rico to catch a faint cellphone signal. “Right now it’s manageable, but I don’t know about next week or after that.” The father of six typically works from home or travels around the world for his job, but neither approach is possible now because the power is still out for nearly all 3.4 million people in Puerto Rico and flights off the island are down to only a few each day. While Cortes is OK for the moment, others don’t have nearly the same resources. Cruzita Mojica is an employee of the Puerto Rico Treasury Department in San Juan. While she, like many public sector workers, has been called back to work she can’t go because she has to care for her elderly mother in the aftermath of the storm. She got up at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday and went to four ATM machines only to find each one empty. “Of course I took out money before the hurricane, but it’s gone already,” she said. “We’re without gasoline. Without money. Without food. This is a disaster.” Surgical technician Dilma Gonzalez said she had only $40 left and her job hasn’t called people back to work yet in the capital. “Until they let us know otherwise, I’m not supposed to go back,” she said with a shrug as she pressure washed the street in front of her house, sending muddy debris flying. All are struggling with the overwhelming devastation of Hurricane Maria, which began tearing across the island early in the morning of Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm with winds of 155 mph. It destroyed the entire electricity grid while grinding up homes, businesses, roads and farms. At least 16 people were killed. There still is no exact tally of the cost and full extent of the damage, but Gov. Ricardo Rossello says it will bring a complete halt to the economy for at least a month. “This is the single biggest, major catastrophe in the history of Puerto Rico, bar none, and it is probably the biggest hurricane catastrophe in the United States,” Rossello said Wednesday as he delivered aid to the southern town of Salinas, whose mayor says 100 percent of the agriculture there was wiped out when the wind tore up plantain, corn, vegetables and other crops. On Thursday the Trump administration announced it was waiving the Jones Act, a little-known federal law that prohibits foreign-flagged ships from shuttling goods between U.S. ports, for Puerto Rico. Republicans and Democrats have pushed for the move, saying it could help get desperately needed supplies to the island more quickly and at less cost. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Twitter that President Donald Trump had “authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico” in response to a request from Rossello and that it “will go into effect immediately.” Antonia Garcia, a retiree who lives in the city of Bayamon, said she was down to her last $4. She spent a day using precious gas to look for an ATM that was in operation because she couldn’t get into her credit union, which was taking only 200 customers a day. “This has become chaotic,” she said. Puerto Rico was already struggling before the storm. The island has been in a recession for more than a decade, the poverty rate was 45 percent and unemployment was around 10 percent, higher than any U.S. state. Manufacturers of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, which are the most important segment of the economy, have been shedding jobs for years. Now everything from multinational companies to small businesses and ranches are scrambling to get enough fuel to run generators while their employees struggle to even get to work. Before the storm, the island’s government was in the midst of bitter negotiations with creditors to restructure a portion of its $73 billion in debt, which the previous governor declared unpayable. Rossello appeared to warn the bondholders that the storm had made things worse. “Puerto Rico practically will have no income for the next month,” he told reporters. Making matters worse for many consumers is the fact that those food stores that are open, typically on reduced hours, are unable to process credit or bank cards or the local system of welfare payments. The businesses are insisting on cash, even though that is technically illegal. Still, as in any economic crisis, there are people who find the upside. Christian Mendoza said the car wash where he works hasn’t re-opened so he has been selling bottled water, even without refrigeration. “The water hot and it still went like you wouldn’t believe,” he said. Another relative success story is Elpidio Fernandez, a 78-year-old who sells coconut and passion fruit ice cream from a pushcart on the streets of San Juan and has a supplier with a generator. He has made up to $500 on some days since the storm. “Business has multiplied by a thousand,” he said, but he quickly added: “Even though I’m doing well, I don’t feel good because I know other people are suffering.”",https://apnews.com/d98021c8616a451e9eca958638099abd/Now-even-money-is-running-out-in-hurricane-hit-Puerto-Rico,AP,Neutral
UPDATE 2-U.S. aid to Puerto Rico seen topping $30 billion -congressional aide,Richard Cowan,9/28/17,"Puerto Rico is likely to need far more than $30 billion in longterm aid from the U.S. government for disaster relief and rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Maria, a senior Republican congressional aide said on Thursday. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said that while Congress has quickly fulfilled requests from the administration of President Donald Trump for disaster assistance, there are concerns that government agencies have not acted quickly enough in response to the storm and bureaucratic requirements may have slowed work of the Department of Defense and other offices. Disaster modeler Enki Research estimates damage to the island at $30 billion, with $20 billion in direct physical damage and $10 billion in economic impact. The aide said that the Trump administration request for additional money could come late next week or the week after. “We are pushing earlier,” the aide said. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that $6. 7 billion in approved hurricane relief funding would be given to federal emergency officials in two days to help victims of three recent storms, including the most recent one that hit Puerto Rico. “A huge capital injection will happen in two days, so the resources are there,” Ryan told reporters, adding that lawmakers will quickly act on the Trump administration’s requests for hurricane relief for the U.S. territorial island. Riskmodeling firm RMS said on Thursday that it estimated insured losses from Hurricane Maria of $15 billion to $30 billion, with Puerto Rico and Dominica suffering the most destruction. Earlier this week, rival modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimated insured losses for Maria, which hit the Caribbean last week, of $40 billion to $85 billion. They said Puerto Rico alone accounts for 85 percent of the loss. The hurricane has raised questions about how much of a role the federal government plays in solving Puerto Rico’s crisis and whether creditors would give any relief to the island, weighed down by $72 billion in debt. Trump said on Monday that Puerto Rico’s billions of dollars of debt to Wall Street and banks “must be dealt with. ”DEBT FORGIVENESS UNLIKELYTrump on Tuesday agreed to boost federal disaster assistance, ordering increased funding be made available to assist with debris removal and emergency protective measures. The question remains how large any package might be. The White House does not think it needs to address restructuring the island’s debt in its next request for funding from Congress, Tom Bossert, the White House homeland security adviser, told reporters on Thursday. Bondholders and investors have said that debt forgiveness would be unlikely as it could be politically difficult and lead to lawsuits. The more likely scenario would be that FEMA and the federal government extend to Puerto Rico aid that can be used to rebuild the island, while creditors continue to negotiate the underlying debt problems in bankruptcy. A source familiar with Puerto Rico’s restructuring said that creditors will likely wait and see what the Federal government will do in terms of an aid package before deciding their course. Anything that creditors do will likely come through mediation with the judges, that source said. The source said that there was no current pressure for debt forgiveness but any discussions over debt would have to be done in the context of a bankruptcy court. On Wednesday, creditors of Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power utility PREPA said they had offered the utility some relief, with a $1 billion loan and a discount on a portion of the existing debt ,although that got rejected by the island, which called it “not viable”. A group of creditors holding COFINA debt, which is bonds backed by sales tax revenue, said in a statement on Tuesday that they hoped the island received “necessary humanitarian and governmental assistance” to strengthen the island’s infrastructure for the long term. Since Puerto Rico filed the largestever U.S. government bankruptcy in May, creditor groups have litigated fiercely over who has first claim on the island’s limited cash. Specifically, holders of some $17 billion in socalled COFINA debt, backed by sales tax revenue, are locked in a lawsuit with owners of $18 billion in general obligation bonds who claim entitlement to all island revenues, sales tax included. Under the fiscal turnaround blueprint approved by Puerto Rico’s oversight board in March, the island has just $800 million a year to service debt ,a quarter of what it owes.

McCain introduces bill to kill Puerto Rico shipping restrictions,Timothy Gardner,9/28/17,"Republican senators John McCain and Mike Lee introduced a bill on Thursday to permanently waive shipping restrictions on Puerto Rico, saying a temporary waiver from the Trump administration is “insufficient” to help the island rebuild from Hurricane Maria. A cargo ship is seen in front of a port after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico September 24, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia RawlinsPresident Donald Trump’s administration earlier on Thursday waived the restriction known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or the Jones Act, for Puerto Rico for 10 days, after a request by Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rossello. Opponents of the Jones Act, which bars foreign vessels from shipping goods between U.S. coasts, say it hurts consumers on U.S. islands, including Puerto Rico and Hawaii, by adding shipping costs to imports of basic goods like food and fuel. McCain called the Jones Act an “antiquated, protectionist law that has driven up costs and crippled Puerto Rico’s economy. ”In 2013, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report said the Jones Act hurts Puerto Rico’s economy. It estimated that shipping costs from the U.S. East Coast to Puerto Rico are double what they are to the nearby Dominican Republic, thanks mainly to the Jones Act. In addition, the U.S. Virgin Islands have been exempt from the Jones Act for decades, which opponents of the law say is unfair to Puerto Rico. It was unclear whether McCain could gain widespread support for the bill that would waive the law, which is supported by shipping and security interests. Not only do U.S. ship builders support the Jones Act, but also a wide array of industries that build parts that go into ships, businesses that are spread throughout the country. President Donald Trump, before his administration waived the law temporarily, pointed out that “a lot of shippers and . . . a lot of people that work in the shipping industry” did not want the restrictions waived for Puerto Rico. In 1998, McCain sponsored legislation to allow waivers of the law, a measure that created exemptions that are in place today. In 2010, 2015 and this past July he introduced legislation to fully repeal the restrictions.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-shipping-mccain-idUSKCN1C32ZL,Reuters,Neutral
"Fuel imports, distribution in Puerto Rico starts to unclog",Marianna Parraga,9/28/17,"Shipments of gasoline and diesel into Puerto Rico have resumed after Hurricane Maria, with ports restarting operations, though there were still long fuel lines around the island on Thursday, according to traders and Thomson  tracking data.

REUTERS/Alvin Baez Residents lined up for diesel for power generators and to fill cars with gasoline, while at least one tanker discharged at the port of San Juan as oil terminals reopened some facilities. The territory still faces logistical hurdles to distribute food, fuel and water. Critics called for more resources and a single authority to oversee relief efforts. Most of the Caribbean island’s 3. 4 million people still lacked electricity. Gasoline stations have been unable to remain open for more than a few hours at a time, the U.S. Department of Defense said on Wednesday. The mediumsized tanker Energy Patriot coming from Canada finished discharging refined products at San Juan on Thursday, according to  data. The port has struggled to move supplies, due to a lack of personnel to empty containers from the port. “Fuel distribution is slowly starting to flow. The most needed fuel right now is diesel. Importers are working to get supplies,” one trader said. Three other vessels from the United States and the Caribbean have lined up to unload, with two more tankers en route from Europe, the data showed. As of Wednesday, Puerto Rico’s ports of San Juan and Guayanilla lifted operational restrictions. The port of Arecibo reopened for daylight hours, the U.S. Department of Energy said. Two other ports used for oil imports and to move fuel between domestic terminals ,Yabucoa and Ponce ,remained closed. Mayaguez reopened with restrictions on Thursday. In Yabucoa, U.S. company Buckeye Partners had not yet reopened the marine terminal, but a truck terminal was distributing stored fuel, traders said. Puma Energy, which runs three oil terminals in Puerto Rico, resumed operations at its 2. 96millionbarrel Bayamon facility and was working to accelerate imports and fuel distribution across the island, including power plants and airlines, the sources added.

U.S. appoints general to oversee military response to Puerto Rico disaster,Robin Respaut,9/28/17,"The Pentagon named a senior general to command military relief operations in hurricaneravaged Puerto Rico on Thursday and the Trump administration sent a Cabinet emissary to the island as U.S. lawmakers called for a more robust response to the crisis. Russian state TV puts blame for unrest on the West Puerto Ricans search for cell service amid devastation02:03The U.S. territory of 3. 4 million people struggled through a ninth day with virtually no electricity, patchy communications and shortages of fuel, clean water and other essentials in the wake of Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to hit the island in nearly 90 years. The storm struck on Sept. 20 with lethal, roofripping force and torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and heavily damaged homes, roads and other infrastructure. The storm killed more than 30 people across the Caribbean, including at least 16 in Puerto Rico. Governor Ricardo Rossello has called the island’s devastation unprecedented. The U.S. military, which has poured thousands of troops into the relief effort, named Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan on Thursday to oversee its response on the island. Buchanan, Army chief for the military’s U.S. Northern Command, was expected to arrive in Puerto Rico later on Thursday. He will be the Pentagon’s main liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. government’s lead agency on the island, and focus on aid distribution, the Pentagon said in a statement. FEMA has already placed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in charge of rebuilding the island’s crippled power grid, which has posed one of the island’s biggest challenges after the storm. In yet another move raising the administration’s profile in the crisis, acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, whose department includes FEMA, will visit Puerto Rico on Friday with other senior government officials to meet the governor, Puerto Rican authorities and federal relief workers, her office announced. President Donald Trump again praised the government’s performance, saying on Twitter FEMA and other first responders were “doing a GREAT job,” but he complained about media coverage, adding: “Wish press would treat fairly!”Related CoverageEvacuees leave Puerto Rico by cruise ship, some doubting they will returnPuerto Ricans say Trump's disaster response was too slow, too clumsySee more storiesU.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, like Trump a Republican, had earlier called for the appointment of a single authority to oversee all hurricane relief efforts, and said the Defense Department should mostly be in charge. DISASTER BECOMING “MANMADE”Democratic U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said the crisis was shifting from a natural disaster to a manmade one. The government’s response had been “shamefully slow and undersized and should be vastly upgraded and increased,” he told the Senate. Blumenthal called for as many as 50,000 troops to better coordinate logistics and the delivery of aid and basic necessities. Even as FEMA and the U.S. military have stepped up relief efforts, many residents in Puerto Rico voiced frustration at the pace of relief efforts. “It’s chaos, total chaos,” said Radamez Montañez, a building administrator from Carolina, east of capital city San Juan, who has been without water and electricity at home since Hurricane Irma grazed the island two weeks before Maria. In one sign of the prevailing sense of desperation, thousands lined up at San Juan harbor on Thursday to board a cruise ship bound for Florida in what was believed to be the largest mass evacuation since Maria struck the island. The humanitarian mission, offered free of charge, was arranged between Royal Caribbean International RCL. N and Puerto Rican authorities on a largely adhoc, firstcome basis that sought to give some priority to those facing special hardships. Slideshow ( 9 images )Defending the relief effort, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said 10,000 federal relief workers had arrived in Puerto Rico, including troops, and that 44 of the island’s 69 hospitals were now operational. “The full weight of the United States government is engaged to ensure that food, water, healthcare and other lifesaving resources are making it to the people in need,” Sanders told reporters. Army Brigadier General Richard Kim told reporters that the total military force on the island, including the Puerto Rico National Guard, numbered about 4,400 troops. Slideshow ( 9 images )SHIPPING RESTRICTION LIFTEDThe Trump administration earlier lifted restrictions known as the Jones Act for 10 days on foreign shipping from the U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico. While that measure might help speed cargo shipments, Puerto Rico is struggling to move supplies around the island once they arrive. The U.S. government has temporarily lifted the Jones Act following severe storms in the past, but critics had charged the government was slow to do this for Puerto Rico. Overall, the island is likely to need far more than $30 billion in longterm aid from the U.S. government for disaster relief and rebuilding efforts following Maria, a senior Republican congressional aide said on Thursday. The immediate relief effort was still badly hampered by the damage to infrastructure. Clearing cargo deliveries at the San Juan port remained slow, and several newly arrived tankers were waiting for a chance to unload their fuel, according to Thomson  shipping data. “Really our biggest challenge has been the logistical assets to try to get some of the food and some of the water to different areas of Puerto Rico,” Governor Rossello told MSNBC on Thursday. He has staunchly defended the Trump administration for its relief response, which Trump noted in one of his Thursday night Twitter posts. The military has delivered fuel to nine hospitals and helped establish more than 100 distribution centers for food and water on the island, the Pentagon said on Thursday. Brock Long, the FEMA administrator, told CNN he was dissatisfied with the federal response to Maria, saying operations had been hindered by damage to the island’s air traffic control system, airports and seaports. FEMA said full air traffic control services had been restored to the main international airport in San Juan, allowing for more than a dozen commercial flights a day, although that figure represented a fraction of the airport’s normal business. The island has also seen the gradual reopening of hundreds of gasoline stations during the past few days, while a number of supermarket chains were also returning to business, FEMA officials said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN1C31S8,Reuters,Neutral
Trump orders shipping restrictions lifted for storm-hit Puerto Rico,Robin Respaut,9/28/17,"U.S. President Donald Trump lifted restrictions on foreign shipping on Thursday to help get fuel and supplies to Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory reels from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, the White House said. Trump, at the request of Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello, “has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a Twitter post. The Jones Act limits shipping between U.S. ports to U.S. ownedandoperated vessels. Puerto Rico’s government had sought a waiver of the law to ensure as many supplies as possible, including badly needed fuel, reach the island of 3. 4 million people quickly. Rossello retweeted Sanders’ announcement with a “Thank you @POTUS” ,referring to Trump’s official Twitter handle. Maria struck Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, knocking out power to the entire island, causing widespread flooding and major damage to homes and infrastructure. Even as federal emergency management authorities and the U.S. military have stepped up relief efforts, many residents have voiced exasperation at the prolonged lack of electricity, reliable supplies of drinking water and other essentials. Rossello has strongly praised Trump’s response, defending the Republican administration against complaints of being slow to act and showing too little concern. Critics have said Puerto Rico is not getting the same response as it would if it were a U.S. state, even though its residents are U.S. citizens. The U.S. government has periodically lifted the Jones Act for a temporary period following violent storms, including after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hit Texas and Florida in late August and earlier this month.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-idUSL2N1M90KQ,Reuters,Neutral
‘This is personal’: NY rushes to aid ravaged Puerto Rico,JENNIFER PELTZ and DAVID KLEPPER,9/27/17,"New York state, home to the U.S. mainland’s biggest Puerto Rican community, is sending a lot more than thoughts and prayers to the hurricane-ravaged island. Between them, New York state and city have committed hundreds of workers and organized aid ranging from rescue helicopters to field rations. Gov. Andrew Cuomo took the first flight allowed to land after Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico last week, and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito joined city workers this weekend to aid relief on the island where her own mother lives. “She tells me every day not to worry about her, though the level of desperation is getting there,” Mark-Viverito said Wednesday, her voice breaking. Her mother had left her damaged home to stay with friends in a high-rise with no power and had stood in a five-hour line to get gasoline. State Assemblyman Marcos Crespo is waiting to hear from his own mother and relatives even as he fields unceasing phone calls from constituents trying to reach theirs. “The one thing that keeps me going is knowing how many people are willing to help,” said Crespo, a Democrat like Cuomo and Mark-Viverito. For politicians and everyday New Yorkers, the storm is pulling at the ties between their state and Puerto Rico. The island is 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers) away, but connections often feel much closer in a state with over 1 million people of Puerto Rican descent. “This is personal,” Cuomo said Wednesday. “Anything this state can do, we will do.” That includes committing hundreds of state troopers and other workers, plus organizing an aid package that reads like the shopping list for a small army: 34,000 bottles of water, 10,000 field rations, 1,400 cots, 500 flashlights, 10 electrical generators and four Black Hawk helicopters. One of New York’s biggest homegrown pop stars, Jennifer Lopez, donated $1 million to relief efforts at a press conference with Cuomo on Sunday. New York City has about 700,000 people of Puerto Rican descent — making up about 1 in every 12 city residents, and roughly twice the population of the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan. More than 140 New York City firefighters, police officers and other workers are in Puerto Rico to help, and Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio is preparing for an expected influx of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing the storm’s damage. The federal government has sent thousands of employees to help the U.S. territory with needs from fueling hospital generators to trying to avert a dam collapse. Republican President Donald Trump plans to visit next week. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello and Resident Commissioner Jennifer Gonzalez, the island’s non-voting representative in Congress, have praised Trump’s response. But the administration also has faced complaints that its efforts lagged responses to hurricanes that hit the mainland. Maria tore through Puerto Rico last week, killing at least 16 people and leaving nearly all 3.4 million residents without power and most without water. “It’s being felt deeply here” in New York, says Edwin Melendez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at city-run Hunter College. The center’s website has repeatedly crashed since it posted a list of ways to donate, he said. New York’s Puerto Rican population began growing significantly in the 1950s and ’60s as people left the island in search of economic opportunity. While many families have now been in New York for generations, many identify strongly with their heritage. There’s even a term, “Nuyorican,” that some New Yorkers with Puerto Rican backgrounds use to span both cultures. The city’s annual Puerto Rican Day sees one of New York’s biggest parades of the year. That’s not lost on New York’s politicians, many of whom make an annual trip to San Juan for a Latino issues conference called Somos El Futuro. Puerto Ricans on the island cannot vote in federal elections, but as U.S. citizens, they can vote if they move to the mainland. “That’s what has galvanized the Puerto Rican community in the states — because we need to speak for citizens in Puerto Rico,” said Arlene Davila, a Puerto Rico-born anthropology and American studies professor at New York University. While political calculus may be part of New York officials’ rush to respond to Maria’s battering, Baruch College political scientist Douglas Muzzio believes there’s “sincerity along with the self-interest” in helping a large, worried population. “It affects more than Latinos,” said Muzzio, whose Puerto Rican son-in-law hasn’t been able to contact an aunt on the island. Visiting a firehouse Saturday, de Blasio vowed New Yorkers would stand by Puerto Rico. “When Puerto Rico asks, ‘Where is New York City in our hour of need?’” he said, “We say simply say: ‘Presente.’” ___ Klepper reported from Albany, New York.

"‘Nothing, nothing.’ Aid lags in hurricane-torn Puerto Rico",BEN FOX and DANICA COTO,9/27/17,"Relatives helped Maribel Valentin Espino find shelter when Hurricane Maria roared through her community in northern Puerto Rico. Neighbors formed volunteer brigades to cut fallen trees and clear twisty mountain roads after the storm had passed. Now, friends and a local cattle ranch provide the water they need to survive in the tropical heat. Valentin and her husband say they have not seen anyone from the Puerto Rican government, much less the Federal Emergency Management Agency, since the storm tore up the island Sept. 20, killing at least 16 people and leaving nearly all 3.4 million people in Puerto Rico without power and most without water. “People say FEMA is going to help us,” Valentin said Tuesday as she showed Associated Press journalists around the sodden wreckage of her home. “We’re waiting.” Many others are also waiting for help from anyone from the federal or Puerto Rican government. But the scope of the devastation is so broad, and the relief effort so concentrated in San Juan, that many people from outside the capital say they have received little to no help. Valentin, her husband and teenage son live in one such area, Montebello, a 20-minute drive into what used to be lushly forested mountains near the northern coastal municipality of Manati. Hurricane Maria’s Category 4 winds stripped the trees bare and scattered them like matchsticks. “It seemed like a monster,” she recalled. The roads are passable now but the community is still isolated. “Nobody has visited, not from the government, not from the city, no one,” said Antonio Velez, a 64-year-old who has lived there his entire life. In the central town of Morovis, Manolo Gonzalez built a makeshift raft out of a plastic pallet buoyed by soda bottles to help neighbors ferry food, gasoline and other basic supplies across a river where the bridge was destroyed. Someone had already strung a cable over the 100-yard stretch of river so people could hold on as they crossed in search of supplies. “There’s no food over there,” Gonzalez said. “We have to help each other because that’s all we have.” The same complaint echoed throughout the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa, the first town Maria hit as it barreled across the island with 155 mph winds. “Nothing, nothing, nothing,” said 58-year-old retiree Angel Luis Rodriguez. “I’ve lost everything, and no one has shown up to see if anyone lives here.” At a nearby river, dozens of people gathered to bathe and wash clothes as they grumbled about the lack of aid. “There’s been no help from the mayor or from the federal government,” said 64-year-old retiree Maria Rodriguez as she held a coconut in her right hand and took sips from it. “After Georges hit us (in 1998), they responded quickly. But now? Nothing. We need water and food.” Nearby, one girl engaged in a thumb war with a friend as she filled an empty water bottle with her other hand. Downstream, a woman sat cross-legged in the water behind a friend and helped wash her hair. The recovery in the first week since the storm has largely been a do-it-yourself affair. People collect water from wells and streams, clear roads and repair their own homes when they are not waiting in daylong lines for gasoline and diesel. For most, the only visible sign of authority are police officers directing traffic, a critical service because traffic lights are out across the island. “I have seen a lot of helicopters go by. I assume those are people from FEMA,” said Jesus Argilagos, who lives in Manati and works at a grocery store that is only open part of the day because of the power crisis. “People get pissed off because they see them going back and forth and not doing anything.” There are several thousand U.S. federal employees in Puerto Rico helping with the recovery effort. They are most visible in San Juan, where officials with FEMA, Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection have a presence at hotels that before the storm served tourists in the Condado neighborhood or at the convention center that has become a staging ground for relief efforts. Federal workers supplied diesel to generators at hospitals and delivered desperately needed food and water to hard-hit communities across the island. They have repaired the air traffic control systems and power at the airport, which is far from normal operations with only about a dozen commercial flights per day. U.S. agents have also provided security across the island and the Coast Guard has worked with local authorities to restore the sea ports, a vital link because Puerto Rico is almost completely dependent on imports. In addition, teams from the Army Corps of Engineers are helping to repair the electricity grid and to inspect and look for ways to avert the collapse of a dam near the western town of Quebradillas that has developed a crack and that officials have said could potentially fail. And personnel from Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs have provided care and helped evacuate people from Puerto Rico with chronic medical conditions. A U.S. Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, whose staff can perform surgeries, also is scheduled to arrive in the coming days, said Resident Commissioner Jennifer Gonzalez, the island’s representative in Congress. Federal teams also were scheduled to visit the central mountain town of Aibonito, which was cut off from the rest of the island for five days. Many people began rationing their food and water supplies as they dwindled, unclear of when they would have contact with the outside world. “We thought somebody was going to stop by,” said Ana Lidia Mendoza, a 48-year-old cook at a barbecue restaurant who lost part of her roof. “They told us that we had to stay calm.” Gov. Ricardo Rossello and Gonzalez have said they intend to seek more than a billion dollars in federal assistance and they have praised the response to the disaster by President Donald Trump, who plans to visit Puerto Rico next week, as well as FEMA Administrator Brock Long. Rossello said the main problem is getting enough trucks and drivers to reach people throughout the island, adding that he is getting help from the U.S. mainland including National Guard troops from several states. Food, water and generators are now at reopened ports waiting to be delivered. The federal and local governments “are working together to make sure we can find our way to everyone in Puerto Rico,” Rossello said Wednesday as he delivered an aid shipment to the mayor of the southern coastal town of Salinas. Still, it is hard to avoid the fact that the response looks different than previous ones. After hurricanes in Louisiana, Texas and Florida, waves of power company trucks from other states descended in long convoys, something that is obviously not possible on an island 1,000 miles to the southeast of the mainland. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, the U.S. military sent ships and the skies seemed to be filled with heavy-lift helicopters and planes carrying emergency relief, though the scale of that disaster was far worse. Hurricane Maria was the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 100 years and officials say the cost of recovery will dwarf that of the punishing Hurricane Georges in 1998. Whatever the final bill, Valentin just hopes it will factor in people like her. “If FEMA helps us, we are going to build again,” she said. ___ Associated Press photographer Gerald Herbert in Morovis contributed to this report.","https://apnews.com/134576eb8a1b40688fb6bf20aaa0da73/'Nothing,-nothing.'-Aid-lags-in-hurricane-torn-Puerto-Rico",AP,Neutral
Lengthy power restoration effort seen in Puerto Rico: U.S. power cos,Reuters Staff,9/27/17,"Puerto Rico faces a lengthy and complicated power restoration process after Hurricane Maria last week left the island’s 3. 4 million residents without electricity, according to a group of top U.S. electric company executives. Workers repairs electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin BaezThe CEOled Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) said in a release late on Tuesday that damage assessments must be completed to determine what human and equipment resources will be needed to restore power. Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane last Wednesday, with winds up to 155 miles (249 km) per hour, leveling structures across the island and killing at least 16 people. The ESCC is coordinating the restoration efforts between the U.S. government and the electric power sector. Its members include the American Public Power Association (APPA), which represents companies like the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which serves all 1. 5 million electrical customers on Puerto Rico. “We thank (U.S. ) President (Donald) Trump for authorizing 100percent cost sharing by the federal government for 180 days of emergency work to help begin the process of repairing damaged energy infrastructure,” said APPA President and Chief Executive Sue Kelly. The ESCC said the APPA and the electric power industry will work with government partners to secure the transportation, fuel, housing, food, water, and security that will be needed to support restoration crews once the assessments are done. “Responding to major events like Hurricane Maria requires significant coordination among the public and private sectors,” said Tom Fanning, an ESCC cochair. “Puerto Rico is facing complicated logistical challenges for life and safety that need to be stabilized before full power restoration efforts can get underway,” said Fanning, who is also the chairman, president and chief executive of Atlantabased Southern Co. The rates PREPA charged were not enough for the utility to maintain its infrastructure, in part due to ineffective collection efforts and longstanding mismanagement that had left it in a $9billion hole before declaring bankruptcy in July this year. PREPA’s equipment was already “degraded and unsafe,” according to a draft fiscal report the company filed in April.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-power-idUSKCN1C21SZ,Reuters,Neutral
"In storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, drinking water in short supply",Dave Graham,9/27/17,"A week after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, most of its 3. 4 million residents are scrambling to find clean water, with experts concerned about a looming public health crisis posed by the island’s damaged water system. A woman carries buckets to be filled with water from a tank truck at an area hit by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. Picture taken on September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia RawlinsOn Tuesday, hundreds of people crowded around a government water tanker in the northeastern municipality of Canovanas with containers of every size and shape after a wait that for many had lasted days. “This is the first tank they have brought here,” said Juan Cruz, a local carpenter, who was helping to fill the vessels while a solitary greenjacketed official stood by. “That is why the people are creating such a commotion, so they can survive. ”The U.S. territory’s water woes are tied to the collapse of its power grid; electricity is needed to pump, treat and filter water that shows up in household taps. With the grid incapacitated, dieselpowered generators are needed to clean and move water where it needs to go. But the island does not have nearly enough generators to perform this work, utility officials say, while fuel to run them is scarce. Only about 40 percent to 45 percent of the customers of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) had potable water as of Tuesday, company authorities said. Islandwide water service may not resume until electricity is restored across Puerto Rico, which could take months. In the meantime, officials are racing to deliver bottled water and send tanker trunks across the island, where desperation is growing. At the water line in Canovanas, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of the capital San Juan, people dunked bottles into larger containers still filling with water to make the most of their turn at the tanker. Others quenched their thirst straight away, draining their bottles, then refilling them. One woman carried four empty buckets that held about five gallons each. A few residents said they been without running water since about last Wednesday, when Maria knocked out electricity, phones and commerce around the island. Fallen trees and power lines have blocked roads. Many shops and supermarkets have remained closed, leaving residents with few places to buy water. Water service was spotty in San Juan, the island’s biggest city, while in places such as Toa Baja, about 25 miles west, people brought buckets and plastic trash cans to fill up at a water distribution station. Carlos Cotto, a government driver, 43, said he has been taking fiveliter containers every day to work from his home in Caguas to replenish them in San Juan, about 20 miles north, to help relatives whose water is now running low. “Just to keep the supply stable . . . so we have enough to survive on,” he said outside a large convention center that has been used to house people needing shelter from the storm. Slideshow ( 10 images )CONTAMINATION SEEPS INThe U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has provided more than 4 million meals and 6 million liters of water to Puerto Rico and the hurricanehit U.S. Virgin Islands, with an additional 7 million meals and 4 million liters of water en route by barge to the islands. “The vast majority of people on Puerto Rico do not have access to safe drinking water systems,” said Sven Rodenbeck, chief science officer for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hurricane response. He said the CDC is advising people in Puerto Rico to use bottled water as much as possible. “Whenever a water system, whether it is Puerto Rico or anywhere, loses pressure there is concern that bacterial contamination can be drawn into the drinking water system. That is why when you lose pressure you issue ‘boil water’ notices,” he said in a telephone interview. Even before the hurricane, Puerto Rico had a troubled water system. Virtually the entire population of Puerto Rico drew tap water in 2015 that violated federal rules set under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) said in a study released earlier this year. “Puerto Rico stood out for having the worst record of any territory or state in the U.S. in terms of drinking water contamination problems,” said Erik Olson, director of the Health Program at the Washington, D. C. based NRDC. The situation has only become worse with Maria, which has crippled sewage treatment plants and made the island’s already leaky pipes even more prone to contamination. With nothing coming out of the taps, people have turned to wells and springs, which presents another public health risk, Olson said. “That is shallow ground water that is incredibly susceptible to contamination from sewage and other sources,” he said. CLOSE TO DEFAULTThe water utility PRASA has also faced severe financial and regulatory problems. Last year, it entered into an agreement to plead guilty to an indictment charging 15 felony counts of violating the federal Clean Water Act through the illegal discharge of pollutants from nine sanitary wastewater treatment plants and five drinking water treatment plants, U.S. authorities said in December. PRASA last March said it had suspended ongoing projects and is considering other alternatives to pay off its contractors. A few days after the storm, ratings agency Fitch said stormrelated expenditures could compromise PRASA’s alreadystrained liquidity, driving it closer to default“With the systems that you have in Puerto Rico, you can make a lot of people sick very quickly,” the NRDC’s Olson said. But with no water in the taps and bottled water hard to come by, many Puerto Ricans don’t have the luxury of worrying about germs or illness. In a neighborhood near San Juan, rainwater that Angel Negroni and his wife collect in buckets for use in their garden has become the couple’s main source of water for drinking and cooking. Negroni, 72, said he figures they will not have water service or electricity restored for weeks. Until then, he said he plans to cook with a small gas burner set up under a covered porch. “I can make coffee,” Negroni said. “But pretty soon, I’ll need more bottled water. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-water/in-storm-ravaged-puerto-rico-drinking-water-in-short-supply-idINKCN1C21BS,Reuters,Neutral

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia RawlinsResidents and tourists were counting their dwindling banknotes in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which crippled the electrical grid and communications network, turning the Caribbean island into a largely cashbased economy. The New York branch of the U.S. central bank, which oversees and makes funds available to Puerto Rico’s financial institutions, said it was prepared for another surge in cash demand and could rush more banknotes to the island if necessary. ATMs are slowly reopening a week after Maria, the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in 90 years, caused widespread flooding and badly damaged homes, roads and other infrastructure on the island of 3. 4 million. The New York Fed’s cash distribution operations were working and it had adequate stocks to meet the needs of lenders and other firms on the U.S. territory, a spokeswoman told . “Demand for cash is extraordinarily high right now, and will evolve as depository institutions regain power, armored car services are able to reach branches, and ATMs are once again active,” the spokeswoman said. “‎We are coordinating with local and national authorities to monitor the situation on the ground very closely, and are actively preparing to meet any sustained elevated‎ currency demand in the future,” she added. “OUT OF OPTIONS”Cash is just one of the scarce resources on Puerto Rico, which faces shortages of fuel, water and medical supplies after Maria. With electricity and internet down in Yauco, southwestern Puerto Rico, Nancy and Caesar Nieve said they could not access paychecks directly deposited into their bank accounts. “What are we going to do when we don’t have any cash? The little cash we have, we have to save for gas,” said Nancy. Cash demand spiked in the first few days after the hurricane as merchants were unable to accept other modes of payment. First BanCorp FBP. N, one of the island's top banks, said around 28 of its 48 branches remained closed but electronic transactions were resuming and about 25 percent of its ATMs were back online as power and telecommunications were restored. “The first couple of days were a cash economy. Now electronic transactions are going through,” First BanCorp Chief Executive Aurelio Aleman said in a telephone interview, adding that the bank had enough cash on hand. The New York Fed boosted the island’s supply of banknotes before Maria arrived to meet a surge in demand. It ships cash directly from New York to a depot there from which private armored vehicles make deliveries. In the last month, Fed branches in Texas and Florida similarly stocked up on funds and ramped up deliveries in the face of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Isolation and widespread power outages, however, intensified the cash crunch in Puerto Rico. “I’m out of options,” said Brandon Alexander Jones, a vacationer from London who on Tuesday was down to $85, with no way to get more cash, and no way to reach a friend on the island due to crippled cellular service. He was staying in a San Juan shelter after a hobbled hotel had asked him and other guests to leave, and he spent much of his remaining money to get to the airport. “I don’t know how to get across the Atlantic. I don’t know how to get to the States. I’m stranded,” he told . “I’m out of reach from anyone who can help me. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-cash-idUSKCN1C22GJ,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico expects U.S. to lift Jones Act shipping restrictions,Reuters Staff,9/27/17,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Wednesday he expected the federal government to waive the Jones Act, which would lift restrictions on ships that can provide aid to the island devastated by Hurricane Maria. He said he has been speaking with members of Congress from both parties who have supported an emergency waiver. “We expect them to waive it,” Rossello said in an interview with CNN. He noted there was a sevenday waiver after Hurricane Irma, which was much less devastating to the island. On Tuesday, the Trump administration said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to stormravaged Puerto Rico, saying it would do nothing to address the island’s damaged ports, the main impediment to shipping. A waiver would allow Puerto Rico to get help not only from U.S. ships but from any ships that can bring aid. “That is critical, particularly for fuel,” he said. “One of the considerations right now is the priority of getting fuel, diesel, gasoline, all across the island. Right now we have enough fuel. We’re limited by the transportation logistics, but at some point of course, getting fuel into the island is going to be critical so that we can have the major functions of telecoms, hospitals, water, to be running appropriately. ”The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American ownedandoperated ships. U.S. Senator John McCain asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on Tuesday to grant an emergency waiver of the law. He said that Puerto Rican residents would have to pay at least twice as much for food, drinking water and other supplies without the waiver.

Puerto Rico emerges from storm; water and some food scarce,BEN FOX,9/26/17,"Supermarkets are gradually re-opening in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, but the situation is far from normal and many customers are going home disappointed. Most food stores and restaurants remain closed, largely because power is out for most of the island and few have generators or enough diesel to power them. The shops that were open Monday had long lines outside and vast empty shelves where they once held milk, meat and other perishables. Drinking water was nowhere to be found. Mercedes Caro shook her head in frustration as she emerged from the SuperMax in the Condado neighborhood of San Juan with a loaf of white bread, cheese and bananas. “There is no water and practically no food,” she said. “Not even spaghetti.” Maria Perez waited outside a Pueblo supermarket in a nearby part of San Juan, hoping to buy some coffee, sugar and maybe a little meat to cook with a gas stove that has enough propane for about another week. “We are in a crisis,” Perez said. “Puerto Rico is destroyed.” The fact that some stores and restaurants have re-opened for the first time since Category 4 Hurricane Maria roared across the island Sept. 20 is welcome in a place where nearly everyone has no power and more than half the people don’t have water. Gov. Ricardo Rossello and other Puerto Rican officials said some ports have been cleared by the Coast Guard to resume accepting ships, which should allow businesses to restock. But the situation remains far from normal. SuperMax opened on a reduced schedule for several stores in the San Juan area as well as in the hard-hit towns of Caguas and Dorado. Walgreens has reopened about half of its 120 locations in Puerto Rico on a limited basis. Walmart says it has a “handful” of its 48 stores and Sam’s Clubs open, but the process has been slowed by the power outages, port closures and the near total collapse of communications. Supermarket chain Econo opened 80 percent of its 63 stores across the island on Tuesday, though the hours would depend on the availability of diesel for its generators. Two Medinia supermarkets opened in the coastal town of Loiza. But Manager David Guzman said he had to impose restrictions on cooking gas and other products that were running low and might not be restocked soon. “We are restricting so we can give something to everyone, to extend what we have left,” he said. Therese Casper was among several dozen people waiting for a Walmart to open in the Santurce section of San Juan, but that didn’t happen Monday. She and her husband were looking for something to get rid of all the moisture that had accumulated in the apartment they rented three weeks ago when they moved to Puerto Rico from Denver, Colorado. They have been getting by in their dark, sweltering apartment on instant oatmeal and anything else they can cook on a propane stove as they wait for a flight back home. “I tell my husband it’s like camping. It’s ‘Survivor’ Puerto Rico,” Casper said. “It’s not what we bargained for.” Stores are still packed with dozens of brands of shampoo and other consumer products, but those aisles were largely empty as people rushed to buy the basics, using cash sparingly since that is also in short supply and credit card transactions aren’t being processed at all places. Ruth Calderon, a retiree, filled her basket with processed sausages that she planned to cook up with rice and share with an older neighbor who can’t leave her apartment. “I’m surviving,” she said with resignation. “I have what I need.” Others also described helping neighbors, and there are no signs of widespread hunger, at least not yet. “There is a tradition here of people helping each other, especially during disasters,” Doris Anglero said as she looked for what was available in an Old San Juan supermarket. Some disappointed shoppers were sharply aware that others on the island have it worse. Caro wept as she talked about her four grandchildren in Rincon, the western town that has been largely cut off from aid shipments as well as contact with the outside world. “Not knowing is so hard,” she said, turning to walk off. ___ Associated Press writer Chris Gillette contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-hurricanes-26175c2cb7154af3bbc909b3571d59fd,AP,Neutral
"Feds rush aid to Puerto Rico, while Trump tweets about debt",MICHAEL BIESECKER and ANDREW TAYLOR,9/26/17,"The U.S. ramped up its response Monday to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, even as President Donald Trump brought up the island’s struggles before Hurricane Maria struck — including “billions of dollars” in debt to “Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.” The Trump administration has tried to blunt criticism that its response to Hurricane Maria has fallen short of its efforts in Texas and Florida after the recent hurricanes there. Five days after the Category 4 storm slammed into Puerto Rico, many of the more than 3.4 million U.S. citizens in the territory were still without adequate food, water and fuel. Flights off the island were infrequent, communications were spotty and roads were clogged with debris. Officials said electrical power may not be fully restored for more than a month. Trump himself pointed out some differences between the two states and the island in a series of tweets Monday night. “Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.” Trump also noted that the island’s electrical grid was already “in terrible shape.” Still, he promised, “Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well.” In Washington, officials said no armada of U.S. Navy ships was headed to the island because supplies could be carried in more efficiently by plane. The Trump administration ruled out temporarily setting aside federal restrictions on foreign ships’ transportation of cargo, saying it wasn’t needed. The government had waived those rules in Florida and Texas until last week. Though the administration said the focus on aid was strong, when two Cabinet secretaries spoke at a conference on another subject — including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose agency is helping restore the island’s power — neither made any mention of Puerto Rico or Hurricane Maria. Democratic lawmakers with large Puerto Rican constituencies back on the mainland characterized the response so far as too little and too slow. The confirmed toll from Maria jumped to at least 49 on Monday, including 16 dead in Puerto Rico. “Puerto Ricans are Americans,” said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who traveled to Puerto Rico over the weekend to assess the damage. “We cannot and will not turn our backs on them.” Trump himself was expected at the end of last week to visit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, after they had been ravaged by Hurricane Irma. But the trip was delayed after Maria set its sights on the islands. The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, and White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert landed in San Juan on Monday, appearing with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello at a brief news briefing. Though Rossello had urgently called for more emergency assistance over the weekend, he expressed his gratitude for the help so far. The governor said the presence of Long and Bossert was “a clear indication that the administration is committed with Puerto Rico’s recovery process.” Long said, “We’ve got a lot of work to do. We realize that.” Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made no mention of Puerto Rico or the hurricane during a joint appearance before the National Petroleum Council, a business-friendly federal advisory committee. News reporters were not allowed to ask questions. Perry had traveled with Trump to Texas and Florida following hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Energy Department crews are working in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, coordinating with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, FEMA and a team from the New York Power Authority, among others. An eight-member team from the Western Area Power Authority, an Energy Department agency, assisted with initial damage assessments in Puerto Rico and has been redeployed to St. Thomas. A spokeswoman said additional responders would go to Puerto Rico as soon as transportation to the hurricane-ravaged island could be arranged. Zinke’s department oversees the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with other territories. The federal response to Maria faces obvious logistical challenges beyond those in Texas or Florida. Supplies must be delivered by air or sea, rather than with convoys of trucks. FEMA said it had more than 700 staff on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They were helping coordinate a federal response that now includes more than 10,000 federal personnel spread across the two Caribbean archipelagos. In Puerto Rico, federal workers supplied diesel to fuel generators at hospitals and delivered desperately needed food and water to hard-hit communities across the island. Cargo flights are bringing in additional supplies, and barges loaded with more goods are starting to arrive in the island’s ports. San Juan’s international airport handled nearly 100 arrivals and departures on Sunday, including military and relief operations, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Pentagon dispatched the Navy amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge, which provided helicopters and Marines to help with the relief effort onshore. However, the Trump administration said Monday it would not waive federal restrictions on foreign ships’ transportation of cargo as it had following Harvey and Irma. The administration said it will continue to enforce the Jones Act, which requires that goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flagged ships. Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan said the agency had concluded there were already enough US-flagged vessels available. On Capitol Hill, congressional leaders were talking about how to pay for it all. Puerto Rico was already struggling from steep financial and economic challenges before Maria made landfall. Last year, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi joined with President Barack Obama to help recession-ravaged Puerto Rico deal with its debt crisis. After the devastating storm, Puerto Ricans will now be eligible to benefit from the same pots of federal emergency disaster aid and rebuilding funds available to residents in Texas and Florida. Lawmakers approved a $15 billion hurricane relief packaged after Harvey hit Texas, but billions more will likely now be needed to respond to Maria. Ryan said Monday that Congress will ensure the people of Puerto Rico “have what they need.” ___ Associated Press reporters Ben Fox in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Jill Colvin, Robert Burns, Matthew Daly, Joan Lowy and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed. ___ Follow Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck","https://apnews.com/f4ea5dfae25c4d87b9278a6077bbfe13/Feds-rush-aid-to-Puerto-Rico,-while-Trump-tweets-about-debt",AP,Neutral
Power blackout leaves darkened Puerto Rico isolated and paralyzed,Robin Respaut,9/26/17,"Broken electricity poles and streetlights list into the middle of highways. Satellite images show an island devoid of light. Cellular phone service is nonexistent. FILE PHOTO: A worker uses a backhoe loader to remove damaged electrical installations from a street after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico on September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File PhotoHurricane Maria’s devastation of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico last week left the entire island and its 3. 4 million residents without power. Officials are still evaluating what is needed to kick off a monthslong effort to bring back electricity, meaning millions of people could face an extended period without clean water, refrigeration, safe food or medical supplies. A full damage assessment by Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has been difficult because of the limited ability to get flights to the island and federal agencies concentrating on saving lives and providing power to crucial infrastructure like hospitals. “They should be complete with their initial damage assessment in days or maybe a week ,not weeks or months,” said Gil Quiniones, president of New York Power Authority (NYPA), who traveled with New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo to the island on Friday. Quiniones, who took a team of 10 from the stateowned NYPA with him, said power generation damage has been minimal, but transmission and distribution lines have been hit with “extensive” damage. Fixing those lines will be an extended process, so many will be relying on diesel and gasoline during that time. Maria struck Puerto Rico as a very dangerous Category 4 hurricane on Wednesday, with winds up to 155 miles per hour (249 km per hour), leveling structures across large swathes of the island, killing at least 10 residents and cutting off power and telecommunications services. Highway signs and traffic poles were scattered across highways around the island on Tuesday, with intersections turned into obstacle courses as cars drove over and around tangled wires and other debris. Broken transmission towers ,heavy steel structures up to 150 feet (46 meters) tall that support highvoltage wires ,were visible. Unlike Hurricane Irma a week earlier, where tens of thousands of utility workers streamed into Florida shortly after that storm swept through the state, those determining the extent of the damage to Puerto Rico’s degraded electrical grid were only starting to get the full measure of the destruction. Rebuilding will be a challenging task for PREPA, which declared bankruptcy in July and is regularly criticized by residents for frequent outages and rates higher than every U.S. state other than Hawaii. About 55 percent of the island’s transmission towers have been destroyed, according to industry group the American Public Power Association (APPA), which is working with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency on relief efforts. Slideshow ( 2 images )About 90 percent of the distribution network, which brings power to residents and businesses, is out of commission, APPA said. Nighttime satellite images released by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed the island early on Monday almost entirely without light. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Monday that 91 percent of cellular sites in Puerto Rico remain out of service. Outside San Juan, the capital, cell service was virtually nonexistent, and residents said they have been unable to communicate with relatives and friends, be they distant or merely just in another part of the island. CREWS, EQUIPMENTQuiniones said it was difficult to send assistance teams of utility workers that usually swarm into a region hit by bad weather because Puerto Rico is an island. At the moment, NYPA is not sending additional people beyond those helping to appraise the damages. Quiniones said PREPA needed first to work out what resources it needed to rebuild the grid. “They need to complete the damage assessment first,” he said. “They have to be able to plan and prioritize the work. ”The rates PREPA charges were not enough for the utility to maintain its infrastructure, in part due to ineffective collection efforts, and longstanding mismanagement that had left it in a $9billion hole before declaring bankruptcy in July this year. “The country is likely going to be without power for months,” said Ismael Perez, an engineer and resident. The national utility needs to be depoliticized or privatized, he said. PREPA’s equipment was already “degraded and unsafe,” according to a draft fiscal report the utility filed in April. The collapse of power could in fact accelerate PREPA’s restructuring effort, a source familiar with the bankruptcy said, as it would put the system on a more stable footing. The damage would motivate creditors to resolve the bankruptcy due to investments needed to restore power, said Matt Fabian, municipal debt analyst at MMA Inc: “It doesn’t make a lot of sense to spend a billion dollars restoring damaged generation facilities that are about to be replaced. ”(For a graphic on Power Restoration After Major U.S. Hurricanes, click tmsnrt. rs/2xvCFyU)",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-power-idUSKCN1C10FA,Reuters,Neutral
"Trump praises disaster relief in Puerto Rico, discounting complaints",Robin Respaut,9/26/17,"U.S. President Donald Trump praised his administration on Tuesday for “doing a really good job” with disaster relief for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, discounting complaints that aid has been slow to reach the U.S. island territory. GM invests $7 billion to rival EV competitors Trump says will visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday, promises to help01:38Trump agreed to boost federal disaster assistance, ordering increased funding be made available to assist with debris removal and emergency protective measures. He also said he would pay a visit on Oct. 3 to Puerto Rico, as well as to the U.S. Virgin Islands, a neighboring Caribbean territory struggling to recover from two major hurricanes in a single month. Democratic leaders in Congress and some residents in Puerto Rico have accused the Republican administration of being more sluggish in its response than it would to a disaster on the U.S. mainland, even though Puerto Rico’s 3. 4 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens. The criticism was heightened by a series of Twitter messages by Trump on Monday about hurricane damage on Puerto Rico in which he also referred to the island’s $72 billion debt crisis and bankruptcy. “Much of the Island has been destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with,” he tweeted. Maria roared ashore Puerto Rico last Wednesday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the island in nearly a century, knocking out the territory’s entire electrical grid, unleashing severe flooding and causing widespread heavy damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm has claimed more than 30 lives across the Caribbean, including at least 15 in Puerto Rico. It was the third major hurricane to hit the United States in less than a month, following Harvey in Texas and Irma, which ranked as the most powerful Atlantic storm on record before thrashing several Caribbean islands and Florida. Maria was downgraded to a tropical storm on Tuesday, far off the coast of North Carolina. “We’ve gotten Apluses on Texas and in Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico,” Trump told reporters in Washington. “The difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. It’s a big ocean, it’s a very big ocean. And we’re doing a really good job. ”Related CoverageIn stormravaged Puerto Rico, drinking water in short supplyPuerto Rican government capacity 'severely diminished:' U.S. officialSee more storiesTrump visited Texas and Florida after Harvey and Irma. The last Republican president, George W. Bush, faced widespread criticism for his administration’s handling of Hurricane Katrina, which killed some 1,800 people in and around New Orleans in 2005. Bush faced particular ire for saying, at a time when the Federal Emergency Management Agency was widely seen as having fallen short in its response, that the thenFEMA head, Michael Brown, was doing a “heckuva job. ”Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the island needed 1,000 to 1,500 additional security personnel and at least another 200 generators, as well as fuel for them. He urged Trump to propose an aid package to Congress in the next day or two. “With all due respect, President Trump, relief efforts are not ‘doing well,’” Schumer said. ‘NOT PENNYPINCHING’White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney countered that U.S. disasterrelief spending sufficient to last through midOctober has been appropriated. “We are picking up most of the cost right now in Puerto Rico,” he told reporters in Cleveland. “We are not pennypinching in any fashion. We are taking care of folks. ”The administration has about $5 billion remaining in a disaster relief fund, and Congress has already approved another $7 billion in funding that will become available on Oct. 1, according to a House Appropriations Committee aide. A badly damaged neighborhood in St. Croix. REUTERS/Jonathan DrakeSix days after the storm hit, much of the island remains inaccessible, communication is difficult and fuel is in short supply. U.S. Air Force Colonel Michael Valle, helping with the relief effort, said supplies have been flowing into the island at the rate of one airplane load per hour since Friday, but distribution remained a problem. “The extent of the damage in the center of the island is not known yet because there are still a lot of roads that are impassable,” he said in San Juan, the capital. About 44 percent of Puerto Rico’s population currently lacks access to clean drinking water, and the majority of the island’s 69 hospitals are without electricity or fuel needed for generators, the U.S. Defense Department said. FEMA said that 7 million meals and 4 million liters of water were en route to the island by barge. The agency had previously shipped more than 4 million meals and 6 million liters of water to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, it said. FEMA also has opened distribution centers in 12 cities in Puerto Rico and at 12 locations in the Virgin Islands to provide food, water and other commodities, the agency said. Still, many residents were struggling to get basic essentials. “We’ve not seen any help. Nobody’s been out asking what we need or that kind of thing,” said Maria Gonzalez, 74, in the Santurce district of San Juan. Help appeared to be reaching parts of the city, she said, pointing to Condado, a tourist area powered by generators while other San Juan streets fall into darkness at dusk. “There’s plenty of electricity over there, but there’s nothing in the poor areas,” Gonzalez said. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz strongly criticized Trump for focusing on the island’s financial woes in his tweets. “You don’t put debt above people, you put people above debt,” she told CNN. Officials were still taking stock of what was expected to be a monthslong effort to rebuild the island’s power system, and many residents seemed resigned to a long wait for basic services to return. But few doubted the U.S. government had the ability to bring the island back to its feet quickly. “If they wanted to fix things fast, they could do it,” said Carlos Arias, 41, as he waited in a line of people snaking around a block in San Juan to fill up a canister with gasoline. “It’s a question of will. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-idUSKCN1C11ZP,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. says no need for Puerto Rico shipping waiver,Timothy Gardner,9/26/17,"The Trump administration on Tuesday said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to stormravaged Puerto Rico, because it would do nothing to address the island’s main impediment to shipping, damaged ports. The Jones Act limits shipping between coasts to U.S. flagged vessels. However, in the wake of brutal storms, the government has occasionally issued temporary waivers to allow the use of cheaper, tax free or more readily available foreignflagged ships. The Department of Homeland Security, which waived the act after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, did not agree an exemption would help this time. On Monday, U.S. Representative Nydia Velázquez and seven other representatives asked Elaine Duke, acting head of Homeland Security, to waive the nearly 100yearold shipping law for a year to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria. Gregory Moore, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, an office of Homeland Security, said in a statement that an assessment by the agency showed there was “sufficient capacity” of U.S. flagged vessels to move commodities to Puerto Rico. “The limitation is going to be port capacity to offload and transit, not vessel availability,” Moore said. Puerto Rico has long railed against the Jones Act, saying it makes the cost of imported basic commodities, such as food, clothing and fuel, more expensive. After Homeland’s assessment, Senator John McCain, a Republican and a long time opponent of the Jones Act, sent a letter to Duke asking why the administration opposes a waiver. He asked the department to detail the costs of shipping goods from Florida to Puerto Rico versus the costs of shipping from Florida to the Virgin Islands, which has a permanent Jones Act exemption. “It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster,” McCain said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by . The administration’s rationale for a waiver after Harvey and Irma hit Texas, Louisiana and Florida was to ease movement of fuel to places along the U.S. East Coast and make up for temporary outages of highcapacity pipelines. “The situation in Puerto Rico is much different,” Moore said in the statement, adding that most of the humanitarian effort would be carried out with barges, which make up a large portion of the U.S. flagged cargo fleet. Homeland did not immediately return a request for comment on the McCain letter. Backers of a Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico said it would help the relief effort. “Our dependence on fossil fuel imports by sea is hampering the restoration of services,” said Juan DecletBarreto, an energy expert at the nonprofit group the Union of Concerned Scientists. The administration’s opposition to a waiver “is raising fears on the island that they are going to be left behind in this disaster. ”The United States shipped an average of nearly 770,000 barrels of crude oil and oil products like gasoline and diesel annually to Puerto Rico from 2012 to 2016. Supporters of the Jones Act, including ship builders, have said it supports American jobs, including ones in Puerto Rico and keeps shipping routes reliable.

Puerto Rico is in the dark in wake of Hurricane Maria,DANICA COTO and DAVID KOENIG,9/25/17,"Every night since Hurricane Maria hit, Miguel Martinez and his family have slept on mattresses on the porch to escape the heat inside their dark, stifling home. But it’s nearly impossible to sleep with temperatures in the mid-80s. At least once a night they climb to the roof to catch a hint of breeze. Then the 51-year-old construction worker, his three children and one grandchild climb back down again. “It’s a heat from hell,” Martinez said. “We don’t have a generator or a fan. We have nothing.  The children get desperate. You want just a little bit of cold water, but there’s none.” The power is still out across nearly all of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria smashed poles, snarled power lines and flooded electricity-generating plants last Wednesday, knocking out a grid that was already considered antiquated compared to the U.S. mainland. Generators are providing power to the fortunate few who have them, but nearly all the island’s 1.6 million electricity customers were still without power Monday and facing many, many hot days and dark nights to come. Power had been restored to a handful of hospitals and surrounding areas by Monday afternoon but Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario said it will take months to fully restore power to the island. Authorities are still figuring out the extent of the damage, let alone beginning to repair it. Utility workers from New York have arrived to help assess the damage, while airplanes and barges are bringing in more generators. Getting the power back isn’t just a matter of comfort. A long delay will mean even more pain for a Puerto Rican economy that’s already reeling from a decade-long recession. With no power, even more people will leave the island to find better opportunities on the mainland and further drain its workforce. The downed power system is also damaging the tourism industry, which contributed 8 percent to Puerto Rico’s economy last year. The overwhelming smell of rotting garbage wafted through a working-class part of the Santurce section of San Juan, where 46-year-old construction worker Rafael Santana spent the night in front of a single fan thanks to a neighbor with a generator who was kind enough to throw over a cable so he could have power from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. By 8 a.m., Santana’s forehead was beaded with sweat as he left home to seek out some shade nearby. Roberto Ruiz, a 50-year-old handyman, handed a chilled bottle of water that his daughter brought home from her job, which has power, to a neighbor seeking something to drink. “Look at this! Cold water!” exclaimed 70-year-old Jose Luis Burgos as he took the bottle and looked at it, mesmerized. “We are suffering here.” Ruiz said he jumps into the shower several times a day to cool off, letting water drip over his body instead of drying off afterward. He also leaves his windows open, which led to another problem: “Now the mosquitoes don’t leave me alone.” Most people have thrown open their doors and windows, anxious to feel a breeze amid the oppressive heat. Six-month-old Rafshliany Cortijo wore only diapers as she sat in a swing placed in an open doorway. She smiled as she slowly swung back and forth. “I bathe her six times a day,” said Franchesca Rivera, the baby’s 31-year-old mother. “She sweats a lot.” Mother and daughter sleep on the porch at night along with Rivera’s son to stave off the heat since they don’t have a generator or a battery-powered fan. Nelida Morales, a 49-year-old nanny, said her house becomes an oven during the day because three big trees that once shaded it were uprooted by the storm. “We can’t go to the rivers because of floodwaters. And the beach is out of reach,” Morales said as sweat beaded on her upper lip. Puerto Rico’s power plants were not severely damaged, according to Gov. Ricardo Rossello. However, 80 percent of the island’s transmission lines are down, and Rossello said it would take up to two years to completely rebuild the infrastructure under normal conditions. He said the plan is to restore power with some quick fixes to the network and then gradually strengthen it to avoid problems like blackouts and make it less vulnerable to future storms. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, has more than 2,400 miles of major transmission lines and more than 30,000 miles of smaller distribution wires that connect homes and businesses to the grid. Much of the network is down. Officials hoped to use helicopters and drones to get a better look and help them decide where to send repair crews first. Unlike Texas and Florida, where Hurricanes Harvey and Irma knocked out power grids this summer, workers from other utilities on the U.S. mainland can’t hop in trucks and drive to Puerto Rico. By Monday afternoon the main airport in San Juan was not yet operating normally, which is slowing the airlift of crews, generators and other equipment. Even before Maria hit, the power authority said it needed more than $4 billion to upgrade its infrastructure after years of under-investment left it with an inefficient and unreliable system. Its fleet of power plants has a median age of 44 years; the average age across the United States is 18 years. The power authority already had more than $9 billion in debt when it filed for what is essentially bankruptcy protection in July. It was weakened by the island’s long recession, which sapped demand for electricity, but it also struggled to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills. Last year, consultants hired by the Puerto Rico Energy Commission wrote a scathing report about the  power authority, noting that outages occurred four or five times more often than at mainland U.S. utilities because of a history of neglecting maintenance. “It is difficult to overstate the level of disrepair or operational neglect at PREPA’s generation facilities,” wrote consultants from Synapse Energy Economics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They said that frequently there were “simple failures that blossom into crises.” ___ Associated Press writer Danica Coto reported this story in San Juan and AP writer  David Koenig reported from Dallas. ___ Danico Coto on Twitter: https://twitter.com/danicacoto David Koenig on Twitter: https://twitter.com/airlinewriter",https://apnews.com/39f0cf37e06b47e986134e8e51315268/Puerto-Rico-is-in-the-dark-in-wake-of-Hurricane-Maria,AP,Neutral
"Trump says Puerto Rico in trouble after hurricane, debt 'must be dealt with'",Reuters Staff,9/25/17,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday Puerto Rico is in “deep trouble” after being hit by Hurricane Maria and that its billions of dollars of debt to the Wall Street and banks “must be dealt with. ”“Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,” Trump wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. “It’s (sic) old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. ”Trump did not offer a pathway for dealing with Puerto Rico’s debt. The U.S. territory, struggling with $72 billion in debt, filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history earlier this year. Maria, the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century, devastated the Caribbean island when it struck the U.S. territory with ferocious winds and torrential rains last week. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday asked for more government aid to avert a humanitarian crisis in the island, which is home to 3. 4 million people. Puerto Rico’s government on Monday asked a judge for up to four extra weeks to meet key deadlines in its bankruptcy case after Hurricane Maria brought its fragile infrastructure to its knees. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters in Washington that the administration was engaged in a factfinding process to figure out how much help Puerto Rico needs.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-trump-idUSKCN1C103Z,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico's fragile economy dealt new blow by Maria,Dave Graham,9/25/17,"Chan Lo is racing against the clock to save thousands of dollars of supplies at his sushi restaurant in San Juan’s Condado beachfront community. He has roughly $16,000worth of perishable goods stored in his restaurant Nagoya Sushi & Tiki Bar ,in jeopardy as the battered island waits for power and water to be reestablished. “I give it about three or four days maximum if the (power) doesn’t come back on and there are no generators available,” he said. “Everything will have to be thrown out. ”Puerto Rico’s economy was already fragile before Hurricane Maria barreled into the island, but the strongest storm to hit the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years could inflict heavy damage on the island’s health. Small businesses like Lo’s will be a significant part of the recovery, as they account for 80 percent of all private sector workers, according to a New York Federal Reserve report. And getting energy to them, and to manufacturers and hotels and other engines of the economy will be crucial for the island’s ability to bounce back. After Maria made landfall midweek on the island of 3. 4 million people as a major Category 4 hurricane, the storm’s wind and water downed nearly all power and communications. Governor Ricardo Rossello said the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s grid was so severely hit by the storm that it could be months before electricity is restored to all customers. Making matters worse, PREPA has been in bankruptcy since July. Disaster modeler Enki Research estimates damage to the island at $30 billion, with $20 billion in direct physical damage and $10 billion in economic impact. “Puerto Rico is in a precarious state,” said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki. ‘A MEASURABLE IMPACT’Puerto Rico has none of the economic might of other places hit hard in this active hurricane season, like the states of Texas and Florida. The island has spent most of the last ten years in recession. Its GDP shrank by more than one percent for seven of the last 10 years through 2016, the poverty rate is over 40 percent and unemployment stands at 10 percent. The chaos unleashed by the breakdown in basic services, a lack of cash and gas shortages has put many businesses into limbo, and the shortterm effects are likely to be severe. Some Puerto Ricans are, however, already looking ahead to the economic boost that could be delivered by investment in the recovery. The timeliness of U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds will play into how quickly Puerto Rico gets back on its feet, said S&P Global Ratings analyst David Hitchcock. Meanwhile, the hurricane has pushed back the island’s bankruptcy process. Struggling under $72 billion in debt, Puerto Rico filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history earlier this year but that is now on the backburner, sources said on Thursday. “This is an island that has been riddled with bad news,” said Jonathan Mondillo, Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, which holds insured Puerto Rican bonds. “It’s going to have a measurable impact on their economy locally. ”MANUFACTURING HEARTIn the aftermath of the storm, businesses both big and small around the island were assessing the damage and putting contingency plans in place. Puerto Rico boasts investments from a number of U.S. multinationals, such as WalMart, Amgen and Eli Lilly. A spokesman for Honeywell International Inc, said the company’s “folks on the ground are making sure everyone’s accounted for and what their needs are . . . we’re still assessing the facilities. ”Manufacturing is still the heart of Puerto Rico’s economy and any blow to industry could have a significant impact. It makes up nearly 49 percent of the island’s GDP, according to a 2015 report from the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association. But the manufacturing sector is much diminished after the U.S. Congress decided to gradually phase out a 1976 tax credit program. That program ended in 2006, after which many companies left and the island had lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs by 2014. HIT TO GROWING TOURISMJust as concerning to the island is likely to be the impact Hurricane Maria has caused to tourism ,which will be especially hard felt since it was one area of the economy that had been growing. Travel and tourism had grown from 7. 3 percent of GDP in 2014 to an estimated 8. 4 percent in 2017 and was projected to rise to 10. 7 percent by 2027, including direct and indirect spending, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Hotels and resorts were struggling to stay open in the days after the hit. Reynaldo Rey, general manager of the AC Hotel San Juan, said businesses were facing a race against the clock if emergency power supplies and water ran out because generators would only keep hotels operating for a few days. “Everything depends on when the supply lines are reestablished,” Rey said. “We risk a complete shutdown. ”Raul Brito, 24, a security guard for the state tourism agency in the capital’s upscale Condado neighborhood, said business was now in limbo at the worst time possible. “Companies don’t know if they are going to be able to start up again because they don’t know yet if they will have the money,” he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-storm-maria-puertorico-idUSKCN1C01FT,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico evacuates area near crumbling dam, asks for aid",Dave Graham,9/25/17,"Many people living near a crumbling dam in stormbattered Puerto Rico have evacuated, Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Monday, as he asked for more government aid to avert a humanitarian crisis after Hurricane Maria. An aerial view shows the damage to the Guajataca dam. REUTERS/Alvin BaezMuch of the Caribbean island, a U.S. territory with a population of 3. 4 million, is still without electricity five days after Maria struck with ferocious winds and torrential rains, the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century. There have been growing concerns for some 70,000 people who live in the river valley below the Guajataca Dam in the island’s northwest, where cracks were seen on Friday in the 88yearold earthen structure. Rossello said he was working on the assumption that the 120foot (35meter) dam would collapse. “I’d rather be wrong on that front than doing nothing and having that fail and costing people lives,” he said in an interview with CNN. “Most of the people in the near vicinity have evacuated. ”It was unclear if the governor was saying that most of the 70,000 valley inhabitants had left the area, or only the several hundred people living in the small towns closest to the dam. About 320 people from those towns have moved to safety, according to local media. The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the immense task facing disaster relief authorities after Maria, which was the second major hurricane to strike the Caribbean this month. The storm killed at least 29 people in the region, at least 10 of those in Puerto Rico, which was already battling an economic crisis. Rossello said that before the storms struck, he had been embarking on an aggressive fiscal agenda that included more than $1. 5 billion in cuts. “This is a game changer,” he told CNN. “This is a completely different set of circumstances. This needs to be taken into consideration otherwise there will be a humanitarian crisis. ”Related CoverageTrump says Puerto Rico in trouble after hurricane, debt 'must be dealt with'Couple defy Hurricane Maria on roof to save pets ,lots of themSee more stories‘UNPRECEDENTED PUSH’Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Tom Bossert, senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security, met with Rossello on Monday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters in Washington that the administration was engaged in a factfinding process to figure out how much help Puerto Rico needs. “The federal response has been anything but slow,” Sanders said at the daily briefing. “In fact, there’s been an unprecedented push through of billions of dollars in federal assistance that the administration has fought for. ”Many structures on Puerto Rico, including hospitals, remain badly damaged and flooded, with clean drinking water hard to find in some areas. Few planes have been able to land or take off from damaged airports. The storm has also put a big strain on PREPA, the island’s electricity utility, which declared bankruptcy in July after accumulating a $9 billion debt and years of underinvestment. From preliminary FEMA reports, it is estimated that 55 percent of transmission towers may be down, and that more than 90 percent of the distribution system could have been destroyed. More than 91 percent of Puerto Rico’s cellphone sites are also out of service, the Federal Communications Commission said. Slideshow ( 15 images )There are more than 10,000 federal staff, including more than 700 people from FEMA, doing recovery work in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to FEMA. The National Weather Service warned of further flash floods in the west of the island on Monday as thunderstorms moved in. Maria would likely be downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on Tuesday night, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 2 p. m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Monday, the center said, it was about 300 miles (480 km) southsoutheast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, heading slowly north. The storm was unlikely to hit the continental United States directly, but the NHC said large swells were affecting the U.S. East Coast. A tropical storm warning was in effect for much of the North Carolina coast and officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for visitors to Ocracoke Island in the Outer Banks that went into effect at 5 a. m.

Travelers swamp Puerto Rico's main airport; dam on verge of collapse,Dave Graham,9/25/17,"Hundreds of stranded travelers filled the sweltering halls of San Juan International Airport on Monday anxious to know when they could leave and reconnect with families after Hurricane Maria devastated power and communications across the island. An aerial view shows the damage to the Guajataca dam. REUTERS/Alvin BaezFearful of checking out of hotels in case they could not get on the few flights available, worried passengers waited in long lines at Puerto Rico’s main airport, struggling to get through to loved ones and airlines alike. “Everything is hearsay at the moment because there is no communication,” said 31yearold Rene Kessler, a medical student from Baltimore, Maryland, preparing to spend the night in the airport ahead of what he hoped would be a flight back to the United States. Puerto Rican officials have confirmed at least 10 stormrelated fatalities on the island, and the hurricane was blamed for at least 19 other deaths across the Caribbean, the bulk of them on the devastated island nation of Dominica. A microcosm of the battered island, the San Juan airport is a top priority in efforts by Puerto Rico’s cashstrapped government to repair the vast damage caused by Maria. Experts say the work will take months and likely run into tens of billions of dollars. Closed for days following the storm, the airport is a major test of Puerto Rico’s ability to transport people and supplies and overcome the communications vacuum that has plagued the island since the storm. María has also turned Puerto Rico, a haven for Caribbean islanders left homeless by Hurricane Irma earlier this month, into a disaster zone with virtually no power that many are now desperate to escape. A dam on the island has weakened by heavy rains from Hurricane Maria was in danger of failing, posing a flood threat to thousands of homes downstream. Some 70,000 people who inhabit a river valley below the Guajataca Dam in the northwestern corner of the island have been under evacuation since Friday after authorities warned the structure was in danger of imminent collapse. The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the extreme difficulties facing disaster relief authorities in the aftermath of Maria, which has claimed at least 29 lives across the Caribbean, according to officials and media reports. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello urged residents of the area to evacuate after surveying damage to the dam over the weekend, telling reporters that a fissure in the structure “has become a significant rupture. ”Slideshow ( 7 images )The National Weather Service in San Juan, the island’s capital, on Monday continued a flood warning for western Puerto Rico. Maria, the second major hurricane to savage the Caribbean this month and the most powerful to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction through the island after plowing ashore early on Wednesday. ‘WE LOST EVERYTHING’“We lost our house, it was completely flooded,” said resident Carmen Gloria Lamb, a resident near the rainswollen Guajataca. “We lost everything. Cars, clothes, everything. ”Severe flooding, structural damage to homes and the loss of all electricity, except from backup generators, were three of the most pressing problems facing Puerto Ricans, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said during a tour of the island. New York is home to many of Puerto Rican descent. “It’s a terrible immediate situation that requires assistance from the federal government, not just financial assistance,” he said on CNN on Saturday. Even the island’s medical facilities have been left in precarious shape, with many hospitals flooded, strewn with rubble and running critically low on diesel fuel needed to keep generators operating. Evacuation to the U.S. mainland is the only option for some patients. The storm has caused an estimated $45 billion of damage and lost economic activity across the Caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in Puerto Rico, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-idUSKCN1C01TJ,Reuters,Neutral
Official: Hurricane Maria set Puerto Rico back decades,DANICA COTO,9/24/17,"Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress said Sunday that Hurricane Maria’s destruction has set the island back decades, even as authorities worked to assess the extent of the damage. “The devastation in Puerto Rico has set us back nearly 20 to 30 years,” said Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez. “I can’t deny that the Puerto Rico of now is different from that of a week ago. The destruction of properties, of flattened structures, of families without homes, of debris everywhere. The island’s greenery is gone.” Engineers on Sunday planned to inspect the roughly 90-year-old Guajataca Dam, which holds back a reservoir covering about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) in northwest Puerto Rico. The government said it suffered a large crack after Maria dumped 15 inches (nearly 40 centimeters) of rain on the surrounding mountains and that it “will collapse at any minute.” Nearby residents had been evacuated, but began returning to their homes Saturday after a spillway eased pressure on the dam. Puerto Rico’s National Guard diverted an oil tanker that broke free and threatened to crash into the southeast coast, said Gov. Ricardo Rossello, and officials still had not had communication with nine of 78 municipalities. “This is a major disaster,” he said. “We’ve had extensive damage. This is going to take some time.” The death toll from Maria in Puerto Rico was at least 10, including two police officers who drowned in floodwaters in the western town of Aguada. That number was expected to climb as officials from remote towns continued to check in with officials in San Juan. Authorities in the town of Vega Alta on the north coast said they had been unable to reach an entire neighborhood called Fatima, and were particularly worried about residents of a nursing home. Across the Caribbean, Maria had claimed at least 31 lives, including at least 15 on hard-hit Dominica. Mike Hyland, a spokesman for the American Public Power Association, which represents the Puerto Rican power agency, said Sunday that restoration is a long ways off. The organization is working with U.S. Energy Department crews as well as New York Power Authority workers sent down by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to fly over the island and assess damage. Crews hoped to get helicopters and drones in the air over the next two days to assess the damage, but Hyland said they need to be patient and let the military continue rescuing people before focusing on restoring power. “We are trying to get an understanding of the extent of the damage over the next 48 hours to then begin to work with our federal partners to get the right crews and equipment down to Puerto Rico,” Hyland said. Large amounts of federal aid have begun moving into Puerto Rico, welcomed by local officials who praised the Trump administration’s response but called for the emergency loosening of rules long blamed for condemning the U.S. territory to second-class status. The opening of the island’s main port in the capital allowed 11 ships to bring in 1.6 million gallons of water, 23,000 cots, dozens of generators and food. Dozens more shipments are expected in upcoming days. The federal aid effort is racing to stem a growing humanitarian crisis in towns left without fresh water, fuel, electricity or phone service. Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is in charge of the relief effort, said they would take satellite phones to all of Puerto Rico’s towns and cities, more than half of which were cut off following Maria’s devastating crossing of Puerto Rico on Wednesday. The island’s infrastructure was in sorry shape long before Maria struck. A $73 billion debt crisis has left agencies like the state power company broke. As a result the power company abandoned most basic maintenance in recent years, leaving the island subject to regular blackouts. A federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances authorized up to $1 billion in local funds to be used for hurricane response, but the governor said he would ask for more. “We’re going to request waivers and other mechanisms so Puerto Rico can respond to this crisis,” Rossello said. “Puerto Rico will practically collect no taxes in the next month.” U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York said she will request a one-year waiver from the Jones Act, a federal law blamed for driving up prices on Puerto Rico by requiring cargo shipments there to move only on U.S. vessels as a means of supporting the U.S. maritime industry. “We will use all our resources,” Velazquez said. “We need to make Puerto Rico whole again. These are American citizens.” A group of anxious mayors traveled to the capital to meet with Rossello to present a long list of items they urgently need. The north coastal town of Manati had run out of fuel and fresh water, Mayor Jose Sanchez Gonzalez said. “Hysteria is starting to spread. The hospital is about to collapse. It’s at capacity,” he said, crying. “We need someone to help us immediately.” Across Puerto Rico, more than 15,000 people were in shelters, including some 2,000 rescued from the north coastal town of Toa Baja. Many Puerto Ricans planned to head to the mainland to temporarily escape the devastation. ___ AP reporter Christopher Gillette contributed from Guajataca, Puerto Rico.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-251a47c7bbec4c11b82e21edcdf47316,AP,Neutral

The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the pandemonium facing disaster relief authorities in the aftermath of Maria, which has claimed at least 29 lives across the Caribbean, according to officials and media reports. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello personally urged residents of the area to heed evacuation orders after surveying damage to the dam on Saturday, telling reporters that a fissure in the structure “has become a significant rupture. ”The dam, which stands about 120 feet (37 meters) tall, was built in 1929 and supplies the surrounding region with hydropower, drinking water and irrigation supplies. The National Weather Service in San Juan, the island’s capital, extended a flash flood watch for communities along the rainswollen Guajataca River below the dam through midday Sunday. If the dam were to fail, flooding would be lifethreatening, the Weather Service warned. “Stay away or be swept away,” it said. Maria, the second major hurricane to savage the Caribbean this month and the most powerful to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction through the island after plowing ashore early on Wednesday. Arriving as a Category 4 storm on the SaffirSimpson wind scale, with top winds of up to 155 mph (249. 5 kph), Maria ripped roofs from buildings, turned roads into gushing debrisstrewn rivers and knocked out power across the entire island, home to 3. 4 million people.

Drivers had to wait up to seven hours at the few filling stations open on Saturday, according to news reports. Water rationing also began on Saturday. Signs posted throughout San Juan’s Old Town informed residents that service would return for two hours until further notice. Slideshow ( 10 images )Telephone service also was unreliable, with many of the island’s cell towers damaged or destroyed. On Sunday morning, the governor told reporters that officials would continue to clear roads and bridges blocked by the storm and that he would be joining a supply delivery mission to Caguas, a small city in the mountains south of San Juan. The storm caused an estimated $45 billion of damage and lost economic activity across the Caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in Puerto Rico, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia. Maria, which was hundreds of miles (km) east of Florida over the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm and was expected to weaken further as it moves north in the Atlantic off the East Coast over the next two days.

Dam failing as scope of Puerto Rico’s disaster becomes clear,DANICA COTO,9/23/17,"Puerto Rican officials rushed to evacuate tens of thousands of people downstream of a failing dam and said they could not reach more than half the towns in the U.S. territory as the massive scale of the disaster wrought by Hurricane Maria started to become clear on Friday. Government spokesman Carlos Bermudez said that officials had no communication with 40 of the 78 municipalities on the island more than two days after the Category 4 storm crossed the island, toppling power lines and cellphone towers and sending floodwaters cascading through city streets. Officials said 1,360 of the island’s 1,600 cellphone towers had been downed, and 85 percent of above-ground and underground phone and internet cables were knocked out. With roads blocked and phones dead, officials said, the situation may be worse than they know. “We haven’t seen the extent of the damage,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello told reporters in the capital. More than 15 inches (nearly 40 centimeters) of rain fell on the mountains surrounding the Guajataca Dam in northwest Puerto Rico after Maria left the island Wednesday afternoon, swelling the reservoir behind the nearly 90-year-old dam. Authorities launched an evacuation of the 70,000 people living downstream, sending buses to move people away and sending frantic warnings on Twitter that went unseen by many in the blacked-out coastal area. “This is an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION,” the National Weather Service wrote. “All the areas around the Guajataca River must evacuate NOW. Your lives are in DANGER.” The 345-yard (316-meter) dam, which was built around 1928, holds back a manmade lake covering about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers). An engineer inspecting the dam reported a “contained breach” that officials quickly realized was a crack that could be the first sign of total failure of the dam, said Anthony Reynes, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service. “There’s no clue as to how long or how this can evolve. That is why the authorities are moving so fast because they also have the challenges of all the debris. It is a really, really dire situation,” Reynes said. “They are trying to mobilize all the resources they can but it’s not easy. We really don’t know how long it would take for this failure to become a full break of the dam.” Maj. Gen. Derek P. Rydholm, deputy to the chief of the Air Force Reserve, said at the Pentagon that it was impossible to say when communication and power will be restored. He said mobile communications systems are being flown in. But he acknowledged “it’s going to take a while” before people in Puerto Rico will be able to communicate with their families outside the island. Until Friday, he said, “there was no real understanding at all of the gravity of the situation.” Across the island more than 15,000 people are in shelters, including some 2,000 rescued from the north coastal town of Toa Baja, including several who were stranded on roofs. Rossello couldn’t say when power might be restored. The island’s electric grid was in sorry shape long before Maria struck. The territory’s $73 billion debt crisis has left agencies like the state power company broke. It abandoned most basic maintenance in recent years, leaving the island subject to regular blackouts. “Some transmission structures collapsed,” Rossello said, adding that there was no severe damage to electric plants. He said he was distributing 250 satellite phones from FEMA to mayors across the island to re-establish contact. Secretary of State Luis Marin said he expects gasoline supplies to be at 80 percent of capacity because the port in the southeastern town of Yabucoa that receives fuel shipments received minor damage. Hourslong lines formed at the few gas stations that reopened on Friday and anxious residents feared power could be out for weeks — or even months — and wondered how they would cope. Some of the island’s 3.4 million people planned to head to the U.S. to temporarily escape the devastation. At least in the short term, though, the soggy misery will continue: Additional rain — up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) — is expected through Saturday. In San Juan, Neida Febus wandered around her neighborhood with bowls of cooked rice, ground meat and avocado, offering food to the hungry. The damage was so extensive, the 64-year-old retiree said, that she didn’t think the power would be turned back on until Christmas. “This storm crushed us from one end of the island to the other,” she said. The death toll in Puerto Rico stood at six but was likely to rise. At least 27 lives in all have been lost around the Caribbean, including at least 15 on hard-hit Dominica. Haiti reported three deaths; Guadeloupe, two; and the Dominican Republic, one. By Friday night, Maria was passing about 295 miles (480 kilometers) east of the central Bahamas with top sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph). The storm is not expected to pose a threat to the U.S. mainland. Israel Molina, 68, found that Maria had ripped away roofing from his Israel Mini Market in San Juan. “I’m from here. I believe we have to step up to the task. If everyone leaves, what are we going to do? With all the pros and the cons, I will stay here,” he said, and then paused. “I might have a different response tomorrow.” Diana Jaquez, one of the owners of the Coquette hair salon in San Juan’s Santurce area, assessed storm damage with her husband Friday as their children played nearby. She said she hadn’t decided whether to leave the island. “Business has dropped a lot,” she said. “People have other priorities than looking good.” Outside her store, more than 100 people stood in line waiting to get money out of an ATM machine and hoping there would still be some cash left when their turn came. New York plans to send about 240 National Guardsmen and state troopers to assist Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The state is also sending drinking water, ready-to-eat meals, electrical generators and other supplies. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Hurricane Maria was a Category 4 storm, not a Category 5 one, when it crossed Puerto Rico.",https://apnews.com/fb547f6a316f4bdc8c226acac09e2426/Dam-failing-as-scope-of-Puerto-Rico's-disaster-becomes-clear,AP,Neutral
Fears of dam collapse add to Puerto Rico's misery after hurricane,Dave Graham,9/23/17,"Puerto Rico’s governor met mayors from around the ravaged island on Saturday after surveying damage to an earthen dam in the northwestern part of the U.S. territory that was threatening to collapse from flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

The U.S. National Weather Service said on its website the dam was still in danger of failing and triggering lifethreatening flash floods. “Stay away or be swept away,” it warned. Meanwhile, people across the island were struggling to dig out from the devastation left by the storm, which killed at least 25 people, including at least 10 in Puerto Rico, as it churned across the Caribbean, according to officials and media reports. “To all Puerto Ricans, please know we will get back up,” the governor tweeted as he met mayors in the territory to identify their most urgent needs. “Together with the mayors, as one government. 4Puerto Rico”In a development that could help the recovery effort, the Port of San Juan reopened, according to a Twitter message from the agency that operates it, allowing ships to unload supplies. Severe flooding, structural damage to homes and virtually no electric power were three of the most pressing problems facing Puerto Ricans, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo during a tour of the island. “It’s a terrible immediate situation that requires assistance from the federal government ,not just financial assistance,” said Cuomo, whose state is home to millions of people of Puerto Rican descent. Slideshow ( 23 images )“It is a dangerous situation today and it’s going to be a longterm reconstruction issue for months,” Cuomo, a Democrat and potential 2020 presidential candidate, told CNN. PATH OF DESTRUCTIONMaria, the second major hurricane to savage the Caribbean this month and the most powerful storm to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction on Wednesday. It knocked out electricity, apart from emergency generators, on the island of 3. 4 million inhabitants. Near the rainswollen Guajataca River, in the northwest part of the island, floodwater littered with branches and debris engulfed the first floor of a number of homes and swamped vehicles that were left behind. “We lost our house, it was completely flooded,” said resident Carmen Gloria Lamb. “We lost everything, cars, clothes, everything. ”The storm has resulted in 10 confirmed fatalities on the island so far, Rossello’s office told CNN on Saturday. The governor’s office could not be reached for comment by . Signs of the strain on Puerto Ricans were evident throughout San Juan, the capital. Drivers had to wait up to seven hours at the few filling stations open on Saturday, according to news reports, and lines of cars snaked for blocks. Hotels warned that guests might have to leave soon without fresh supplies of diesel to keep generators operating. Water rationing also began on Saturday. Signs posted throughout San Juan’s Old Town informed residents that service would return for two hours each day, between 5 p. m. and 7 p. m. , until further notice. Telephone service was also unreliable, with many of the island’s cell towers damaged or destroyed. Slideshow ( 23 images )People swarmed under some of the towers, holding up their devices in the hopes of getting a signal. The governor also extended a nightly curfew on Saturday, the Caribbean Business newspaper reported. At San Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, Mary Ann Arciola, her 32yearold daughter and two young grandchildren slept in a rented van hoping to get a flight home to the United States. “There’s nobody at the desks. There’s nothing on the screens,” said Arciola, 62. “There’s a ton of people. They are starting to fight. It’s not good. ”DEBT CRISISMaria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm on the fivestep SaffirSimpson scale as the island was already facing the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history. The storm may have caused an estimated $45 billion in damage and lost economic activity across the Caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in Puerto Rico, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, 14 deaths were reported on Dominica, an island nation of 71,000 inhabitants. Two people were killed in the French territory of Guadeloupe and one in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two people died in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, according to media outlet El Jaya. Maria still had sustained winds of up to 115 miles per hour (185 km per hour) on Saturday, making it a Category 3 hurricane, but was expected to weaken gradually over the next two days as it turned more sharply to the north. Dangerous surf and rip currents driven by the storm were expected along the southeastern coast of the U.S. mainland for several days, the National Hurricane Center said. Maria hit about two weeks after Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and the United States. It followed Hurricane Harvey, which also killed more than 80 people when it struck Texas in late August and caused flooding in Houston.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-idUKKCN1BY05J,Reuters,Neutral
The Latest: Trump speaks with Puerto Rico governor,No Author,9/22/17,"The Latest on Hurricane Maria (all times local): 9:55 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has spoken with the governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Trump said earlier Thursday that Puerto Rico was “absolutely obliterated” and the Virgin Islands were “flattened” by recent hurricanes Irma and Maria. The entire island of Puerto Rico was left without power after Maria knocked out its already weakened electrical grid. Trump said FEMA and other emergency responders are helping both U.S. territories begin the recovery process. He says he’ll visit Puerto Rico. ___ 8:05 p.m. Hurricane Maria has continued to strengthen slightly as its large eye approaches the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center in Miami says data from reconnaissance aircraft showed maximum sustained wind speed increasing Thursday to 125 mph (200 kph), up slightly from 120 mph (195 kph). It remains a Category 3 hurricane. Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas late Thursday or early Friday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the central Bahamas beginning late Friday. ___ 6:55 p.m. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose family is from Puerto Rico, says she hasn’t yet heard from half her family after Hurricane Maria walloped the island. Sotomayor, the high court’s first Hispanic justice, was speaking Thursday at an event at the Newseum in Washington. She said Puerto Rico “is suffering a great tragedy right now.” Sotomayor says that she and her family in the United States are “exceedingly concerned.” She asked for the crowd’s prayers for Puerto Rico but also the other islands, Texas and Florida that have been recently impacted by hurricanes. Sotomayor’s parents immigrated to the United States from Puerto Rico before she was born. Sotomayor grew up in New York. ___ 6:15 p.m. Authorities say Hurricane Maria’s winds ripped palm frond roofs away from trees and caused some other damage to restaurants in the Bavaro beach resorts on Dominican Republic’s east coast. Restaurant workers on Thurssay sought to remove the fallen trees from rooftops and clear away debris left by the storm in the popular beach resort populated by eateries and shops. But Ernesto Veloz, president of the hotel association in the Bavaro-Punta Cana tourist area, said he was relieved damage wasn’t any worse. “Thanks to God, we didn’t get the worst” of it, he said by phone. Earlier, the hotel association in the Dominican Republic reported Hurricane Maria didn’t inflict any serious damage to the county’s tourism infrastructure. ___ 6 p.m. A day after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, flooding towns, crushing homes and killing at least two people, millions of people on the island faced the dispiriting prospect of weeks and perhaps months without electricity. The storm knocked out the entire grid across the U.S. territory of 3.4 million, leaving many without power to light their homes, cook, pump water or run fans, air conditioners or refrigerators. Now many are hunting for gas canisters for cooking, collecting rainwater or steeling themselves mentally for the hardships to come in the tropical heat. Some are even contemplating leaving the island. “You cannot live here without power,” said Hector Llanos, a 78-year-old retired New York police officer who planned to go back to the U.S. mainland on Saturday to live there temporarily. Like many Puerto Ricans, Llanos does not have a generator or gas stove. “The only thing I have is a flashlight,” he said, shaking his head. ___ 2:35 p.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says a woman and two children were rescued from a boat that went missing off Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria, but a man died aboard the vessel. The Coast Guard in Miami said in a statement that a British Royal Navy helicopter hoisted three people Thursday from the capsized vessel. It had sent a distress call Wednesday saying it was disabled and adrift in seas with 20-foot (6-meter) waves and 100 mph (160 kph) winds near Vieques, Puerto Rico. The Coast Guard says the dead man’s body was not retrieved and that the boat had capsized. The search included an HC-130 search plane, a fast response cutter, the USS Kearsage amphibious assault ship and Navy helicopters. The names of those on the vessel were not released. ___ 1:50 p.m. Hurricane Maria has strengthened slightly as it nears the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center in Miami says data from reconnaissance aircraft showed maximum sustained wind speed increasing Thursday to 120 mph (195 kph), up slightly from 115 mph (185 kph). It remains a Category 3 hurricane. Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas late Thursday or early Friday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the central Bahamas beginning late Friday. ___ 1:20 p.m. New York City is sending emergency responders to Puerto Rico and is encouraging other city workers to volunteer with island recovery efforts. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Puerto Rico-born New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito discussed the Hurricane Maria efforts on Thursday. City workers will have to take vacation days or unpaid leave, but de Blasio says the city is trying to get them free transportation and places to stay. The city also is helping with fundraising. Nine New York City police and firefighters stayed in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma. Another 27 emergency responders will fly there when conditions allow. Emergency management personnel also will be deployed. An emotional Mark-Viverito says her family is safe but that other City Council members still haven’t heard from their loved ones. ___ 1:10 p.m. The search is on for a boat that went missing off Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria with two adults and two children aboard. The U.S. Coast Guard in Miami said in a news release that the vessel named Ferrel sent a distress call Wednesday saying it was disabled and adrift in seas with 20-foot (6-meter) waves and 100 mph (160 kph) winds. Communications were lost with the boat near Vieques, Puerto Rico. The Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and British Royal Navy are all assisting in the search Thursday. It includes an HC-130 search plane, a fast response cutter, the USS Kearsage amphibious assault ship and Navy helicopters. The names of those on the vessel were not released. ___ 12:55 p.m. The prime minister of Dominica says more than 15 people are dead and 20 remain missing after Hurricane Maria’s direct hit on the Caribbean island. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit cried as he spoke to a reporter on the nearby island of Antigua. He said more than 15 people died due to the storm and that it was a miracle that the death toll was not in the hundreds. The center of the Category 4 storm hit Dominica with massive force late Monday night and early Tuesday, destroying hundreds of homes and cutting off the mountainous island’s communication systems and shutting its airport. Skerrit says Dominica “is going to need all the help the world has to offer.” ___ 11:35 a.m. People in Puerto Rico are slowly digging out from Hurricane Maria. Many streets are blocked by downed trees and power lines. In some places, the roads are impassable because of floodwaters and people are getting around on rafts and kayaks. But there are also signs of life. People are removing their storm shutters. Lines are forming at the few restaurants that have generator power. They are a mix of tourist and locals as well as families with small children. Crews are visible throughout the island clearing debris and assessing damage. ___ 11:15 a.m. Forecasters say a severe flood threat is continuing across Puerto Rico as Hurricane Maria’s outer rain bands pelt the island. Senior Hurricane Specialist Mike Brennan at the U.S. National Hurricane Center says rains are expected to dump at least 4-8 inches (10-20 centimeters) of additional rain and up to 35 inches (85 centimeters) in isolated spots on the island. “We’re still seeing heavy rainfall occurring over Puerto Rico and that will exacerbate the flash flooding,” Brennan said Thursday via social media from the Miami-based center. He warned Puerto Rico residents who are venturing out after the storm to avoid areas near already flood-swollen rivers and not to attempt to cross flooded highways and roads on foot or in vehicles because of the threat to personal safety. Forecasters say the ongoing rains also raise the risk of life-threatening mudslides. ___ 10:25 a.m. President Donald Trump is providing an update on the U.S. response to a series of massive hurricanes. The president says in a meeting with the president of Ukraine that Texas and Florida are emerging from the hurricanes but says Puerto Rico was “absolutely obliterated” and the U.S. Virgin Islands were “flattened.” Trump says Puerto Rico is in “tough shape” after it was ravaged by Hurricane Maria and notes that the “electrical grid is destroyed.” The storm knocked out electricity to the entire island. But he says FEMA and other emergency responders are helping the islands and the southern U.S. states recover. The president has told reporters that he will visit Puerto Rico. ___ 9:35 a.m. Dominica Tourism Minister Robert Tonge (TUNG) is describing his badly damaged country three days after Hurricane Maria made landfall in the eastern Caribbean island. An update from Tonge says the capital of Roseau still has severe flooding and there’s heavy damage throughout the city. The hospital and a community center both lost roofs. One of two airports serving the country is inoperable while the other is expected to be operational in the coming days. An estimated 95 percent of the roofs were blown off in some towns, including Mahaut and Portsmouth. There are at least nine communities that no one has any information about because they’re cut off and most communications are down in the country. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit is expected to speak from the island of Antigua later Thursday. A number of people remain missing. ___ 9:35 a.m. The president of the hotel association in the Dominican Republic says Hurricane Maria didn’t do any damage to the county’s tourism infrastructure. Joel Santos says that assessment includes Punta Cana on the eastern tip of the country. That was the area closest to the eye when the storm passed on its way toward the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands to the north. The government evacuated more than 4,000 tourists to the capital of Santo Domingo. The meteorological service said Thursday that rain from the storm will continue in the Dominican Republic for the next two days for a total of around 19 inches (50 centimeters). ___ 8:15 a.m. President Donald Trump has approved a disaster declaration for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory. The declaration makes federal funding available to Puerto Ricans affected by the storm, which has knocked out power across the entire island Wednesday and caused flooding and landslides. Maria has killed at least 10 people across the Caribbean. The Category 3 hurricane has maximum sustained winds near 115 mph (185 kph). It’s centered about 95 miles (150 kilometers) north-northwest of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and is moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). ___ 5 a.m. Hurricane Maria is lashing the northeastern Dominican Republic early Thursday and is expected to pass near the Turks and Caicos later in the day. The Category 3 storm’s maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 kph) and the U.S. National Hurricane Center says some strengthening is possible during the next day or so. Maria, which has killed at least 10 people across the Caribbean, is centered about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and is moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph). Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans are rebuilding after the hurricane slammed into the U.S. territory Wednesday, crushing concrete balconies and paralyzing the island with landslides, flooding and downed trees. ___ 3:30 a.m. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans stunned by a hurricane that crushed concrete balconies and paralyzed the island with landslides, flooding and downed trees vowed to slowly rebuild amid an economic crisis as rescue crews fanned out across the U.S. territory. The extent of the damage is unknown given that dozens of municipalities remain isolated and without communication after Maria hit the island Wednesday morning as a Category 4 storm with 155 mph winds, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in over 80 years. Uprooted trees and widespread flooding blocked many highways and streets across the island, creating a maze that forced drivers to go against traffic and past police cars that used loudspeakers to warn people they must respect a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed by the governor to ensure everyone’s safety. ___ This story corrects day of Coast Guard rescue to Thursday, not Wednesday.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-maria-turks-and-caicos-islands-donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-8309c47f7ab6423cac00f3d85e5db5bf,AP,Neutral
"Storm Maria pitches Puerto Rico barrio into sunken ""Venice""",Dave Graham,9/22/17,"Wading through highways swamped by turbid waters that sloshed over scattered, sunken belongings, residents of this Puerto Rican barrio flooded by Hurricane Maria have begun emerging from their shattered homes. People walk next to fallen electric poles and traffic sings after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Salinas, Puerto Rico, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Lying southwest of the capital San Juan, the Juana Matos neighbourhood in Catano municipality took a huge hit from Maria after the storm slammed winds of up to 155 mph (249 kmh) into Puerto Rico early on Wednesday, destroying or damaging an estimated 80 percent of housing in the workingclass barrio. The storm, the second Category 5 hurricane to batter the Caribbean this month, claimed at least 32 lives across the region, including 15 in Puerto Rico, and shut down power and communications across the island of 3. 4 million people. By Thursday, Maria’s floodwaters had turned the heart of the predominantly woodbuilt Juana Matos barrio into a series of waterways more suited to boats than walking. “It’s like we’re in Venice,” said 69yearold steel worker Joaquin Rebollo, looking out across a broad channel that is normally teeming with cars. “It was a really bad experience, really bad. I almost died of fright. ”Pitching the roof off his home and dozens of others in the area, Maria began to work through the wiring around the house as darkness descended across the island. “It was like (Maria) was chewing the cables,” he said, vividly making as if to bite through power lines with his teeth. Opposite him, residents trudged up to their knees in waters covering what was the main highway connecting Catano with the municipality of Bayamon further south. Rebollo and many neighbours left their homes in the hope the flooding that rose to four feet in some areas would recede. Houses locked for the storm were stripped of roofs or walls. Stranded cars stood halfsunk in driveways and satellite dishes tilted towards the sky to receive signals that had gone. “I peeked my head out during the storm and felt the wind ,and saw the wood, the roof, and the windows in the air,” said Domingo Avilez, 47, who took cover inside a small cement stock room beneath his mother’s house when Maria struck. Slideshow ( 2 images )By the end, the stock room was the only room left. Local officials estimate upwards of 2,000 people live in Juana Matos, and many too old or unwilling to evacuate watched from upper floors as the floodwaters turned streets into stagnant canals that seeped through their homes. “Well, we’re alive,” said 75yearold grandfather Angel Santos from the debrisstrewn second floor of his wooden home. “These are the works of God, so there’s nothing you can do,” Santos said, reflecting the faith evident among many Puerto Ricans hit by Maria just days after Hurricane Irma left. Even those on the edge of the floodprone barrio in homes high enough to avoid shipping huge quantities of water suffered brutal incursions. Magdalena Oliveras, a 52yearold housewife, showed the twisted metal blinds of her twometer high washroom window she said had been mangled by a deluge from a nearby building. Lidia Espinal, 57, a longtime Juana Matos resident from the Dominican Republic, suffered a double blow on Wednesday morning before phone lines went down with a call from her homeland to say her younger brother had suffered a fatal heart attack. But Maria’s presence meant she could not travel back. “I lost everything in my house, the good things, the roof, the windows. The stove is full of water,” she said. “But the death of my brother taught me that we can’t hold on to material things. Because life does not come back. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-storm-maria-puertorico-idUKKCN1BX0DO,Reuters,Neutral
Hurricane Maria may spell more trouble for Puerto Rico bondholders,Laila Kearney,9/22/17,"Hurricane Maria could imperil Puerto Rico’s longterm economic recovery and hinder its ability to pay back bondholders waiting for the U.S. territory to emerge from years of financial strife, analysts and investors said. Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico midweek and tore across the island of 3. 4 million people, destroying buildings and downing nearly all power and communications. Disaster modeler Enki Research estimates damage to the island at $30 billion, with $20 billion in direct physical damage and $10 billion in economic impact. “The conclusion is it’s not good for bondholders because they (Puerto Rico) will have reduced economic capacity to pay back debt,” S&P Global Ratings analyst David Hitchcock said. Struggling under $72 billion in debt, Puerto Rico filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history earlier this year. Complicating recovery efforts, Puerto Rico is under the oversight of a federallyappointed Financial Oversight and Management Board. It cannot issue new debt or change its budgetary allocations without approval. The board on Thursday approved reallocating up to $1 billion of the budget to be used for emergency funding, though the cost of cleanup is expected to dwarf that. Destruction from Maria, which struck less than three weeks after Hurricane Irma, could stymie much needed economic growth. Manufacturing is expected to be temporarily halted as the island deals with power outages, and a drop in tourism would reduce sales tax and other revenue used to service bonds, Hitchcock said. Still, Hurricane Maria likely won’t affect the credit rating agency’s “D” rating of Puerto Rico’s general obligation and sales tax bonds. “From a credit perspective, you can’t get worse than that,” Hitchcock said. Prices on Puerto Rico general obligation bonds were slightly lower in thin trading posthurricane, moving closer to about half of par value in the $55. 75 to $54. 75 range, according to Municipal Market Data, a unit of Thomson . “Certainly if you look at it from a perspective of where bonds are (trading) they generally think that Maria is going to have some sort of an impact on the island,” said Jonathan Mondillo, portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, which holds insured Puerto Rican bonds. The timeliness of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds will play into how quickly Puerto Rico gets back on its feet, Hitchcock said. “Given the relief money they are going to get just to rebuild the island, I would bet that will put the bondholders further back in line to receive any payments,” said Christopher Ryon, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, who does not own any Puerto Rico debt.

"Maria destroys homes, triggers flooding in Puerto Rico",DANICA COTO,9/21/17,"The strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in more than 80 years destroyed hundreds of homes, knocked out power across the entire island and turned some streets into raging rivers Wednesday in an onslaught that could plunge the U.S. territory deeper into financial crisis. Leaving at least nine people dead in its wake across the Caribbean, Hurricane Maria blew ashore in the morning near the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa as a Category 4 storm with winds of 155 mph (250 kph). It punished the island of 3.4 million people with life-threatening winds for several hours, the second time in two weeks that Puerto Rico has felt the wrath of a hurricane. “Once we’re able to go outside, we’re going to find our island destroyed,” warned Abner Gomez, Puerto Rico’s emergency management director. “The information we have received is not encouraging. It’s a system that has destroyed everything in its path.” As people waited in shelters or took cover inside stairwells, bathrooms and closets, Maria brought down cell towers and power lines, snapped trees, tore off roofs and unloaded at least 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain. Widespread flooding was reported, with dozens of cars half-submerged in some neighborhoods and many streets turned into rivers. People calling local radio stations reported that doors were being torn off their hinges and a water tank flew away. Felix Delgado, mayor of the northern coastal city of Catano, told The Associated Press that 80 percent of the 454 homes in a neighborhood known as Juana Matos were destroyed. The fishing community near San Juan Bay was hit with a storm surge of more than 4 feet (1.2 meters), he said. “Months and months and months and months are going to pass before we can recover from this,” he said. Gov. Ricardo Rossello imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily until Saturday to allow rescue crews and officials to respond to the hurricane’s aftermath. “We are at a critical moment in the effort to help thousands of Puerto Ricans that urgently need aid and to assess the great damage caused by Hurricane Maria,” he said. “Maintaining public order will be essential.” Rossello said in an interview on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” that one fatality has been reported but because communications were knocked out in some areas, the total casualty count wasn’t known. Maria weakened to a Category 2 storm later in the day but re-strengthened to Category 3 status early Thursday with winds of 115 mph (185 kph). It was centered about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph). Even before the storm, Puerto Rico’s electrical grid was crumbling and the island was in dire condition financially. Puerto Rico is struggling to restructure a portion of its $73 billion debt, and the government has warned it is running out of money as it fights against furloughs and other austerity measures imposed by a federal board overseeing the island’s finances. Rossello urged people to have faith: “We are stronger than any hurricane. Together, we will rebuild.” He asked President Donald Trump to declare the island a disaster zone, a step that would open the way to federal aid. Late Wednesday night, Trump tweeted: “Governor @ricardorossello- We are with you and the people of Puerto Rico. Stay safe! #PRStrong.” Many people feared extended power outages would further sink businesses struggling amid a recession that has lasted more than a decade. “This is going to be a disaster,” said Jean Robert Auguste, who owns two French restaurants and sought shelter at a San Juan hotel. “We haven’t made any money this month.” More than 11,000 people — and more than 580 pets — were in shelters, authorities said. Along the island’s northern coast, an emergency medical station in the town of Arecibo lost its roof, while communication was severed with several emergency management posts. A hospital and a police station reported broken windows, and a tree fell on an ambulance. As the storm closed in on the Dominican Republic, about 4,000 tourists in the Bavara-Punta Cana area on the eastern tip of the island were moved to hotels in Santo Domingo, the capital. About 100 flights were canceled and the government suspended school and sent workers home. “The government has prepared itself for the worst case scenario and so should the people,” presidential administrative secretary Jose Ramon Peralta said. Maria posed no immediate threat to the U.S. mainland. The long-range forecast showed the storm out in the Atlantic Ocean hundreds of miles off the Georgia-South Carolina coast by Monday morning. Previously a Category 5 with 175 mph (281 kph) winds, Maria hit Puerto Rico as the third-strongest storm to make landfall in the U.S., based on its central pressure. It was even stronger than Hurricane Irma when Irma roared into the Florida Keys earlier this month. Irma sideswiped Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, causing no deaths or widespread damage on the island but leaving more than 1 million people without electricity. More than 70,000 still had no power as Maria approached. As Maria closed in, Trump offered his support via Twitter: “Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane. Be careful, our hearts are with you - will be there to help!” The storm’s center passed near or over St. Croix overnight Tuesday, prompting U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp to warn people to sleep in their street clothes and shoes just in case. St. Croix was largely spared by Irma. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries on St. Croix, but it was still too dangerous Wednesday to venture out and conduct a thorough check, said Nykole Tyson, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Virgin Islands Emergency Operations Center. On the island of Dominica, which got slammed late Monday, Hartley Henry, an adviser to the prime minister, reported at least seven deaths and a “tremendous loss of housing and public buildings.” He said the country was “in a daze,” with no electricity and little to no communications. Dominica’s airport and seaports remained closed, and authorities used helicopters to carry emergency food, water and shelter materials to the island, said Ronald Jackson, head of the Caribbean Disaster and Emergency Management Agency. ___ Associated Press writers Ben Fox in Miami and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/floods-puerto-rico-hurricane-irma-weather-forecasts-5f2002103e2f42e4916efeda88d0e511,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico judge advises legal issues be put on hold after Maria -source,Nick Brown,9/21/17,"The devastating blows dealt to Puerto Rico by Hurricanes Irma and Maria are putting the woebegone U.S. territory’s bankruptcy on the backburner, sources said on Thursday. According to a person familiar with the bankruptcy proceedings, the team of judges overseeing the case has directed parties to put legal issues on hold indefinitely, as the territory recovers from an unprecedented onetwo punch of natural disasters. According to the person, judges have also told parties the island’s fiscal turnaround blueprint may need to be redrafted once the cost of the destruction becomes clear, as well as how much aid Puerto Rico is expected to get from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. Maria was ranked a Category 4 storm, near the top of the fivestep SaffirSimpson scale, with winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph), when it made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the strongest storm to hit the island in nearly 90 years. It struck less than two weeks after Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc there. Officials in Puerto Rico have said power could be out for months, while devastating flooding continues to ravage lowlying areas on the mountainous Caribbean isle. Puerto Rico is already reeling under a $72 billion debt load it cannot pay. Earlier this year, it filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, suffering from nearinsolvent public health and pension systems, a 45 percent poverty rate, and a shrinking population as locals flee to the mainland United States. A separate source, familiar with the Puerto Rican government’s thinking, said a moratorium on legal proceedings will likely be necessary, including the possible cancellation of a scheduled Oct. 4 bankruptcy hearing, though that remained unclear. “Puerto Rico won’t be functional at all for two or three weeks, and won’t be fully functional for at least a month,” the person said. “The government is living basically like a family that lives paycheck to paycheck, and the paychecks aren’t going to get here because our treasury is not going to be able to collect anything,” the person said. Spokespersons for Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico’s federal oversight board did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Judge Laura Taylor Swain, the lead judge in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, could not immediately be reached.

Hurricane Maria aims at Puerto Rico after slamming Dominica,DANICA COTO and CARLISLE JNO BAPTISTE,9/20/17,"Hurricane Maria barreled toward Puerto Rico on Tuesday night after wreaking widespread devastation on Dominica and leaving the small Caribbean island virtually incommunicado. As rains began to lash Puerto Rico, Gov. Ricardo Rossello warned that Maria could hit “with a force and violence that we haven’t seen for several generations.” “We’re going to lose a lot of infrastructure in Puerto Rico,” Rossello said, adding that a likely island wide power outage and communication blackout could last for days. “We’re going to have to rebuild.” Authorities warned that people in wooden or flimsy homes should find safe shelter before the storm’s expected arrival Wednesday. “You have to evacuate. Otherwise, you’re going to die,” said Hector Pesquera, the island’s public safety commissioner. “I don’t know how to make this any clearer.” By Tuesday night, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Maria’s winds had intensified to 175 mph (280 kph) and additional strengthening was possible. At 11 p.m. EST, Maria was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south-southeast of St. Croix, or 120 miles (190 kilometers) southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was moving west-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph). Maria’s center was expected to pass several miles south of St. Croix late Tuesday on its way to Puerto Rico, prompting U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp to ask that people remain alert. St. Croix was largely spared the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Irma on the chain’s St. Thomas and St. John islands just two weeks ago. But this time, the island would experience five hours of hurricane force winds starting about 11 p.m. EST, Mapp said. “For folks in their homes, I really recommend that you not be in any kind of sleepwear,” he said during a brief press conference late Tuesday. “Make sure you have your shoes on. Make sure you have a jacket around. Something for your head in case your roof should breach. ... I don’t really recommend you be sleeping from 11 o’clock to 4 (a.m.). ... Be aware of what’s going on around you.” The warning came after Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit sent out a series of dramatic posts on his Facebook page as the storm blew over that tiny country late Monday — but then stopped suddenly as phone and internet connections with the country were cut. “The winds are merciless! We shall survive by the grace of God,” Skerrit wrote before communications went down. A few minutes later, he messaged he could hear the sound of galvanized steel roofing tearing off houses on the small rugged island. He said that even his own roof had blown away. In the last message before falling silent, he appealed for international aid: “We will need help, my friends, we will need help of all kinds.” The storm knocked out communications for the entire country, leaving anyone outside Dominica struggling to determine the extent of damage, though it was clearly widespread. “The situation is really grave,” Consul General Barbara Dailey said in a telephone interview from New York. She said she lost contact with the island about 4 a.m. At that point, officials had learned that 70 percent of homes had lost their roofs, including her own. “I lost everything,” she said, adding there had been no word on casualties. “As a Category 5 it would be naive not to expect any (injuries) but I don’t know how many,” she said. The island’s broadcast service was also down Tuesday and Akamai Technologies, a company that tracks the status of the internet around the world, said most of Dominica’s internet service appeared to have been lost by midday. The Ross University School of Medicine in Dominica reported a widespread loss of communication on the island, and relatives of students posted messages on its Facebook page saying they had been unable to talk to their loved ones since late Monday evening as the storm approached. Dominica is particularly vulnerable to flooding because of its steep mountains, cut through with rivers that rage even after a heavy rain. It was still recovering from Tropical Storm Erika, which killed 30 people and destroyed more than 370 homes in August 2015. Officials on the neighboring French island of Guadeloupe reported at least one death: a person hit by a falling tree. They said two other people were reported missing after their boat sank off La Desirade island, just east of Guadeloupe. About 40 percent of the island — 80,000 homes — were without power and flooding was reported in several communities. In the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, normally crowded streets and beaches were empty by Tuesday afternoon as families heading to safe shelter packed up their cars and pets or secured windows and doors around their home to prepare for severe winds expected to lash the island for 12 to 24 hours. Nearly 2,800 people were in shelters across Puerto Rico, along with 105 pets, officials said. “We’re definitely afraid,” said Erica Huber, a 33-year-old teacher from Venice, Florida, who moved to Puerto Rico a month ago with her 12-year-old daughter. “I’m more worried about the aftermath: Is there going to be enough food and water?” she said. In shops across the island, shelves were bare after people filled shopping carts with the limited amount of water, batteries, baby formula, milk and other items they could find. Iris Tosado, a 64-year-old widowed housewife, scanned the nearly empty shelves before heading back home. She and her disabled son planned to spend the storm with relatives because their home is made of wood, and she prayed that it would not be destroyed. “God, it’s the only thing I have,’” she said. “This is not looking good.” Maria ties for the eighth strongest storm in Atlantic history, when measured by wind speed. This year’s Irma, which had 185 mph (300 kph) winds, ranks second. Hurricane center forecasters said it “now appears likely” that Maria will still be at Category 5 intensity when it moves over the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday night and Puerto Rico on Wednesday, bringing with it “life-threatening” flooding from rain and storm surge. Forecasters said the storm surge could raise water levels by 6 to 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) near the storm’s center. The storm was predicted to bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain across the islands, with more in isolated areas. To the north, Hurricane Jose weakened to a tropical storm Tuesday night. Forecasters said dangerous surf and rip currents were likely to continue along the U.S. East Coast but said the storm was unlikely to make landfall. Big waves caused by Jose swept five people off a coastal jetty in Rhode Island and they were hospitalized after being rescued. A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and tropical storm watches were up for parts of New York’s Long Island and Connecticut. ____ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico opens arms to refugees from Irma's Caribbean chaos,Alvin Baez,9/13/17,"Saddled with economic problems and its own damage from Hurricane Irma, Puerto Rico is taking thousands of refugees from the U.S. Virgin Islands whose homes were destroyed by the storm, with a cruise ship carrying up to 2,000 more due to set sail for the U.S. territory on Wednesday. A child looks at donated clothes at a convention centre for Caribbean refugees whose homes were destroyed by Hurricane Irma, in San Juan, Puerto Rico September 14, 2017.  REUTERS/Alvin BaezVisibly shaken residents from St. Martin and the Virgin Islands arrived on Tuesday on U.S. military aircraft, bringing tales of terrifying winds and a breakdown of law and order. “The people of Puerto Rico ,what big hearts you guys got because our (local) government did nothing ,nothing,” said William Vonfabrice, 61, from St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. “People coming at us with machetes, offering bullets and saying ‘There is more for you,’ breaking into houses, hurting people. ”Royal Caribbean’s Majesty of the Seas cruise ship was expected to depart the badly damaged St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, on Wednesday evening bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands commissioner of tourism Beverly NicholsonDoty said. Irma skirted Puerto Rico last week, knocking out power to 70 percent of the island, damaging buildings and killing at least three people, but the destruction was not nearly as bad as elsewhere in the Caribbean. The storm’s 185 mph (297 km/h) winds hammered a string of tiny Caribbean islands that are territories of Britain, France, the Netherlands and the United States. Homes, hotels, hospitals, marinas and airports were badly damaged and the extent of the chaos seemed to catch the wealthy nations off guard. Britain’s government said local authorities had imposed a curfew on the British Virgin islands, where locals complained of widespread looting and violent crime after Irma. U. K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited the islands on Wednesday, calling them a “scene of utter devastation” on Twitter as his government announced £25 billion ($33 billion) in extra aid for its territories. The nations all have launched military relief operations but locals and tourists have criticized the response for being too slow and not reaching everybody evenly. Visiting the French Caribbean on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron promised to quickly rebuild St. Martin, a French territory shared with the Netherlands. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson met with security officials in Anguilla. Dutch King WillemAlexander said the destruction he saw in St. Martin was on a scale he “had never seen before. ”Slideshow ( 15 images )‘THE END OF SINT MAARTEN’Charles Morrison, 89, an evacuee from the Dutch part of the island, Sint Maarten, said one person was killed when the hotel he was staying in was flooded and partially destroyed. Morrison then took shelter in a friend’s more secure place. “The fact is, that’s the end of Sint Maarten,” he said as he was pushed through San Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in a wheelchair. Puerto Rico has $70 billion in debt, a poverty rate above 46 percent, and nearinsolvent pension and health systems, a fact not lost on the arrivals. “God bless Puerto Rico and the hearts because you guys are struggling. And from the hardest struggle, that’s where the real people come out,” Vonfabrice said, thanking Puerto Rico for sending food, water and ships to the Virgin Islands. A Puerto Rico government spokeswoman said the financial situation and expected length of stay of the 2,000 refugees due to arrive in San Juan was still unclear, but that expenses would be covered by emergency federal funding. Puerto Rico has set up a large convention center to house refugees who cannot afford to go to a hotel. Other countries in the region also helped. St. Lucia has agreed to house prisoners from the Turks and Caicos Islands and the British Virgin Islands, after the storm damaged the prisons in those British territories. The Cayman Islands has sent police to help reinforce security in the British Virgin Islands after more than 100 prisoners escaped when the storm breached the prison. Mexico’s foreign minister Luis Videgaray instructed his diplomats in the Caribbean to offer unspecified help to Puerto Rico and Cuba even as it seeks to cope with the fallout from a massive earthquake. St. Thomas resident Laci Rivers, 33, was waiting on board the Royal Caribbean’s Majesty of the Seas, eager to bring her two small children to safety after days of uncertainty. “Everyone is stressed and hungry and confused,” she said. Rivers said her car was broken into with a hammer, items were stolen from the flattened sushi restaurant where she worked, and she saw fights break out in St. Thomas among increasingly desperate people jostling for food and water. She was under no illusions about what would happen to her home in western St. Thomas. “We’ve already realized it’s going to be looted while we’re gone,” she said.

"UPDATE 7-'Potentially catastrophic' Irma barrels toward Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico",Scott Malone,9/5/17,"8)SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Sept 5 () ,Hurricane Irma, one of the most forceful Atlantic storms in a century, churned across the ocean on Tuesday on a collision course with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bearing down on the northern Caribbean with a devastating mix of fierce winds, surf and rain. The eye of Irma, a Category 5 storm packing winds of 185 miles per hour (295 km per hour), was expected to sweep through the northern Leeward Islands, east of Puerto Rico, on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, en route to a Florida landfall on Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami reported. The threat posed to the U.S. mainland by Irma, described by NHC forecasters as a “potentially catastrophic” storm, loomed as Texas and Louisiana continued to reel from widespread destructive flooding from Hurricane Harvey. President Donald Trump on Tuesday approved prelandfall emergency declarations for Florida and the American territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, mobilizing federal disaster relief efforts in all three jurisdictions ahead of Irma’s arrival, the White House said. Hurricane warnings, the highest level of NHC alerts, were posted for several of the Leeward Islands, including Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, as well as for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. “Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,” the Hurricane Center said, warning that Irma “will bring lifethreatening wind, storm surge and rainfall hazards” to those islands. Along the beachfront of Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan, work crews scrambled to cover windows with plywood and corrugated metal shutters along Avenida Ashford, a stretch of restaurants, hotels and sixstory apartments. “I am worried because this is the biggest storm we have seen here,” said Jonathan Negron, 41, as he supervised workers boarding up his souvenir shop. On a nearby beach, where calm surf on Tuesday belied the fury that Irma was forecast to bring, Denise Watkins, 52, of Midlothian, Texas, was reconsidering her vacation plans. “I just got off the plane, and I already want to leave. I do not want to be here for this storm,” Watkins said. Pointing to boardedup oceanfront windows, she said, “I see everything covered up like that and it makes me nervous. ”At 8 p. m. EDT (0000 GMT), Irma was about 85 miles (140 km) east of Antigua in the eastern Caribbean and moving west at 15 miles per hour (24 kph), according to the NHC. Maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, with hurricaneforce winds extending 60 miles (95 km) from the storm’s center, forecasters said. The NHC said Irma ranked as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes during the past 80 years and the strongest in the Atlantic storm outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico in NHC records. STORM UPGRADEDThe storm was upgraded to a Category 5, the highest NHC designation, earlier in the day. While some fluctuations in intensity are likely, Irma is expected to remain a Category 4 or 5 for the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello urged the 3. 4 million residents of the U.S. territory to seek refuge in one of 460 hurricane shelters in advance of the storm and later ordered police and National Guard troops to begin evacuations of floodprone areas in the north and east of the island. “This is something without precedent,” Rossello told a news conference. Police later confirmed that a 75yearold man died while preparing for the storm in the island’s central mountains. Authorities in the Florida Keys called for a mandatory evacuation of the islands’ visitors to start at sunrise on Wednesday, and public schools throughout South Florida were ordered closed, some as early as Wednesday. Residents of lowlying areas in densely populated MiamiDade County were urged to move to higher ground by Wednesday as a precaution against coastal storm surges, three days before Irma was expected to make landfall in Florida. Several tiny islands in the resortheavy eastern Caribbean were the first in harm’s way. Gary Randall, head of the Blue Waters Resort on Antigua’s north coast, said the staff had boarded up windows, stripped trees of coconuts and fronds and secured anything that could become a hazard. “I wasn’t that nervous yesterday, but today I’m nervous,” Randall said by telephone, adding that he expected the hotel’s beach to be swept away and much of the 108room property to be flooded. Hurricane watches were in effect for Guadeloupe, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. Julia Nuñez Rodriguez, a single mother of three who lives north of Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, was most worried about the potentially high death toll. “I’m hoping and praying for the best,” she said. Airlines canceled flights to the region, and American Airlines added three extra flights to Miami from San Juan, St. Kitts and St. Maarten. Irma is expected to become the second powerful storm to thrash the U.S. mainland in as many weeks, but its precise trajectory remained uncertain on Tuesday. The Atlantic hurricane season ends on Nov. 30. Residents of Texas and Louisiana were still recovering from Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25. It dumped several feet of rain, destroying thousands of homes and businesses, killed an estimated 60 people and displaced more than 1 million others. Texasbased television producer Bryan Eckert, who endured the upheaval of Harvey last week, found himself on Tuesday in the path of Irma as he and his wife sought to take an illfated sailing getaway to recoup in the British Virgin Islands. “We thought we’d have a nice trip to island hop,” Eckert, 50, an employee of the NBC affiliate station in San Antonio, said by telephone as he hunkered down on the second floor of a Tortola hotel. “I thought this would be a vacation. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/storm-irma-idUKL2N1LM0AG,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico declares state of emergency ahead of Hurricane Irma,Alana Wise,9/4/17,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló on Monday declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in preparation for the arrival of Irma, a dangerous Category 3 hurricane. Slideshow ( 6 images )Irma, which is forecast to strengthen on Tuesday night, is set hit the U.S. territory on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. “Despite the economic challenges Puerto Rico is facing, the approved budget has $15 million for the emergency fund,” Rosselló said in a statement. The island of about 3. 4 million people has 456 emergency shelters prepared to house up to 62,100 people. To help residents prepare for the storm, the Puerto Rican government activated a price freeze on basic necessities, including food and water, medicines, power generators and batteries. A Category 3 hurricane on the fivestep SaffirSimpson scale means sustained winds of 111129 miles per hour (178208 kph) with “devastating” outcomes, including uprooted trees, water and electricity outages, and significant property damage, according to the Miamibased hurricane center. The storm will be the second powerful hurricane to thrash the United States and its territories in as many weeks. Residents in Texas and Louisiana are still reeling from the catastrophic effects of the deadly Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25 and dumped several feet (meters) of rain, destroying thousands of homes and businesses. The intensifying Hurricane Irma also threatens to pummel the Caribbean, Florida and the U.S. East Coast, according to the National Hurricane Center, which cautioned that it was still too early to forecast its exact path or what effects it might have on the continental United States. “There is an increasing chance of seeing some impacts from Irma in the Florida Peninsula and the Florida Keys later this week and this weekend. In addition, rough surf and dangerous marine conditions will begin to affect the southeastern U.S. coast by later this week,” the center said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-irma-puertorico-idUSKCN1BF25W,Reuters,Neutral
Government labor strife is latest test for fractured Puerto Rico,Nick Brown,8/30/17,"Puerto Rico’s already frail economy faces a fresh test this week, as the bankrupt U.S. territory’s financial overseers try to force a defiant governor to furlough public workers, the single biggest block of employees on the island. An escalating power struggle between the democratically elected Governor Ricardo Rossello and the federally appointed oversight panel culminated on Monday when the board sued Rossello, saying he had no authority to reject pension cuts and furloughs ordered by the board. The measures are set to begin Sept 1. A competing lawsuit from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which represents 12,000 Puerto Rican workers, argues the exact opposite ,that the measures violate the U.S. Constitution, and should be halted. At least six unions are staging protests on Wednesday to oppose the austerity, featuring a midday march to the board’s San Juan offices. Puerto Rico, shouldering $72 billion in debt, has filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history as it reels from a shrinking population, a 45 percent poverty rate and nearinsolvent public health and retirement systems. As hostility over labor now mounts, stakes are high ,and the island’s investors are taking note. Defeating the furloughs and pension cuts could undercut the board’s authority to impose politically unappealing structural fixes that Puerto Rico may need, and for which investors have long agitated ,labor reform included. As of July, more than a quarter of all nonfarm jobs in Puerto Rico were in the public sector. This is a higher percentage than any U.S. state, and roughly 10 percentage points above the U.S. average of 15. 2 percent, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet, should the board’s proposals take effect, thousands of statelevel government workers would suffer cuts to their income, which could crimp spending capacity among public employees and perpetuate labor strife. “For any plan to restructure Puerto Rico to be legitimate, it needs buyin from employees,” said Matt Fabian, a municipal debt analyst at MMA Inc. Some municipalities have already cut hours or wages. The board has said its proposed twodayamonth furloughs could save $218 million this fiscal year, nearly a quarter of the $880 million of savings from government “rightsizing” that the board has called for. Investors welcome labor reform. But as the issue becomes increasingly contentious, some fret that the board’s arrival in 2016, under the federal Puerto Rico rescue law dubbed PROMESA, has only made the island’s economic picture more chaotic. “Everyone’s goals should be aligned,” said Ben Eiler, managing partner at First Southern Securities, which has offices in Puerto Rico and trades the island’s debt. But the board and Rossello have been anything but aligned. The former was tapped by U.S. lawmakers to help Puerto Rico restructure debt and cut spending. The latter, elected last November, is struggling to balance a campaign promise of fiscal stability with protecting the mostly poor voters who elected him. Rossello may see political advantage in going to the mat to avoid furloughs, rather than embrace them as an alternative to layoffs, said Tracy Gordon, a municipal debt expert and senior fellow at the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center. “Even if he loses,” Gordon said, “at least he’s known for taking a stand. ”Eiler would rather both sides compromise quickly. He says achieving labor peace is key, not just for workers, but for investors who want to see the island’s economy grow. Noting a Rossello initiative to privatize some public assets, Eiler said “the unions’ cooperation is imperative” for publicprivate partnerships. “It can dramatically affect the sales price,” he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-labor-idUSL2N1LF211,Reuters,Neutral
More than 200 doomed Puerto Rico dogs saved by airlift to US,RICARDO ARDUENGO,8/25/17,"They were a mix of breeds and sizes, ranging from puppies to seniors. All faced a grim future in Puerto Rico animal shelters, where chronic overcrowding results in many dogs being euthanized. That changed Wednesday for 205 abandoned canines that arrived on the U.S. mainland in an airlift organized by animal welfare advocates working to ease the load. “The shelters in Puerto Rico have no choice,” said Kimberly Alboum, director of policy engagement and shelter outreach for the Humane Society of the United States. “They run out of room and, unfortunately, they have to euthanize for space. It’s heartbreaking for the staff and it’s devastating because these animals are all highly adoptable.” The island territory has struggled with dog overpopulation for years due to factors such as poorly funded shelters and low spaying and neutering rates. It’s common to see packs of what locals refer to as “satos” roaming through Puerto Rican communities, and one stretch of coast near the town of Yabucoa became so infamous for abandoned and abused pets that it was dubbed Dead Dog Beach. Activists in Puerto Rico and on the mainland have been working on the problem and say there are signs of improvement. Christina Beckles, founder of the Puerto Rico-based Sato Project, said fewer dogs are ending up on Dead Dog Beach thanks in part to a campaign to spay and neuter in Yabucoa. But there have also been setbacks, including a deep economic crisis that led many islanders to decamp for the mainland and leave their pets behind. “People are leaving the island in droves because they can’t afford to live here,” Beckles said. “I would never condone someone abandoning an animal, but I understand.” While various organizations have airlifted dogs out of Puerto Rico in recent years, this latest effort is believed to be the largest number in a single trip. Many of the animals came from two shelters: One in the hills above Mayaguez that has a hard time finding people to adopt its animals because it is so remote, and another in a condemned building with no power or water near Cabo Rojo that had to clear its entire population for a badly needed renovation. Dellymar Bernal Martinez, president of the Saint Francis of Assis Animal Sanctuary in Cabo Rojo, cried as she hugged a departing beige, medium-sized dog that had been born at the shelter three years earlier. “It’s bittersweet. I’m sad she is leaving but she is going to a better place.” The dogs were checked by veterinarians, taken to the San Juan airport and then flown in two planes provided by a group called Wings of Rescue. They landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, dogs peeking nervously out of their carriers as volunteers unloaded them and transferred them to waiting vans. One planeload of dogs was destined for shelters around the state. The other aircraft refueled and went on to North Carolina, with its canines continuing on to various shelters including Animal Haven in New York City. About two dozen ended up at a facility run by the Humane Society of Broward County in Fort Lauderdale. “They’ll all get adopted,” shelter director Mary Steffen said. “They will go fast.” _____ Associated Press writer Ben Fox in Miami contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-caribbean-ap-top-news-animal-welfare-dogs-08eb711181d24da7a753b1914ed8c316,AP,Neutral

Bondholders seek receiver for Puerto Rico utility PREPA,Nick Brown,7/18/17,"After three years of futile efforts to restructure some $9 billion of debt at Puerto Rico’s PREPA, creditors of the nowbankrupt power utility are asking a U.S. federal judge to appoint a receiver to manage PREPA’s assets. A man walks past the headquarters of Puerto Rican power utility PREPA (also known as AEE) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, June 30, 2015.  REUTERS/Alvin BaezHernandez In papers filed on Tuesday in U.S. bankruptcy court in San Juan, PREPA creditors said a receiver was needed to ensure the utility sets electricity rates high enough to service debt. Political appointees of Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Rossello, they argued, cannot be trusted to do so. “PREPA’s interests cannot be adequately served or protected if they are subjected to the whims of the governor’s agenda,” said the creditors, which include bondholders such as Oppenheimer Funds and insurers like Assured Guaranty. A spokeswoman for Rossello had no immediate comment. The request is the latest chapter in the long saga of PREPA, the quasipublic power company. Hamstrung by outdated plants, PREPA has not raised rates in decades. Its plight is seen as a microcosm of broader trouble in Puerto Rico, the cashstrapped U.S. territory laden with $72 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, which earlier this year filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. PREPA and its bondholders began restructuring talks in 2014, reaching two deals that both fell apart. The first was rejected by Rossello, the second by Puerto Rico’s federallyappointed financial oversight board, which expressed concern that rate hikes could hurt consumers and exacerbate Puerto Rico’s woes. Puerto Rico residents already pay rates around twice the U.S. average, according to federal government data. Bondholders would have accepted 15 percent cuts to repayments in exchange for higherrated bonds secured by a dedicated charge on customer bills. Unable to close the deal, Puerto Rico’s government and oversight board pushed PREPA into bankruptcy earlier this month. The creditors argue that, under the 1941 law creating PREPA, the court is required to appoint a receiver if requested by at least a quarter of stakeholders, a threshold these creditors easily meet. Standing in the creditors’ way, however, is the socalled automatic stay that bars creditors of PREPA from enforcing certain rights while the utility is in bankruptcy. The creditors argue in the court papers the stay should be lifted to avoid “irreparable harm. ”“PREPA’s bondholders face a profound threat to the value of their collateral” absent the lifting of the stay, they argue.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSKBN1A324H,Reuters,Neutral

Puerto Rico struggles to save historic buildings amid crisis,DANICA COTO,6/30/17,"Stained glass windows from the 16th century are broken. Porch railings from the 1700s are missing. Brick walls crumble inside the hall where Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the U.S. Puerto Rico’s prized historic buildings are falling apart as a debt crisis and enduring economic recession have slashed public and private funding for maintenance, repairs and restoration. Tourists are increasingly banned from visiting once-popular sites now in dangerous disrepair. Overall, nearly 40 key buildings in the metropolitan area are in danger of being lost, according to Andy Rivera, an architect who founded the Puerto Rico Historic Building Drawing Society. “It’s a shame these things are deteriorating, and nobody is calling attention to it,” he said. The majority of these buildings are in the historic part of Puerto Rico’s capital known as Old San Juan, founded in 1521 and governed by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. It is a top tourist attraction with its blue cobblestone streets, colorful homes and expansive ocean views. But dozens of historic buildings there are decaying. The exact number is unknown because the government hasn’t carried out structural evaluations of them in more than five years, said Carmen Marla Lopez, director of the historical heritage program at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. “Given our fiscal situation, a lot of people and even the government itself do not have enough money to intervene in all the properties it would like to,” she said. Many of the buildings are owned by the government of the U.S. territory, whose maintenance budgets have been cut along with most other spending at a moment when officials are trying to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt. Private and other non-governmental maintenance budgets also have been squeezed by a severe, long-lasting recession that has been aggravated by government cutbacks in jobs, pensions and general spending. As a result, authorities have closed several buildings and museums because they have decayed to the point where they pose a danger to the public, Rivera said. Among them is the bell tower of the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista in Old San Juan. Worshippers and tourists can visit the rest of the 16th century church, best known for housing the remains of Ponce de Leon. Other attractions also have been damaged: Church officials were forced to remove several broken stained glass windows and a huge, antique organ because it was filled with termites. The church’s walls are crumbling in many places and mold is clearly visible. A large sign at the cathedral’s entrance asks visitors to leave a donation to help finance the reconstruction project, although the extent of the damage and cost of the project is unclear. The Rev. Benjamin Perez, who helps oversee the project, did not return messages for comment. Also shuttered for safety reasons are an apothecary museum in a building from the 1700s and a historic theater, the Home of the Two Forecourts, built in the mid-1700s. “The balcony in the interior patio was going to collapse at any minute,” Lopez said. Safety concerns led to closure of the hall where Spain signed a historic deal turning Puerto Rico over to the U.S. government in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. One big concern is that the longer a building remains shuttered, the more it costs to restore, especially where a tropical climate speeds deterioration. That is one of the reasons officials have struggled to reopen the National Gallery, a renowned seaside museum that housed the largest collection of Puerto Rican paintings from the 1700s onward, as well as antique furniture and military artifacts. It closed in November 2013 amid concerns over restoration permits, and projected costs keep rising as budgets keep shrinking. “It’s going to take a lot of work to reopen because it’s been closed for several years,” Lopez said. “We’re evaluating its current condition.” When the agency said it did not have $35,000 to renovate a historic fort on the nearby island of Vieques, the local community and sponsors helped raise the money needed. Lopez said she envisions similar arrangements in the future. “We have to look for other ways given the economic crisis so we don’t lose these properties,” she said. “There are certainly serious concerns that these properties cannot be maintained.” Puerto Rico’s government in some cases has opted to sell or lease historic buildings to individuals or nonprofit groups in hopes they can finance restoration. A private university is remodeling a building that was once an iconic movie theater in Old San Juan. Rivera, the architect, said he understands the government cannot do it alone, but stressed there are other options. “Lack of money is no excuse,” he said. “Conservation is important so that the children of your children know where they came from.” ___ Danica Coto on Twitter: www.twitter.com/danicacoto",https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-caribbean-international-news-puerto-rico-2067b1636e5743e4b1efff7a8d2bfa3e,AP,Neutral
U.S. lawmaker troubled Puerto Rico board slow to approve $9 billion power deal,Nick Brown,6/15/17,"The chairman of the U.S. congressional committee that oversees Puerto Rico on Thursday said the bankrupt island’s federal oversight board was dragging its feet on approving a $9 billion power utility restructuring. The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin BaezUtah Republican Rob Bishop, who chairs the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, said the board’s inaction was “troubling” in a letter to board Chairman Jose Carrion, adding that the debt restructuring at Puerto Rico’s power authority, PREPA, was already greenlit by Congress. Bishop’s gripe is over a deal struck earlier this year between PREPA and its creditors to restructure some $9 billion of debt. PREPA’s financial woes are a microcosm of an economic crisis, marked by $70 billion in total debt, that has pushed Puerto Rico into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Negotiations between PREPA and its bondholders were rocky, lasting more than two years and running into a major roadblock when an initial version of the accord was rejected by Puerto Rico’s new governor. Now, the latest deal appears to be hitting a snag too, as the U.S. territory’s oversight panel, created by U.S. lawmakers to manage its finances, has yet to approve it. “It appears there is no consensus from the oversight board in favor of certifying” the deal, Bishop said. But Bishop argued the board has no right to review it. The 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA ,which originated in Bishop’s committee ,included language to keep preexisting compromises like PREPA’s out of the board’s reach. The board’s insistence on reviewing the deal is “outside the scope” of its powers, Bishop said, and could “result in severe, adverse effects for the island, including a dampening of the board’s ability to negotiate in good faith with creditors. ”Bishop and other lawmakers have supported the quick implementation of the PREPA deal, in large part because it was a compromise struck out of court. PROMESA allows Puerto Rico and its agencies to slash debts through bankruptcy, but Republican lawmakers, wary of massive cuts to bondholders, have tried to encourage outofcourt compromises. Under the PREPA deal, creditors would take repayment cuts of only 15 cents on the dollar, smaller than the hefty haircuts likely to face creditors of other Puerto Rican debt issuers now in bankruptcy.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSKBN1962O2,Reuters,Neutral
Stockton bankruptcy judge among five tapped to mediate Puerto Rico debt fights,Nick Brown,6/14/17,"The fivejudge team tapped to mediate a slew of thorny legal fights in Puerto Rico’s massive bankruptcy will include the judge who presided over Stockton, California’s 2012 bankruptcy and Puerto Ricanborn federal Judge Victor Marrero. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is presiding over the bankruptcy, revealed the mediation team in a court order on Wednesday. The group will be led by Judge Barbara Houser, the chief judge for the federal bankruptcy court in Dallas, and will include Judge Marrero, of the federal court in New York, and Judge Christopher Klein, the Sacramentobased federal bankruptcy judge who oversaw Stockton’s restructuring. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, of the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and Senior District Judge Nancy Atlas, of the U.S. federal court in Houston, will round out the team. Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory with $70 billion of debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, in May filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. The case also promises to be one of the messiest, as already several investors have begun staking competing claims to the island’s limited revenue sources. The biggest fight is between the two largest creditor factions: holders of $18 billion in general obligation debt, which carries a constitutional guarantee, and more than $17 billion of bonds issued by COFINA, Puerto Rico’s sales tax authority, backed by the tax revenue COFINA collects. Both groups say they have an ironclad claim on the COFINA revenue. Swain, in her order, said participation in mediation would be voluntary, but that all parties would “be required to engage in good faith in preliminary discussions with representatives of the mediation team. ”The team, in turn, would “develop a list of issues to be addressed. ”In addition to Stockton, Judge Klein is known for presiding over the 2014 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of that city’s Roman Catholic diocese. Judge Marrero, born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, earned his law degree in 1968 from Yale Law School and has been a judge since 1999.

Puerto Rico governor vows statehood push after referendum win,Nick Brown,6/12/17,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Monday said the island’s vote in favor of becoming a U.S. state, despite low voter turnout and widespread boycotts, was “a fair and open” process that U.S. Congress should act upon. A man holds a U.S. flag after the economically struggling U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico voted overwhelmingly on Sunday in favour of becoming the 51st state, in San Juan, Puerto Rico June 11, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin BaezAn islandwide referendum on Sunday favored statehood in a 97 percent landslide, though voter turnout reached just 23 percent as opponents of Governor Ricardo Rossello’s push to become a state boycotted the vote. The nonbinding plebiscite is not expected to sway the U.S. Congress, which would have to agree to make Puerto Rico a state. Currently a U.S. territory, the island is struggling with $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, and is not viewed as a priority in Washington. Rossello, who campaigned on a push for statehood, said in a telephone interview with  that he will go to the U.S. capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico into the union. “We will make sure this becomes an issue,” Rossello said. The vote comes at a critical time for Puerto Rico, whose hazy status ,which dates to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain ,has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis. Last month, the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its woes make statehood even more urgent, Rossello said. “Statehood brings stability, allows us to have fewer rulechanges from Congress, provides resources to our people,” he said. DIVIDED ISLANDSunday’s referendum, which cost Puerto Rico between $5 million and $7 million, according to government estimates, was the island’s fifth since 1967 ,and the third in which prostatehood sentiments triumphed, though none have moved Congress to act. “If the U.S. is going to go to Venezuela and Cuba and Afghanistan and push democracy abroad, they’ve got to do the same” with their own territories, he said. But Puerto Ricans are skeptical the island’s status will change. “This has all been a waste of time,” said taxi driver Felix Salasarar, 54, adding that federal lawmakers will “look at the voter turnout and say, ‘where’s the will of the people?’”Working against the governor may be a perception in Washington that Sunday’s vote was not fair. The U.S. Department of Justice in April called on Rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a U.S. territory. Rossello told  he made that decision because the territory option ,which Rossello equates to colonialism ,already lost in a previous status referendum, in 2012, making this year’s vote a choice between statehood and independence. The Justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of Puerto Ricans who favor territory status, prompting Rossello to add the territory option. But the Justice department never reviewed or approved the new language. To be sure, Sunday’s results do not reflect the true nature of Puerto Ricans’ views on statehood, which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not, based upon historical election results. Statehooder Rossello, for example, won his own election with just 42 percent of the vote. But that, the governor said, is how democracy works: “Everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who don’t,” he said. Carolina Santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments, said bankrupt Puerto Rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote. “Maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools,” she said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-vote-idUSKBN1931NG,Reuters,Neutral

Ricardo Rossello said Sunday that the island has sent a strong and clear message to U.S. Congress and the world. Nearly half a million votes were cast for statehood, more than 7,600 for free association/independence and nearly 6,700 for the current territorial status. The participation rate was nearly 23 percent with roughly 2.26 million registered voters. But many question the validity of the vote amid a low turnout and a boycott by several opposition parties.

Puerto Rico votes in favor of U.S. statehood amid low turnout,Tracy Rucinski,6/11/17,"The economically struggling U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico voted overwhelmingly on Sunday in favor of becoming the 51st state, although turnout was low and adding another star to the U.S. flag likely faces an uphill battle in Congress. GM invests $7 billion to rival EV competitors Divided Puerto Ricans vote on whether to become U.S. state01:12A government website for the nonbinding referendum, Puerto Rico’s fifth such plebiscite since 1967, showed 97 percent supported statehood. Only 23 percent of the 2. 2 million eligible voters participated in the vote. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned for statehood as the best avenue to boost future growth for the island, which has $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools and nearinsolvent pension and health systems. “From today going forward, the Federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico,” Rossello said in a statement. “It would be highly contradictory for Washington to demand democracy in other parts of the world, and NOT respond to the legitimate right to selfdetermination that was exercised today in the American territory of Puerto Rico,” he added. Puerto Rico’s hazy political status, dating back to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain, has contributed to the economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. “I voted for statehood,” Armando Abreu, a 74yearold retiree, said after voting. “Even if it’s still a long way off in the distance, it’s our only hope. ”Slideshow ( 12 images )Those in favor of statehood for the mainly Spanishspeaking Caribbean island hope the new status would put the territory on equal standing with the 50 U.S. states, giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for U.S. president. Under the current system, Puerto Rico’s 3. 5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote in presidential elections or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor. The U.S. government oversees policy and financial areas such as infrastructure, defense and trade. Rossello will ask Congress to respect the result, but Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington. ‘BOGUS PLEBISCITE’The island’s two main opposition parties boycotted the vote, which gave Puerto Ricans three options: becoming a U.S. state; remaining a territory; or becoming an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the United States. Puerto Rico’s former governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, said in a statement: “A contrived plebiscite fabricated an artificial majority for statehood by disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth supporters. ”Slideshow ( 12 images )Rather than heading to the polls, some 500 Puerto Ricans marched on the streets of San Juan, waving Puerto Rico’s flag and burning the American flag while chanting in support of independence. “This is a bogus plebiscite. Our future is independence. We need to be able to decide our own fate,” said Liliana Laboy, one of the organizers of the protest. Boycotters were also angry about the costly referendum at a time when over 400 schools have closed and many Puerto Ricans are struggling to make ends meet. Schools where voting took place were in poor condition, with cracked paint and barebones playgrounds. Puerto Rico spent an estimated $8 million on the campaign and election process, according to a government spokesman.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-vote-idUSKBN19204O,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico prepares to vote on political status amid crisis,DANICA COTO,6/9/17,"Puerto Rico’s governor is pushing ahead with his top campaign promise of trying to convert the U.S. territory into a state, holding a Sunday referendum to let voters send a message to Congress. His party has launched an aggressive ad campaign urging people to “demand respect” with their vote — to choose statehood so the island can obtain equal treatment from the federal government that some say would ease a 10-year economic recession that has spurred nearly half a million Puerto Ricans to flee to the U.S. mainland. While Puerto Rico is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes but receives less federal funding than U.S. states. Statehood supporters and some economists say this unequal treatment has contributed to the island’s deep economic crisis, which was largely driven by heavy borrowing and in part by the elimination of federal tax incentives. “It’s clear we need to change our course toward a new future,” said Puerto Rico Sen. Carmelo Rios, a member of the governor’s party. “Puerto Rico is at its most critical point in its modern history, where its political-economic model has collapsed, society is in a crisis, the government cannot sustain itself, and we have seen with much pain how our people leave us in search of a better chance of quality of life.” The referendum coincides with the 100th anniversary of U.S. citizenship being granted to Puerto Ricans, who are barred from participating in presidential elections and have a representative in Congress with limited voting powers. Voters will choose one of three options: statehood, free association/independence or the current territorial status. If a majority chooses “free association/independence,” Puerto Rico would hold another referendum in early October with those two options. Regardless of the referendum’s outcome, the U.S. government has final say on changes to Puerto Rico’s political status, and many believe a Republican-led Congress would not approve Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state. A recent survey by Gaither International found that more than 60 percent of people interviewed believed that solving the island’s status would ease Puerto Rico’s problems. A May 24-26 house-to-house poll published by local newspaper El Nuevo Dia found 52 percent of those interviewed favored statehood, compared with 17 percent for the status quo and 15 percent for free association/independence. It had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points. Gov. Ricardo Rossello this week signed a measure that would authorize him to choose two senators and five representatives and send them to Washington to demand statehood, a strategy Tennessee employed to join the union in the 18th century. “Our colonial status is unsustainable and has contributed to the current fiscal and economic crisis,” Rossello said. Puerto Rico has held four previous referendums on the issue. No clear majority emerged in the first three, with voters almost evenly divided between statehood and the status quo. During the last referendum in 2012, 54 percent said they wanted a status change. Sixty-one percent who answered a second question said they favored statehood, but nearly half a million voters left that question blank, leading many to claim the results were not legitimate. Critics question the timing of the newest referendum, coming about a month after Puerto Rico’s governor announced the island would enter a bankruptcy-like process to restructure part of its $73 billion public debt. “Pushing statehood under normal times would be difficult enough; to push while literally under bankruptcy court is absolutely ridiculous,” said Amilcar Barreto, a Northeastern University associate professor who focuses on Puerto Rico politics and identity. “There couldn’t be a worse time ... They really haven’t given much thought, perhaps out of desperation, on how that’s going to swing in Congress.” Three political parties in Puerto Rico are boycotting Sunday’s referendum, including the main opposition party. They question why the government is spending more than $5 million on the vote amid a crisis, and note that the U.S. Justice Department has not backed the referendum. A department spokesman told The Associated Press that the agency has not reviewed or approved the language on the ballot. Federal officials in April rejected an earlier version, in part because it did not include the territory’s current status as an option. Rossello’s administration added it and sent the ballot back for review, but the department said it needed more time and asked that the vote be postponed, which it wasn’t. Statehood opponents boycotting the referendum say they also want to preserve Puerto Rico’s cultural identity and retain more local control. If the island became a state, Puerto Ricans also would have to pay millions in federal taxes, said Manuel Calderon Cerame, vice president of the main opposition party’s youth wing. “Statehood is not an economic model. Statehood is a political model,” he said. “Ever since I was a kid, we’ve been told that the poorest state in the U.S. is Mississippi. I’m 28 years old now, and Mississippi is still the poorest state. There are no guarantees that statehood would represent an economic boost for Puerto Rico.” Even if there’s a clear winner on Sunday, nothing will change without U.S. government authorization, Barreto said. “It’s all in Congress’ hands,” he said. “I strongly suspect that regardless of the outcome, that Congress as a collective will probably just ignore the results of the plebiscite and after a week, pretend it didn’t even happen.”",https://apnews.com/980c87fda6d64672a65fe74f5bbb6680/Puerto-Rico-prepares-tovote-on-political-status-amid-crisis,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico retirees will get bankruptcy committee: U.S. Trustee,Nick Brown,5/19/17,"The U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog said on Friday it plans to appoint a committee of retirees in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy to negotiate for pensioners facing benefit cuts as part of the island’s debt restructuring. FILE PHOTO ,A protester holding a Puerto Rico's flag takes part in a march to improve healthcare benefits in San Juan, Puerto Rico, November 5, 2015. REUTERS/Alvin BaezPuerto Rico, carrying some $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, “clearly needs a retiree committee and sooner rather than later,” the office of the U.S. Trustee said in a filing in federal court in San Juan. Puerto Rico filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history earlier this month. In addition to its pension debt, the U.S. territory has around $70 billion in bond debt it cannot pay. While retiree committees are common in bankruptcies with big pension debts, the Trustee in Puerto Rico’s case took the rare step of announcing intentions to appoint a committee without waiting for a blessing from the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain. “The Trustee typically will refrain from exercising his discretion . . . to appoint an additional committee until the court has an opportunity to rule,” the filing said. “But this case is not like most cases. ”Puerto Rico’s biggest public pensions are almost 100 percent underfunded, a gap thought to be the largest statelevel pension hole in U.S. history. The federallyappointed board overseeing the island’s finances has called for cuts to pension benefits, saying they are necessary to pull the island out of a crisis marked by a 45 percent poverty rate, unemployment more than twice the U.S. average, and nearinsolvent public health systems. The Trustee said it expects to complete the solicitation process for the committee by June 16. At the island’s first bankruptcy hearing this week in San Juan, Robert Gordon, an attorney for an informal group comprising 91,000 retirees, argued “they have earned the right to participate in this process. ”The Trustee, however, stressed in its filing that Judge Swain should not grant Gordon’s group the right to serve as the official committee.

Puerto Rico's bankruptcy hearing marks reset of asset scramble,Daniel Bases,5/16/17,"Puerto Rico is due to embark on a bankruptcy process on Wednesday that could take years to resolve, as investors scramble to get the highest recovery on their bonds. The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Alvin BaezThe debt is still trading at elevated levels versus what the government has set aside for payment under its financial recovery plan, and creditors worry about whether they will be able to recoup at those prices. Whether they get that level of recovery is debatable, according to investors and analysts, as the U.S. territory seeks to restructure more than $70 billion in debt, from multiple agencies, and another near $45 billion in underfunded pension liabilities. “The 25 percent may be what the Commonwealth identified as a available to cover debt service but it doesn’t necessarily mean that will be the ultimate recovery,” said Shaun Burgess, portfolio manager and lead trader for Puerto Rico strategy at Sarasota, Floridabased Cumberland Advisors. Puerto Rico, with 3. 5 million U.S. citizens, has spent the last ten years in recession with debt piling up to pay for basic services. The poverty rate is at 45 percent, unemployment is at 11 percent and the population is shrinking as islanders emigrate to the mainland United States in search of a better life. Burgess, who owns insured Puerto Rican debt, did not want to speculate on the final recovery prices, or the potential losses for major mutual funds, but said negotiations could include lowering the coupon rates, reducing principal and extending maturity dates. “There isn’t enough information, especially as it relates to time frame and potential recoveries,” he said. Yet to be worked out is how an $800 million pot of money set aside in the government’s certified 10year fiscal recovery plan will be apportioned between competing claims including those of constitutionally backed general obligation debt (GO) and salestax backed bonds known as COFINA. That pot of money represents less than a quarter of what is needed to service debt annually. That question will ultimately be settled by U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the Southern District of New York when the bankruptcylike proceeding begins in a San Juan courtroom on Wednesday. Swain, appointed by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts on May 5th, is operating under the authority granted by the U.S. Congress, which passed a law last year known as PROMESA (Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act). PROMESA established a federal oversight board with the authority to negotiate the restructuring of the island’s debt. It includes a provision known as Title III that establishes a legal pathway, previously unavailable, for Puerto Rico to settle its obligations through a bankruptcylike process. Normally, GO debt is the most senior in a municipality’s capital structure and the first to be paid. COFINA creditors are fighting to ensure its revenue stream doesn’t get diverted to pay other debt. “Clearly we don’t know what to expect, but it is going to be a lengthy and tortuous process. This is going to take longer than Detroit,” said Mikhail Foux, municipal research director at Barclays Capital in New York. Detroit’s case took 18 months. “I would assume the final solution should also address the pensions because if you are bondholder why would you take a haircut knowing the pension liability question could just send you back to square one again,” he said. (To view a timeline graphic of trade price for Puerto Rico debt, click reut. rs/2qpLk1P)UNPRECEDENTEDPuerto Rico’s bankruptcy dwarfs Detroit’s, the previous record holder for municipal bankruptcy at $18 billion in debt and obligations that was ultimately reduced by $7 billion. “The main takeaway I have from the experience of Detroit or GM (General Motors) is that politics trumps contracts. I expect the final result to involve big haircuts, low coupons and long maturities for bondholders, and it probably doesn’t matter if its GO’s or COFINAS,” said Robert Rauch, senior partner and portfolio manager at emerging market asset manager Gramercy. Currently Puerto Rico's benchmark general obligation debt, an 8 percent coupon bond maturing in 2035, last traded at a bid price of 60, according to Thomson  data. 74514LE86=MSRB“Current prices reflect the fact that the muni market doesn’t permit shorting. As long as the current core of bondholders is supporting the market it won’t go down to a level that reflects realistic recoveries,” said Rauch, whose firm specializes in emerging markets and distressed debt. COFINA bondholders were the first to sue the government after the freeze on creditor litigation under PROMESA expired at Midnight May 1st. They accuse Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rossello and other officials of angling to repurpose the tax revenue earmarked to pay COFINA debt. “If COFINA is pierced, many people would say it is oneoff situation and not precedent setting. But it could have some effect on other municipal credits,” Foux said. Senior COFINA debt carrying a 5. 25 percent coupon maturing in 2057 was bid at 57 with a yield of 9. 39 percent on Tuesday. 74529JAR6=MSRBThe 6 percent 2042 subordinated COFINA bond has steadied, last bid at 23. 71 with a yield rising to 25. 5 percent 74529JHN8=MSRB.

Puerto Rico government bank reaches wind-down deal with creditors,Nick Brown,5/15/17,"Debtladen Puerto Rico announced on Monday that the Government Development Bank, once the primary fiscal agent for the U.S. territory, has reached a liquidation deal with its creditors, avoiding a protracted bankruptcy. FILE PHOTO: The Government Development Bank (GDB) is seen in San Juan, November 30, 2015. /Alvin Baez/File PhotoThe agreement would be executed through a socalled Title VI proceeding under PROMESA, the federal rescue law for Puerto Rico, according to a statement from Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office. That would avoid a Title III bankruptcy. GDB is a microcosm of Puerto Rico’s historic economic crisis, which is marked by an untenable $70 billion debt load, 45 percent poverty rate, and nearinsolvent public health and pension systems. The bank’s assets will be split between two separate entities, according to a term sheet made public on Monday. The first, holding $5. 3 billion in GDB assets, would issue three tranches of debt with different protections in exchange for varying principal reductions. Beneficiaries would include municipal depositors and bondholders like Avenue Capital Management, Brigade Capital Management, and Fir Tree Partners. The second entity, funded with public entity loans and $50 million in cash, would benefit all other depositors. Rafael Rojo, a spokesman for a group of small bondholders in Puerto Rico, said the deal could mean losses of up to 45 percent for some bondholders. But “before we are bondholders, we are Puerto Ricans, and we recognize the circumstances that Puerto Rico faces,” Rojo said in the statement issued by Rossello’s office. Puerto Rico’s government as well as its sales tax authority, COFINA, are in bankruptcy under Title III of PROMESA, with initial court hearings scheduled for Wednesday in San Juan. Other island agencies are undergoing debt restructurings out of court. GDB’s plan represents an end to what was once the equivalent of a central bank in charge of holding deposits from government agencies and municipalities. Puerto Rico’s federal financial oversight board last month approved a plan to wind down the bank, which had been a shell entity since the island’s former governor declared a state of emergency in April 2016. GDB defaulted on $422 million of debt the following month. “This agreement is an example of the government regaining the credibility it had lost over the past few years,” Rossello said in the statement on Monday.

Puerto Rico bondholders in for bumpy bankruptcy ride,Nick Brown,5/4/17,"If Puerto Rico’s recordsetting bankruptcy follows the template of other municipal restructurings, general obligation bondholders may be in for a long ride, despite constitutional guarantees on their debt. GM invests $7 billion to rival EV competitors Rough ride for Puerto Rico bondholders01:45The federal financial oversight board for Puerto Rico on Wednesday pushed the U.S. commonwealth into a courtsanctioned restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy, known as Title III. Similar filings for the island’s public agencies could be coming soon. Puerto Rico will use the court processes to restructure much of its $70 billion debt load and $49 billion in pension liabilities. This dwarfs Detroit’s 2013 filing, which at $18 billion in bond and pension debt was until now the largestever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. The island’s constitution guarantees the debt of GO, or General Obligation, bondholders, while other debt, known as COFINA, is backed by revenue streams from tax proceeds. But in past bankruptcies, that has not meant much. In five of six recent public bankruptcies in which the debtor defaulted on bonds, pensioners walked away with full recovery, while bondholders took haircuts, according to data from Moody’s Investors Service. Among those settlements, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, bondholders took a reduction in the value of their investments by an average of about 25 cents on the dollar, according to Moody’s, while in Stockton, California, the haircut was 50 percent. Even in Detroit, where pensioners suffered losses of about 18 percent, bondholders on average took home only 25 cents on the dollar, the Moody’s data shows. “If the market hasn’t taken this dynamic into account by now, you can imagine they will after Puerto Rico, given its enormous scale,” said bankruptcy expert Drew Dawson, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. Among Puerto Rico creditors, GO and COFINA debt are viewed as the two safest bets for decent recoveries. GO holders seemed to have an advantage out of court, where constitutional debt is seen as sacrosanct. Puerto Rico offered a restructuring that favored GO bonds over COFINAs. [L1N1I109O]But the opposite may be true in bankruptcy, which prioritizes debt backed by a revenue stream, like COFINA, ahead of unsecured debt. FILE PHOTO: A person carries a Puerto Rican national flag during a protest against the government's austerity measures as Puerto Rico faces a deadline on Monday to restructure its $70 billion debt load or open itself up to lawsuits from creditors, in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 1, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez“Bankruptcy totally changes the priority for those two bonds,” said George Schultze, hedge fund manager and head of Schultze Asset Management, which does not hold Puerto Rican debt. Moody’s has rated the commonwealth’s GO and COFINA debt on equal footing, forecasting recoveries for both between 65 and 80 cents on the dollar, and ahead of debt from Puerto Rican agencies like the Government Development Bank, which it sees as recovering less than 35 cents. “There is no precedent to really resolve which one is the stronger between GO and COFINA,” said Tim Blake, a managing director at Moody’s, noting that Title III was uniquely created under last year’s Puerto Rico rescue law, PROMESA. Dawson said it is a tough call, but negotiating leverage “seems to have shifted, in the context of bankruptcy, to favor COFINA. ”GO holders, to be sure, could try to challenge the legality of COFINA’s lien on the tax revenues. But contrasting statements between COFINA and GO holders may give a sense of each side’s confidence in the bankruptcy process. Susheel Kirpalani, a lawyer for a COFINA investor group, on Wednesday called the filing “sound public policy. ” All along, COFINA holders have favored the bankruptcy route. But Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer for a GO bond group, said “the economy of Puerto Rico will be put on hold for years” in a bankruptcy. CREDITOR LEVERAGECreditors may have some leverage to petition a judge to toss the case, arguing that the oversight board did not meet PROMESA’s requirements to file a Title III. PROMESA requires goodfaith negotiations toward an outofcourt deal before any filing, as well as to establish “procedures necessary to deliver” audited financial statements for any entity entering bankruptcy. Some Puerto Rican agencies still have not published such statements, and creditors have griped for months that the oversight board has not done enough to encourage compromises outside of court. “We would agree there is a case to be made here” for dismissing the case, Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson told investors in a note on Wednesday. Rosenberg said the oversight board blocked his group’s lastminute restructuring deal with the island in order to push it into bankruptcy, a claim a board spokesman quickly denied. Another key issue that remains in limbo for debt holders is what the island defines as an “essential service. ” Under Puerto Rico’s constitution, it cannot cut repayments to GO creditors except to maintain essential services. All told, “this will be a field day for litigation, including over who has priority and whether the bankruptcy is even authorized,” said Schultze. “It could even go to the Supreme Court. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-analysis-idUSKBN18022T,Reuters,Neutral
Factbox - Puerto Rico vs Detroit: What's different?,Reuters Staff,5/3/17,"Puerto Rico on Wednesday filed for a form of bankruptcy protection, bumping aside Detroit for the title of the largest municipal insolvency case in U.S. history. While the Caribbean Island and MoTown share comparable histories of economic malaise, ballooning debt and fiscal mismanagement at the heart of their distress, several important differences distinguish the two proceedings. Here are some key distinctions and similarities:SIZE OF THE PROBLEMPuerto Rico’s overall debt burden is nearly seven times larger than Detroit’s was when it entered bankruptcy. The Motor City had $18 billion of debt, including outstanding bonds and unfunded liabilities for its worker pensions and retiree healthcare, when it filed for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in July 2013. By contrast, Puerto Rico is struggling with a public debt burden totaling $74 billion of outstanding bonds and $49 billion owed for pensions. DIFFERENT KIND OF ‘BANKRUPTCY’Detroit’s case occurred under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which is reserved for state and local governments. Puerto Rico, as a U.S. territory, is barred from filing for the same kind of creditor protection, but Title III of the socalled PROMESA law, enacted by Congress last year, allowed it to pursue a courtsupervised, bankruptcylike proceeding to restructure its obligations. Detroit exited Chapter 9 in December 2014 after a 17month restructuring that allowed it to shed about $7 billion of debt. Bondholders and bond insurers reached agreements that resulted in recoveries of 74 percent for unlimitedtax general obligation bonds and 34 percent for limitedtax GO bonds. It is unclear at this stage how much Puerto Rico’s creditors can expect to recover. POVERTY AND FLIGHTHeading into bankruptcy, both Detroit and Puerto Rico were plagued with population declines, high unemployment rates, sinking housing values and a large portion of local residents living below the poverty line. Chronically late financial audits were common for both, and severe budget problems adversely affected the delivery of government services. LOSS OF LOCAL CONTROLBoth Puerto Rico and Detroit had been effectively stripped of local control over their finances by the time each sought protection from creditors. Detroit’s finances had been turned over to an emergency manager tapped by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. Kevyn Orr, a corporate bankruptcy attorney from Jones Day, retained daytoday control over city operations until the city emerged from bankruptcy. Under PROMESA, Congress imposed an oversight board charged with fixing Puerto Rico’s finances and devising an economic recovery plan. It also armed it with the use of a courtsupervised process to restructure the territory’s debt. DEFAULTSBoth bankruptcy filings followed bond defaults. Detroit’s emergency manager skipped a payment on $1. 43 billion of pension bonds in June 2013. As of Sept. 30, Puerto Rico and its various bond issuing authorities had missed nearly $1. 5 billion in debt service payments. WHERE’S THE ART?Perhaps the most unique element of Detroit’s bankruptcy was the role played by its local art museum. The Detroit Institute of Arts was home to cityowned works from masters such as Claude Monet, Henri Matisse and Pieter Bruegel that were at risk of being sold to help settle Detroit’s debt. A socalled grand bargain involving $816 million pledged by foundations, the institute and the state of Michigan saved the art from sale, while providing money for pensions.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-detroit-fa-idUSKBN17Z2LT,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico files for biggest ever U.S. local government bankruptcy,Nick Brown,5/3/17,"Puerto Rico announced a historic restructuring of its public debt on Wednesday, touching off what may be the biggest bankruptcy ever in the $3. 8 trillion U.S. municipal bond market. GM invests $7 billion to rival EV competitors Puerto Rico files biggest ever U.S. local government bankruptcy01:14While it was not immediately clear just how much of Puerto Rico’s $70 billion of debt would be included in the bankruptcy filing, the case is sure to dwarf Detroit’s insolvency in 2013. The move comes a day after several major creditors sued Puerto Rico over defaults its bonds. Bankruptcy may not immediately change the daytoday lives of Puerto Rico’s people, 45 percent of whom live in poverty, but it may lead to future cuts in pensions and worker benefits, and possibly a reduction in health and education services. The island’s economy has been in recession for nearly 10 years, with an unemployment rate of about 11. 0 percent, and the population has fallen by about 10 percent in the past decade. The bankruptcy process will also give Puerto Rico the legal ability to impose drastic discounts on creditor recoveries, but could also spook investors and prolong the island’s lack of access to debt markets. BANKRUPTCY UNDER PROMESA LAWThe debt restructuring petition was filed by Puerto Rico’s financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, and was made under Title III of last year’s U.S. Congressional rescue law known as PROMESA. The Title III provision allows for a court debt restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy protection. Puerto Rico is barred from a traditional municipal bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. code. The filing includes only Puerto Rico’s central government, which owes some $18 billion in debt backed by the island’s constitution. On paper, it does not include $17 billion of sales taxbacked debt, known as COFINA debt, or debt from other agencies. Related CoverageFactbox ,Puerto Rico vs Detroit: What's different?But those debts are likely to be pulled into the bankruptcy, or included in separate bankruptcy proceedings in coming days, Elias Sanchez, an adviser to Governor Ricardo Rossello, told  on Wednesday. Puerto Rico’s massive pension debts will also likely get restructured in the bankruptcy. “Title III was especially compelled by the commonwealth’s need to restructure $49 billion of pension liabilities,” the oversight board said in Wednesday’s filing. BIGGER BANKRUPTCY THAN DETROITThe previous largest U.S. public bankruptcy, Detroit’s in 2013, covered some $18 billion in debt. The city was able to reach an agreed debt restructuring with stakeholders, in part by soliciting huge contributions from philanthropic foundations so it did not need to sell the city’s art collection. But “unlike Detroit, there isn’t billions of unencumbered artwork to fund a restructuring” in Puerto Rico, said David Tawil, whose fund, Maglan Capital, held Puerto Rico general obligation debt but has since sold it. The legal proceeding does not mean negotiations toward a compromise must stop, Governor Rossello said in a statement on Wednesday. “It is my hope that the Government’s Title III proceedings will accelerate the negotiation process,” the governor said in the statement. Rossello’s fiscal plan for the island, approved by the oversight board in March, forecasts Puerto Rico having only $800 million a year to pay debt, less than a quarter of what it owes. The low figure alienated creditors and negotiations toward an outofcourt restructuring foundered. Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer for the general obligation bondholders, criticized the Title III filing, saying in a statement a consensual deal could have been reached. Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello addresses the audience during a meeting of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico at the Convention Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico March 31, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez “Just as a deal was within reach [on Tuesday], we understand that the oversight board intervened to block it,” Rosenberg said in a statement. “For months, the oversight board has made every effort to sabotage consensual negotiations. ”Francisco Cimadevilla, a spokesman for the board, denied the allegation, saying in an interview, “I can understand that might be a narrative on the other side, but it’s just not the case. ”Conversely, Susheel Kirpalani, a lawyer for COFINA bondholders, called bankruptcy “sound public policy,” saying in a statement it “enables Puerto Rico to freeze numerous lawsuits” and “maintain essential services. ”Analysts and experts agreed the case is likely to take time. “It will be an orderly process that should be better for creditors in the aggregate than a chaotic and uncertain period involving proliferating lawsuits,” said Moody’s Investor Services analyst Ted Hampton. Some expect creditors to challenge the filing, arguing the board did not meet requirements under PROMESA to conduct good faith negotiations out of court. “We would agree there is a case to be made here,” said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson, who follows Puerto Rico.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-idUSKBN17Z1UC,Reuters,Neutral
Sales tax creditors kick off likely wave of lawsuits against Puerto Rico,Nick Brown,5/2/17,"Holders of Puerto Rican sales taxbacked debt sued the U.S. territory in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, alleging its debtcutting plans violate the U.S. Constitution and kicking off a likely deluge of lawsuits against the ailing island. The complaint, filed in federal court in San Juan, accuses Puerto Rico’s leadership of impairing contractual rights of socalled COFINA bondholders, whose debt is backed by sales tax revenue, and trying to take their property in what they say are violations of the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. With $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and nearinsolvent public health and pension systems, a torrent of litigation could force Puerto Rico into a socalled Title III proceeding ,an incourt debtcutting process similar to U.S. bankruptcy. Midnight Tuesday morning marked the end of a freeze on creditor litigation under last year’s federal rescue law known as PROMESA, designed to encourage Puerto Rico and its federal financial oversight board to negotiate debtcutting agreements with creditors. With no deals reached, the expiration of the freeze opened the floodgates for stakeholders to take Puerto Rico to court, in hopes of blocking Governor Ricardo Rossello’s plan to impose drastic repayment cuts. The COFINA plaintiffs ,which include local COFINA holder Jose Rodriguez Perello, as well as hedge funds like Cyrus Capital Partners LP and Tilden Park Capital Management ,accuse Puerto Rico, Rossello and other officials of angling to repurpose the tax revenue earmarked to pay COFINA debt. The plaintiffs accuse Puerto Rico of taking their property “without just compensation or due process in violation of rights protected under the United States and Puerto Rico Constitutions. ”They cite as evidence a law signed by Rossello on Saturday that would give the government authority to redirect sales tax revenue into Puerto Rico’s general fund as part of a debt restructuring. Puerto Rico “must not be allowed to continue to breach its constitutional and contractual obligations at will,” the lawsuit said. The complaint asks the court to block Rossello from implementing a fiscal turnaround blueprint, approved by the oversight board in March, which has been the bane of island creditors. The blueprint forecasts that Puerto Rico will have only $800 million a year to pay its debt, less than a quarter of what it owes, auguring big haircuts for all bondholders. Litigation could spur the oversight board to push Puerto Rico into Title III, created as part of PROMESA. That would protect the island from lawsuits and give it more legal sway to impose the kinds of contractual alterations the COFINA group is accusing it of undertaking illegally out of court. Many experts and people involved in talks see Title III as an eventual certainty, though timing is uncertain. Tuesday’s lawsuit comes on the heels of a restructuring offer from Rossello’s administration on Saturday that would have favored Puerto Rico’s general obligation bondholders, whose debt is guaranteed by the island’s constitution. The plan would have seen GO holders recover as much as 77 cents on the dollar, while COFINA holders would have recouped just 58 cents. Other defendants in the lawsuit include Elias Sanchez, Rossello’s liaison to the oversight board; Gerardo Portela, director of Puerto Rico’s fiscal agent, known as AAFAF; and AAFAF itself.

U.S. Congress to give Puerto Rico short-term Medicaid help,Robin Respaut,5/1/17,"Ailing Puerto Rico would receive $295 million in Medicaid funding from the federal government as part of the U.S. Congress’ spending plan to avert a government shutdown, Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Monday. A worker takes off U.S and Puerto Rican flag after rally of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 16, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin BaezRossello said in a statement in Spanish that he was “grateful” for the addition in the spending bill reached late Sunday night. The full House of Representatives and Senate must approve the bipartisan pact, though prompt passage was expected this week. Puerto Rico’s public health system is nearly insolvent, a key driver of emigration that has decimated the U.S. territory’s population as it wrestles with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and unemployment twice the U.S. average. The island faces a deadline at midnight Monday to negotiate a debtcutting agreement with creditors, or open itself up to lawsuits over debt defaults. It could also file for a modified version of U.S. bankruptcy to protect itself from such litigation. One creditor, who owns insured Puerto Rican bonds, said the proposal was “not even close to a good proposal. “Not just lowball but also not a well constructed proposal,” said Sean Burgess, portfolio manager and lead trader for Puerto Rico strategy at Sarasota, Floridabased Cumberland Advisors. BANKRUPTCY?The island’s aggressive lobbying for federal healthcare funding in Washington is seen as a possible detractor to filing bankruptcy, which would not garner sympathy from Congressional Republicans who opposed the incourt restructuring provision in last year’s Puerto Rico rescue law, PROMESA. The $295 million will help fund the island’s Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, which starts July 1, and enable Puerto Rico to contract with managed care health insurance companies that administer the Medicaid program. Without the money, the island would have to run the Medicaid program on its own, a massive undertaking that Puerto Rico is not equipped to do, said island Health Secretary Dr. Rafael RodríguezMercado. But Puerto Rico will still need an additional $300 million to fund its entire Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, RodríguezMercado told  in an interview on Monday. He hopes that money will come from the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in September. Puerto Rico’s $2. 76 billion Medicaid budget has been funded in part by a onetime pool of money provided to U.S. territories under the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. That money is expected to run out by the end of 2017, triggering what island officials call the “Medicaid cliff” — the return to a federal funding cap of $321 million for Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program. U.S. territories receive proportionately less federal Medicaid reimbursement than U.S. states. Prior to Obamacare, Puerto Rico partially funded its Medicaid budget through bonds, exacerbating the island’s debt crisis. In recent weeks, Governor Ricardo Rossello has been lobbying to boost Puerto Rico’s healthcare funding, warning that Washington’s failure to do so would leave some 900,000 people without health coverage.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-healthcare-idUSKBN17X285,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico bondholders shun island's debt-cutting offer,Nick Brown,4/29/17,"Puerto Rico’s government presented a debt restructuring offer late on Friday that could repay as much as 77 percent of general obligation (GO) bonds and 58 percent of taxbacked bonds, but both bondholder groups quickly rejected it early on Saturday. The plan comes ahead of a Monday deadline to reach a debtcutting agreement before creditors can sue Puerto Rico over defaults. The U.S. territory, shouldering $70 billion in debt it cannot pay, could also file an incourt debt workout akin to U.S. bankruptcy. The island’s largest and highestpriority debt classes, accounting for more than half the total, are GO debt guaranteed by Puerto Rico’s constitution, and socalled COFINA debt, backed by sales tax revenue. Both groups believe their legal protections to be sacrosanct, and are litigating against each other for top priority. Puerto Rico’s proposal would appear to treat GO debt more favorably, threatening COFINA holders with much smaller recoveries if they reject the plan. Under its proposal, Puerto Rico would issue $16. 75 billion of new senior bonds and $10 billion in “cash flow bonds,” essentially a growth bond, payable only if the island exceeds fiscal targets. GO holders would get $9. 8 billion of the senior bonds, recouping them a guaranteed 52 cents on the dollar, as well as $4. 7 billion of the conditional cash flow bond, which could up their recoveries to 77 cents. COFINA holders, meanwhile, would get $6. 9 billion of the senior bond and $3. 3 billion of the cash flow bond ,a recovery of up to 58 percent ,but only if they accept the deal. Otherwise, Puerto Rico would repay senior COFINA holders with $450 million in shortterm notes, while junior COFINA holders would get nothing. Matt Rodrigue, a financial adviser to senior COFINA holders, called the plan “absurd,” saying in an interview it disregards the priority of senior COFINA holders over junior ones, and could threaten the wellbeing of average Puerto Ricans because COFINA debt is widely held by locals. “This is a misfire” by Puerto Rico’s government and its advisers, Rodrigue said. Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer for a key GO bondholder group, said in a statement the plan was “not a credible starting point for negotiations. ”Debt from Puerto Rican public agencies, like its highway and infrastructure authorities, would recover less than 30 cents on the dollar under the plan, and only in the form of conditional cash flow bonds.

Healthcare battle may delay Title III bankruptcy for Puerto Rico,Nick Brown,4/26/17,"An adviser to Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Wednesday the distressed U.S. territory would not necessarily file for bankruptcy if it failed to reach a debt restructuring deal with creditors before Monday’s negotiating deadline. Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello addresses the audience during a meeting of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico at the Convention Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico March 31, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez “It depends on legal actions, if (creditors) go after our officials,” Elias Sanchez, Rossello’s liaison to Puerto Rico’s federal financial oversight board, told  at an event in Washington where Rossello spoke. “Maybe, but maybe not, too. ”Sanchez’s comments were the latest indication Puerto Rico’s leadership does not view bankruptcy as the immediate certainty that many experts and people involved in the talks expect. Under the federal Puerto Rico rescue law, PROMESA, Puerto Rico has until Monday to negotiate with stakeholders on a plan to reduce its crushing $70 billion debt load, or else open itself to lawsuits from creditors. There may be key political reasons for Rossello to delay bankruptcy until the end of the fiscal year on June 30 — even if forbearance efforts fail, and the island must defend a swarm of lawsuits in the short term. Bankruptcy could sabotage Rossello’s toppriority efforts to secure federal funding for the island’s nearinsolvent Medicaid system, the federal health insurance system for the poor. Sanchez previously voiced wariness about the unpredictability of a court process, and  reported last week the island was urging creditors to sign a deal to extend the Monday deadline. To be sure, the island could seek to enter a Title III bankruptcy at any time. It is the federal oversight board, not the governor, that makes the final call on doing so. “The costbenefit analysis (of delaying) makes sense,” said David Tawil, whose fund, Maglan Capital, traded out of its positions in Puerto Rican debt. “It’s only two months. ”With talks going nowhere as the deadline nears, filing a socalled Title III proceeding under PROMESA ,an incourt debt workout, akin to U.S. bankruptcy ,is seen as a way for Puerto Rico to protect itself from lawsuits, and arm itself with legal sway to impose harsh repayment cuts. But Republican lawmakers in Washington, already inclined to view healthcare funding as a bailout, would be even harder pressed to agree to Medicaid assistance for an island already slashing its debt in court, said a creditor source familiar with lobbying efforts. That could change if Puerto Rico secures funding before Monday. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that Democrats were angling for a Puerto Rico healthcare provision in a massive spending bill to fund the federal government through Sept. 30. On Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump expressed his disapproval for the plan in a tweet, stating: “Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars. Sad!”Another rationale for delaying bankruptcy: an islandwide plebiscite on June 11 asking Puerto Ricans to choose between U.S. statehood and independence. Although the referendum is not expected to resonate with federal lawmakers, Rossello, a statehood proponent, nonetheless may be loath to hurt his side’s chances by being associated with a bankruptcy.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-idUSKBN17T064,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico mediation devolves into war of words, deal still elusive",Nick Brown,4/21/17,"A war of words rather than talk of reconciliation is the latest indication that Puerto Rico and its creditors are getting nowhere fast in their negotiations to restructuring the island’s $70 billion in debt before mediation is due to end on Friday. A group of general obligation debtholders accused the government on Wednesday of breaking confidentiality rules after Elias Sanchez, a close adviser to Governor Ricardo Rossello, said Puerto Rico was waiting for creditors to make a restructuring offer. Creditors issued a statement saying the offense “befits a government getting comfortable in default. ”Rossello, through a lawyer, fired back the same day with a letter to the island’s federally appointed financial oversight board, saying Sanchez “was simply reiterating” the government’s desire “to receive constructive proposals from creditors. ”Puerto Rico has until May 1 to reach a debtreduction deal under a financial rescue law dubbed PROMESA, or enter an incourt restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy. Far from discussing how to split up Puerto Rico’s limited financial pot, parties are seen struggling to agree on the size of the pot in the first place. The island’s fiscal turnaround plan, approved last month by the oversight board, projects $800 million a year available to pay debt, less than quarter of what Puerto Rico owes in next fiscal year. In this week’s mediation, creditors are discussing how much that number would have to move to get them to the table, said creditorside sources, who declined to be named because talks are private. One source pegged the figure around $1. 3 billion; another said about $1. 8 billion. “How can we negotiate when we haven’t even got past the deficiencies with the fiscal plan?” said a third. Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 GO bond price has plunged since approval of the turnaround plan, which forecasts bigger haircuts than creditors expected. NEW NORMALThe dramatic discord is at least partly rooted in the elephantine gap between investors’ expectations for Puerto Rico’s oversight board, and its reality. Creditors began lobbying for the board after Rossello’s predecessor, the leftofcenter Alejandro Garcia Padilla, called Puerto Rico’s debt “unpayable” in 2015, and later pushed a plan to slash repayments by about half. Creditors got what they wanted: In mid2016, with restructuring talks dead, U.S. Congress created the board through PROMESA. In January, the moderate Rossello replaced the populist Garcia Padilla in the governor’s mansion. Creditor enthusiasm for the changes turned to shellshock, however, when the board in January began pushing debt cuts even more draconian than Garcia Padilla’s. “The board has been the biggest disappointment,” a creditor source told  in March. One government official said Rossello felt pigeonholed by the board, forced to either push biggerthanexpected cuts, or resist the board’s projections and be viewed as having no plan. Others see Rossello as using the board as a political cover for drastic cuts. “That’s exactly what the board is for,” said one of the creditor sources. One logistical challenge to a deal is how to recoup upside for creditors if Puerto Rico grows. In a corporate bankruptcy, bondholders can take a company’s equity. The closest municipal analog might be socalled growth bonds, with payouts dependent on future growth. But two creditor sources told  they do not want growth bonds, which they see as too hard to enforce in a municipal setting. “How do you ever decide when a municipality is in the money?” one of the sources said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-restructuring-idUSL1N1HS1LS,Reuters,Neutral
Exclusive: Puerto Rico government pushing forbearance deal in creditor talks - sources,Nick Brown,4/21/17,"Lawyers for Puerto Rico’s government are drafting a forbearance agreement that could allow the U.S. territory to avoid invoking bankruptcy protections in the shortterm, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions revealed to  on Friday. Puerto Rico and its creditors wrapped up roughly a week’s worth of mediated talks in New York, aimed at striking a deal to restructure much of the $70 billion in debt the island cannot pay. Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. It remains unclear if creditors would support such an offer to extend talks past a May 1 deadline to reach an agreement. After that date, Puerto Rico could face lawsuits from creditors or seek a courtsanctioned restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy, a provision of the 2016 rescue law known as PROMESA. One of the sources said a government attorney with O’Melveny & Myers informed some creditors the government’s legal team would circulate a draft forbearance agreement, and would be in touch in the coming week about scheduling new mediation talks.

"Puerto Rico governor, bondholders divided on PREPA deal",Nick Brown,3/22/17,"Puerto Rico’s governor told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday the island’s struggling power utility, PREPA, could undergo an incourt restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy if a consensual deal with creditors cannot be achieved. Governor Ricardo Rossello (L) talks with reporters after a speech in San Juan, Puerto Rico, March 9, 2017.  REUTERS/Nick BrownGovernor Ricardo Rossello said at a U.S. House Natural Resources subcommittee hearing his administration would prefer a consensual deal to bankruptcy, as lawmakers questioned him about delays in completing a $9 billion restructuring at PREPA. The hearing showcased growing discord between Rossello’s administration and PREPA’s creditors, which seemed to concern the committee in charge of leading Congress’ response to Puerto Rico’s ongoing crisis. PREPA and its creditors reached a tentative debt restructuring in December 2015, before Rossello took office, under which bondholders accepted 15 percent cuts to repayment in exchange for new bonds backed by an added charge on customer bills. Rather than rubberstamp that deal when he took office in January 2017, as many had predicted, Rossello said he would seek new terms. On Monday, his administration made public a revised offer to creditors. “If PREPA was pushed into (bankruptcy), do you expect that outcome would be better for Puerto Rico?” asked Representative Doug LaMalfa, a Republican from California. Rossello replied that “I champion and value” consensual renegotiation efforts, but that “doesn’t take a back seat” to seeking the best terms for PREPA. The utility is seen as a bellwether for Rossello’s approach to restructuring $70 billion in public debt that is pushing Puerto Rico’s economy toward collapse. The island has a 45 percent poverty rate and nearinsolvent public health and pension systems. Rossello campaigned in 2016 on compromising with bondholders, so his approach on PREPA has worried investors. At Wednesday’s hearing, the governor said the existing deal could hurt consumers because of the added charge on invoices. Stephen Spencer, an adviser to PREPA creditors, fought that notion, testifying that the charge is smaller than the costs customers would bear if PREPA did not restructure its debt or modernize operations. “Without a deal, PREPA faces a liquidity crisis or a rate hike,” Spencer said. But Puerto Rico’s federallyappointed fiscal oversight board supports Rossello’s effort to tweak the deal, in part because the concessions it seeks from PREPA creditors are much smaller than the ones likely to be pushed on other Puerto Rico investors, board member Ana Matosantos testified on Wednesday. Under a fiscal turnaround blueprint approved by the board on March 13, Puerto Rico will have $800 million annually to pay debt, just 21 percent of what it owes next fiscal year. A forbearance agreement at PREPA, which keeps creditors from suing while sides negotiate, expires March 31. Rossello said he supports extending it, but it was unclear if creditors share that willingness. “We have an execu table deal” already, Spencer said when asked whether creditors were open to renegotiating. KBW Inc analyst Chas Tyson said in a Wednesday note that “Creditors were visibly frustrated. ”“The body language of the hearing participants indicated there is still a wide distance between” Rossello and PREPA creditors, Tyson said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSKBN16T23J,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board approves revised government turnaround plan,Nick Brown,3/13/17,"Puerto Rico’s federal oversight board voted unanimously on Monday to certify the government’s fiscal turnaround plan, on the condition it be amended to eliminate Christmas bonuses, impose employee furloughs, and further reduce pension spending. Governor Ricardo Rossello (L) talks with reporters after a speech in San Juan, Puerto Rico, March 9, 2017.  REUTERS/Nick Brown The plan, a cornerstone of the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, will serve as the baseline for looming restructuring talks with holders of some $70 billion in debt that has pushed the U.S. territory to the brink of economic collapse. The government can avoid some of the austerity measures, which have sparked protest among Puerto Ricans, if it presents alternative costsaving measures by April 30, the board said. PROMESA required Governor Ricardo Rossello to present a turnaround blueprint that would require signoff by the board. The board rejected an initial draft last week, saying it relied on “overly optimistic” economic projections. The latest version rolled back those numbers, boosting the island’s 10year projected funding gap to $67 billion from $56 billion, and contemplating $39. 6 billion in new cash flows from spending cuts and revenue initiatives, up from $33. 8 billion in the last plan. The new version forecasts the island would have $800 million a year to service debt, down from $1. 2 billion in the draft. “The new plan is modestly worse than the old plan for creditors, as it implies larger haircuts,” Puerto Rico credit analyst Chas Tyson, of KBW Inc, said in a note on Monday. Approval by the board came with conditions: the government must reduce pension spending by 10 percent beginning in 2020, cut Christmas bonuses and implement employee furloughs as soon as July 1 to stave off a shortterm cash crunch. AUSTERITY PUSH DRAWS PROTESTSThe austerity push drew protests outside the meeting in lower Manhattan on Monday, including from teachers who claimed the furloughs would shorten the public school year by the equivalent of two months a year. Related CoveragePuerto Rico governor says he wants to improve, not 'destroy,' PREPA restructuringThe government can avoid the furloughs and bonus cuts if it presents the board with a plan by April 30 to shore up liquidity by $200 million. Rossello said he was confident the cuts would not be necessary. “I’m very confident we’ll have $200 million in reserve cash, so that we can jump over that obstacle,” Rossello said in an interview with  after Monday’s meeting. The board said it will negotiate over the next 30 days with the government on how to cut pensions, a contentious issue on an island where retirement systems are already borderline insolvent thanks to decades of mismanagement by governments that routinely made overly generous promises to workers. “All stakeholders have been forced to sacrifice, and no one is exempt from that,” board member Andrew Biggs, a pension expert, told reporters after the meeting. He added the cuts will be orchestrated “in a way that would spare the lowestincome people from any reductions. ”Rossello said he will not pass public policy that would hurt the poorest pensioners. “I don’t see any way I can reduce pensions of people already having a hard time getting medications and things. ”In another controversial move, the board said it supported government efforts to seek additional concessions from bondholders of Puerto Rico’s power utility, PREPA, which is more than $8 billion in debt. The utility and its creditors have had a tentative restructuring in place for more than a year, but Rossello’s administration has said it would seek new terms, sparking concern and frustration among PREPA’s creditors. A subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources announced it will hold a hearing on March 22 on the status of the PREPA deal, the current version of which sees creditors taking 15percent cuts.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKBN16K1WG,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico turnaround plan seen under microscope of creditors, board",Nick Brown,3/7/17,"Puerto Rico’s oversight board is racing to review Governor Ricardo Rossello’s blueprint for steering the island’s economy out of fiscal crisis, but has key concerns over whether it can be implemented as planned, a source familiar with the process told  on Tuesday. Rossello last week unveiled a draft turnaround plan ,a requirement of the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA ,for the U.S. territory struggling with $70 billion in debt. It outlines plans for $33. 8 billion in fiscal reforms, including $12. 9 billion in new revenues, and forecasts the Puerto Rican government to have $1. 2 billion a year available to service debt ,just 30 percent of what comes due next fiscal year. A turnaround plan must be approved by the oversight board, which is in charge of managing the island’s finances. But the plan likely will not be approved as is, according to the source, who is familiar with ongoing talks between the board and government officials. Rossello’s plan departs from some of the board’s key financial projections. Board members are not convinced the figures are based on sound data, said the source, who declined to be named because the talks are not public. “The board just doesn’t see a degree of specificity in the document that can give basis or justification for these numbers,” the person said. Specifically, the board is concerned about the basis for the island’s claim that it can generate $3. 6 billion over ten years from improvements in tax collection. It also is skeptical as to whether Rossello can successfully implement key costsaving measures like turning the island’s government into a singleemployer structure, the person said. The board wants to approve a turnaround plan for the island by next Wednesday. It met with government officials in Puerto Rico last week and convened a private board meeting on Monday in New York. It also plans to hold a public meeting in New York on Monday. The island needs to do more to shore up shortterm liquidity, the source added, especially in light of the government’s announcement on Tuesday that its funding gap this fiscal year is $500 million above projections. Elias Sanchez, Rossello’s liaison to the board, defended the plan in an interview with  on Tuesday. The tax reform measures “are not simply based on improvements in collection, but on use of new technology and on reforms that will broaden the collection base,” Sanchez said. He added Puerto Rico’s dire straits will ensure the political will to make the singleemployer plan a reality. “We either make these structural changes or we collapse,” Sanchez said. “It’s not a matter of political will. ”CREDITORS GRUMBLEThe island’s creditors, meanwhile, say the current version of the plan does not do enough to ensure debt payments will be made. One creditor said the governor “changed his tune” from campaign promises last year to minimize cuts to debt repayments. “He campaigned on paying debt, and this plan shows there’s going to be severe impairment,” the creditor said in an interview on Monday, requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks. Rossello’s $1. 2 billion figure is below debt service projections proposed last year by exGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla ,a populist and Wall Street critic, whose policies Rossello railed against during last year’s election. To be sure, government officials have said they believe it likely the U.S. Congress will increase the island’s federal healthcare reimbursements, which could boost its debt service capacity as high as $2. 7 billion. The plan calls for a $64 million annual cut in pension benefits. That’s a lot less than the $200 million the board recommended, but still does not sit well with pension advocates. “These retirement benefits were promised in exchange for labor and services rendered and constitute deferred compensation owed to these citizens,” said Robert Gordon, a lawyer for a committee of local pensioners. While creditors are quick to protest, some believe Rossello’s plan has more to like than dislike from a bondholder’s perspective. As Height Securities analyst Ed Groshans said in a note on Tuesday, the oversight board’s own projections had forecast Puerto Rico to have only $800 million a year to pay debt.

UPDATE 2-Puerto Rico oversight board taps ex-Cleary lawyer as general counsel,Nick Brown,2/23/17,"The federally appointed board tasked with managing Puerto Rico’s finances hired retired attorney Jaime A. El Koury, formerly of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, as its general counsel, it said on Thursday. El Koury, a graduate of Yale Law School, will lead the board in helping the U.S. territory restructure some $70 billion in debt. Cleary was counsel to the Puerto Rican government during exGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla’s administration, from 2014 to 2016. El Koury retired from Cleary in 2014 and did not work on the Puerto Rico matter while at the firm, board spokesman Jose Cedeno said. New Governor Ricardo Rossello, who criticized Garcia Padilla’s fiscal policies and legislative initiatives during last year’s campaign, fired Cleary when he took office on Jan. 2. El Koury will advise the oversight board, which is separate from the island’s government, although the two will work closely in the coming months as Puerto Rico tries to restructure debt and stave off economic crisis characterized by a 45 percent poverty rate and nearinsolvent public health and pension systems. Under a 2016 federal rescue law known as PROMESA, the board must approve Puerto Rico’s budgeting and financial turnaround strategies, a source of tension among locals and Puerto Rico lawmakers, who see it as encroaching on the island’s selfgovernance. El Koury, born and raised in Puerto Rico, worked on myriad corporate matters at Cleary, including mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and other financial transactions, the oversight board said in a statement. “We are very pleased to be able to count on Jaime’s legal expertise, negotiating abilities, understanding of economics and impeccable ethical and professional credentials,” José Carrión, the board’s chairman, said in the statement. El Koury said he welcomed the chance to help revitalize his island. “PROMESA is a tool provided by Congress to help get the island back on the path of fiscal balance,” he said in the statement. “And I will do my very best to help the Oversight Board achieve those goals. ” (Reporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Andrew Hay and Dan Grebler)Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-oversightboard-idUSL1N1G81T5,Reuters,Neutral
Pension crisis forces Puerto Rico retirees to rethink future,DANICA COTO,2/9/17,"Juan Camacho thought he would visit Spain, take a university literature course and get to sleep in more when he retired after nearly four decades as a teacher. Instead, the 70-year-old is working as a second-grade teacher’s assistant to supplement his pension as the U.S. territory’s government warns its public retirement system could dry up by next year amid an economic crisis. “A person dedicates their entire life to public service ... and then at the end of the road, there’s no guarantee that we’re going to live the last years of our life with dignity,” Camacho said. Puerto Rico’s economic crisis has left the public retirement system with a more than $40 billion deficit and that’s pushing elderly people who depend on it back into the workforce. The situation threatens to plunge the island’s rapidly aging population into poverty as it already struggles with high taxes, expensive medical bills and increased utility rates. The government is Puerto Rico’s largest employer, and its three main retirement systems pay pensions to more than 150,000 former government workers. The systems’ combined liability grew by $10 billion from 2009 to 2013, prompting the former governor to increase retirement ages, reduce benefits and increase employer and employee contributions. But because of economic problems, the government has not paid most additional contributions, angering retirees who already believe their money was mismanaged when it was invested in risky bonds. Independent audits have shown the pension system was long mishandled and that past governments increased worker benefits without adding money to the system. Things got worse as the number of pensioners grew, their salaries rose and they lived longer. “Now there are people who are 80 years old and are still working because they cannot afford to stay at home,” said Roberto Aquino Garcia, president of the Association of Retired Puerto Rico Government Workers. “This crisis has been a disaster from an emotional viewpoint.” Puerto Rico’s average public pension is roughly $1,100 a month, but more than 38,000 retired government employees get only $500 because of the type of job they had and the number of years worked, he said. Many now struggle to find work given their age and the few jobs available on an island of 3.4 million people with 12 percent unemployment, higher than any U.S. state. Eighteen percent of Puerto Rico’s population is 65 years or older, and nearly 450,000 of them are retired workers who receive Social Security. Edwin Rosario, a 68-year-old security guard, said he doesn’t plan to retire because his mother is among those receiving $500 monthly. She is in her 90s, has Alzheimer’s and is cared for in part by his sister, who gets the same amount. “We have to prepare ourselves because we don’t know what’s coming,” Rosario said, his eyes filling with tears. “Even if they touch $1 of her pension, that’s too much. What she receives is close to nothing.” Teachers and police officers are especially at risk because they don’t collect Social Security, depending solely on their pensions. Newly elect Gov. Ricardo Rossello has promised to protect government retirees and recently approved a law seeking to boost the public pension system with private investment. But many retirees worry it won’t happen soon enough. Meanwhile, a federal control board Congress created last year to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances demands new austerity efforts. It has suggested a 10 percent cut in pensions to generate some $200 million in savings, but that would also slash individual payments to below $1,000 a month, said Natalia Palmer Cancel, director of Puerto Rico’s Administration of Retirement Systems. “That is definitely worrisome,” she said. “Clearly, retirees would be living below the poverty level.” The board also has urged salary freezes and elimination of jobs through attrition. Officials say such moves would only increase the number of government retirees and shrink the payroll, diminishing contributions to an already wobbly system. The situation worries retirees such as former police captain Rolando Padilla, who joined the force at age 19 and retired in 2013 at 54. He has considered getting another job, noting that some former co-workers are security guards and a close friend drives a school bus. “You barely survive with the pension,” he said, adding he doesn’t like the idea of needing a job. “You retire to rest and enjoy your family. You don’t retire with the idea that you’re going to keep working.” The pensioners say they worry about their health as they struggle to return to work. Some formed a nonprofit organization and hired a law firm that represented retirees in Detroit in hopes of pressuring the control board to reconsider pension cuts. “We’re going to have a humanitarian crisis,” said Jose Marin, spokesman for the Pro-Retiree Movement. “Retirees nowadays are being forced to pick between buying food and buying medicine.” Camacho said he’s grateful he hasn’t reached that point, but he now goes to the movies less and wears jeans and T-shirts more to reduce dry cleaning bills. He’s also given up on taking the university literature courses he looked forward to when he retired 10 years ago. “There are no loans for that kind of dream,” he said. “Things are going to get worse than they are right now. People in Puerto Rico are going to suffer.” ___ Danica Coto on Twitter: www.twitter.com/danicacoto",https://apnews.com/953b77e8ffc84f3789097dcad7088b32,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico gov approves referendum in quest for statehood,DANICA COTO,2/3/17,"Puerto Ricans are getting another shot at voting on statehood after the island’s governor on Friday approved a non-binding referendum to determine the U.S. territory’s political future. The referendum will be held on June 11 and gives voters two options: statehood or independence/free association. If a majority chooses the latter, a second referendum would be held in October and will ask voters to choose between the two. “Colonialism is not an option for Puerto Rico,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. “It’s a civil rights issue ... The time will come in which the United States has to respond to the demands of 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy.” Backers say the referendum could help the island overcome a decade-long economic crisis as it struggles to restructure nearly $70 billion in public debt and faces a federal control board pushing for more austerity measures. If U.S. Congress ultimately were to approve Puerto Rico as the 51st state, the island could receive an additional $10 billion in federal funds a year and its government agencies and municipalities would be able to file for bankruptcy, something that both local and federal laws currently prohibit. Statehood supporters say it additionally would grant the U.S. territory more equality: Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who are not allowed to vote in presidential elections and their representative in Congress has limited voting powers. The island also pays Social Security and Medicare taxes, but receives less benefits than U.S. states. Roughly half a million people have left Puerto Rico for the U.S. mainland in the past decade, leaving the government with a shrinking tax base as it struggles to find new sources of revenue despite increasing taxes and utility bills. Puerto Ricans have voted in four previous referendums that have resulted in no action from U.S. Congress, which has final say on any changes in Puerto Rico’s political status. There was no clear majority in the first three referendums. In the last one, held in 2012, 54 percent said they wanted a change in status. Sixty-one percent who answered a second question said they favored statehood, but nearly 500,000 left that question blank, leading many to dismiss the result as illegitimate. Concerns are now growing about the way the fifth referendum is worded. “It doesn’t leave room for any other options, which I think is a strong portion of the electorate,” said Edwin Melendez, director for the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York’s Hunter College. “It’s not evident that statehood is the clear majority right now...If something like 2012 is repeated, it’s not going to have any legitimacy to move forward.” Along with the referendum, Puerto Rico legislators expect to vote on a bill that would allow Rossello to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose two senators and five representatives to Congress and send them to Washington to demand statehood, a strategy Tennessee used to join the union in the 18th century. U.S. President Donald Trump did not say during his campaign whether he supports statehood, only that the will of Puerto Ricans “should be considered” by Congress. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how people vote in Puerto Rico,” Melendez said. “Congress needs to approve of it.” ___ Danica Coto on Twitter: www.twitter.com/danicacoto",https://apnews.com/eeec5f33ca0740198cceb511d8e64ce5/puerto-rico-gov-approves-referendum-quest-statehood,AP,Neutral
Rothschild replaces Millstein as Puerto Rico financial adviser,Nick Brown,1/18/17,"Puerto Rico’s new government has hired Rothschild & Co to help it develop a fiscal turnaround plan and lead restructuring negotiations with creditors holding some $70 billion in debt, the government announced on Wednesday. Rothschild will replace Millstein and Co, which had served as financial adviser under the administration of exGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla. Governor Ricky Rossello, who was sworn in on Jan. 2, had sharply criticized Garcia Padilla’s financial policies, which were shaped in large part by Millstein, during his campaign. Rothschild’s hiring comes a few days after Rossello’s administration tapped law firm Dentons to serve as legal counsel, replacing Cleary Gottlieb, which had played that role for Garcia Padilla. In a statement on Wednesday, Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, the U.S. territory’s primary fiscal agent, said the Rothschild team would be led by Todd Snyder, the firm’s restructuring chief. “We selected Rothschild & Co based upon its commitment to Puerto Rico and its extensive track record advising in many of the most complex transactions in recent years,” Gerardo Portela, FAFAA’s executive director, said in the statement. Puerto Rico faces months of complicated debt restructuring talks with myriad creditor groups. The U.S. territory owes $18 billion in general obligation debt, backed by a constitutional promise; $15 billion in socalled COFINA debt backed by sales tax proceeds; and billions more in debt at public agencies like power authority PREPA and water utility PRASA. Nearly half the island’s 3. 5 million residents live in poverty. Its unemployment rate is more than twice the U.S. average, and its population continues to fall as locals flock to the U.S. mainland. Under a federal rescue law known as PROMESA, passed last year, the island must submit a fiscal turnaround plan to a federal board appointed to manage the island’s finances. The board will also likely play a role in facilitating debt restructuring talks between the island and creditors. Garcia Padilla had pushed for sharp reductions in debt payments to creditors, and ordered several defaults during his term. Rossello, who favors U.S. statehood for the island, believes it should try to limit such cuts while imposing belttightening measures like consolidating public agencies.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-advisers-idUSKBN1522J0,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico needs urgent Congress action: U.S. Treasury, Health chiefs",Nick Brown,1/17/17,"The secretaries of the U.S. Treasury and Health and Human Services called for fast congressional action to help Puerto Rico out of its economic mess, and said a bipartisan task force report failed to go far enough on recommending a lowincome tax credit for the commonwealth. Slideshow ( 2 images )In a letter to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell reaffirmed calls to step up healthcare funding for Puerto Rico. “We write to underscore the need for additional legislation early in this (congressional) session to address the economic and fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico,” the letter said. They noted that 900,000 Puerto Ricans could risk losing healthcare unless Congress took action by April. The U.S. territory is hampered by $70 billion in debt, unemployment more than twice the U.S. average, a 45 percent poverty rate and a decreasing population as locals flock to the U.S. mainland. A congressional task force of U.S. senators and congressmen in December recommended several fixes for Puerto Rico, including boosting healthcare funding and exploring giving the island access to the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. The benefit for low,to moderateincome workers has been used to combat poverty, and the Obama Administration has proposed expanding it to Puerto Rico. If the credit exceeds a worker’s income tax liability, the government will refund the balance. The report did not go far enough with the tax credit, Lew and Burwell said, calling the benefit a “powerful economic driver. ”The task force report described healthcare in Puerto Rico as “a serious and urgent issue,” but did not agree on solutions. For decades, the United States offered lower payments to most island residents under the federally sponsored Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs. Funding for the Medicaid program for the poor, for example, has been capped by Washington, spurring island officials to borrow heavily through municipal bonds.

"Puerto Rico governor seeks more time on fiscal plan, lawsuit freeze",Nick Brown,1/5/17,"Puerto Rico’s new governor is seeking more time to present a fiscal turnaround plan for the struggling U.S. territory, saying the Jan. 31 deadline set by the commonwealth’s federal oversight board is too tight. In a letter to the board dated Jan. 4, a representative for Governor Ricardo Rossello, who was sworn in on Monday, sought at least a 45day extension, which would push the deadline to present a plan to March 17. Under the territory’s federal rescue law known as PROMESA, passed last year, Puerto Rico’s governor has to present a blueprint for the island’s financial future that must be approved by the federallyappointed board tasked with managing its dire fiscal position. The board last year set a Jan. 31 deadline for the plan, but Elias Sanchez, Rossello’s liaison to the board, said the deadline would give the administration too little time to assess Puerto Rico’s finances or attempt restructuring talks. The governor also sought a 75day extension of PROMESA’s socalled automatic stay provision, which prevents creditors from suing Puerto Rico over missed debt payments. With the stay set to expire on Feb. 15, Rossello asked the board to extend it until May 1. That would give the island more time to try to negotiate restructuring talks with holders of $70 billion in debt issued by Puerto Rico and its public agencies. If the deadline expired in February, it could force Puerto Rico or the board to preemptively push some public agencies into a legal process under PROMESA akin to U.S. bankruptcy protection, known as Title III, the letter said. “We are very concerned that a rushed process to certify a fiscal plan by January 31, 2017, and a view that the movement of the PROMESA stay on February 15, 2017, is an intractable deadline, could prematurely precipitate Title III filings for some or all” of the government’s public debt issuers, the letter stated. Puerto Rico owes $18 billion in general obligation debt, backed only by a constitutional promise; $15 billion in socalled COFINA debt backed by sales tax proceeds, and billions more in debt at myriad public entities, such as the PREPA power authority and PRASA water utility.

4 guilty in 1 of Puerto Rico’s biggest corruption cases,DANICA COTO,10/7/16,"A federal jury on Friday found four people guilty on all charges in one of Puerto Rico’s biggest public corruption cases in the past decade. They were the last of the 10 people to be charged and convicted in the fraud scheme that generated some $2 million. Ivonne Falcon, a former vice president and treasurer of Puerto Rico’s heavily indebted water and sewer company, and Sally Lopez, a former director of the island’s Administration of Workforce Development, were found guilty of charges including bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and federal programs fraud. They could get up to 80-100 years in prison. Falcon’s sister, Marielis Falcon, and Glenn Omar Rivera, who worked in the administrative office of the island’s House of Representatives, were also found guilty. Their attorneys said they will appeal. Douglas Leff, special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Juan division, said in a phone interview that he was pleased with the verdicts. “It’s the most significant public corruption conviction we’ve had in at least a decade,” he said, adding that federal agents in Puerto Rico are pursuing other similar cases. “There’ll be more coming in the near future.” Friday’s verdicts come amid a punishing economic crisis and revelations of government excesses and corruption that have angered Puerto Ricans. At the center of the scheme was businessman Anaudi Hernandez, a one-time campaign fundraiser for the governor’s Popular Democratic Party. He was accused of offering public officials items such as expensive meals, fountain pens and concert tickets in exchange for political favors and government contracts. He has since pleaded guilty after also being accused of using his connections with high-ranking government officials, including the brother of Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, to appoint people to certain positions. The case has dealt several blows to the U.S. territory’s ruling party. The speaker of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives recently stepped down, and one senator said she would not seek re-election during next month’s general elections. The four people found guilty on Friday will remain free on bond until sentencing, scheduled for early February.",https://apnews.com/ae02babe736f4ffcbe1b48fd5faad228/4-guilty-in-1-of-Puerto-Rico's-biggest-corruption-cases,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico finds unexpected source of growth in agriculture,DANICA COTO,9/28/16,"Puerto Ricans are buying rice produced on the island for the first time in nearly 30 years. They are also eating locally grown mushrooms, kale and even arugula, along with more traditional crops such as plantains and pineapples. The U.S. territory is seeing something of an agricultural renaissance as new farms spring up across the island, supplying an increasing number of farmers’ markets and restaurants to meet consumer demand for fresher produce. Farming has become one of the few areas of growth on an island struggling to emerge from a 10-year-old recession and a still-unfolding debt crisis. The most recent statistics from the governor’s office show farm income grew 25 percent to more than $900 million in 2012-2014. The amount of acreage under cultivation rose 50 percent over the past four years, generating at least 7,000 jobs. “More and more people have noticed that this is one of the only successful ways of living on the island right now,” said Tara Rodriguez Besosa, a farming advocate and owner of an organic restaurant in San Juan that buys from local farms, including one started by her mother several years ago. Agriculture is a small part of the economy in Puerto Rico, well behind manufacturing, finance and tourism. But the growth is notable simply because things are so bad overall. Many businesses have closed, tens of thousands of people have decamped to the U.S. mainland, unemployment is at nearly 12 percent and the government is in default. Congress gave the territory some breathing room in June with legislation to enable the restructuring of what the governor has called its “unpayable” $70 billion debt, but the effects of that legislation have yet to be felt widely. The agricultural rebirth can be seen in the aisles of supermarkets, where local rice went on sale in August for the first time since the last producer closed in 1989, and in the shimmering green fields where the grain is grown on the outskirts of the southwestern town of Guanica. The government helped launch Finca Fraternidad, or “Fraternity Farm,” by providing 1,350 acres of vacant public land. The rice venture is one of about 350 farms that the government supported to reduce Puerto Rico’s reliance on expensive food imports and spur the growth of a sector that dominated the economy until the 1940s, when the territory began a decades-long transformation into a more urban, developed society where few wanted to work on farms. “It’s satisfying to change the perspective of an island that once viewed agriculture as a thing of the past, as something for people without education,” Puerto Rican Agriculture Secretary Myrna Comas said. It can still be a challenge to find workers, especially for labor-intensive crops like coffee. But 25-year-old Jonathan Rodriguez, who has been working on the harvest at Finca Fraternidad, said the job appeals to him. “I like it because it’s something that we sow for the island,” he said on a scorching recent morning. “And that’s why we’re here, to make Puerto Rico better.” In the west and the south, the government has launched a project to supply the local rum industry with homegrown sugarcane, which dominated the economy in the 19th century but all but disappeared as it became cheaper to produce elsewhere. About 870 acres of cane have been planted so far, and Comas said the plan is to expand to 11,600 acres. In addition to the many small, independent farms, the island has seen investment in large-scale agriculture. Bayer, the German medicine and farm-chemical maker, announced this month that it would spend $17 million to develop two agriculture biotech facilities in the U.S. territory. Monsanto, the Missouri-based seed and weed-killer company, has large fields of corn, soy and cotton in Puerto Rico and recently invested $5 million in its projects. Even pot growers are looking to set up shop. Following a 2015 executive order legalizing medical marijuana derivatives, GreenVision LLC, a subsidiary of Nevada-based StereoVision Entertainment Inc., announced plans in August to build a 40,000-square-foot (3,700-square-meter) cultivation and manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. But it’s the small-scale farming that is most visible to consumers. The number of farmers’ markets has tripled in the past four years to more than a dozen across the island, said Mayra Nieves, president of a local nonprofit organic food cooperative. That has quadrupled overall business to some $35 million a year, spurred in large part by interest in organic produce, Comas said. There are also urban community gardens popping up across the capital that cater to people who want something fresher than the shrink-wrapped imports that have long been standard at stores and restaurants. “People are becoming more open-minded,” Nieves said. “They no longer see us as ‘those hippies.’” ___ Danica Coto on Twitter: www.twitter.com/danicacoto",https://apnews.com/21a001ef81984f48801382d416c8f660/puerto-rico-finds-unexpected-source-growth-agriculture,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico debt fix unlikely to resemble Detroit's,Nick Brown,9/5/16,"The federal appointees tapped to help map Puerto Rico’s economic future are technocrats more than political actors, and that could make the U.S. territory’s fiscal turnaround look more like a corporate restructuring than a politically charged municipal bankruptcy in the vein of Detroit. Tourists stand inside a souvenir shop in San Juan, Puerto Rico, August 3, 2015.    REUTERS/Alvin Baez/File PhotoThe law known as PROMESA, which created the board when it passed the U.S. Congress in June with bipartisan support, envisioned a pragmatic solution for an island combating $70 billion in debt, 45 percent poverty and a brain drain as residents bolt in droves for the mainland United States. Its members, four Republicans and three Democrats appointed last week, were chosen by Republican and Democratic lawmakers and President Barack Obama. The board has broad powers to help stabilize the island’s economy, from investigating Puerto Rico’s government to working with that government on projects to spur economic growth. It must also approve the island’s annual budgets, and will eventually facilitate debtrestructuring talks with creditors. In the latter endeavor, it will have to navigate a minefield of competing interests. The island has 18 separate debt issuers, backed by different revenues streams, as well as $18 billion in socalled general obligation debt backed by the “full faith and credit” of the territory’s government. While that promise is legally weak in a bankruptcy setting, it is a sacrosanct pledge in municipal debt markets. Holders of all that debt will jockey for payouts against government vendors and beneficiaries of the island’s public pensions, which have less than $2 billion in assets to cover some $45 billion in liabilities. Detroit’s bankruptcy, which ended in December 2014, treated city pensions much better than its outstanding bonds, which were largely insured. Some Puerto Rico creditors, still suffering Detroit flashbacks, feared Puerto Rico could look similar ,especially since Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed big haircuts and railed against the idea of reducing government services. But the makeup of the Puerto Rico board has offered some reassurance, said Nader Tavakoli, chief executive officer of Ambac, which insures $2. 2 billion of Puerto Rican bonds and also insured some of Detroit’s bonds. “These board members are technocrats, and it gives us confidence that this is not going to be overly politicized,” he said. Deal makers also feature prominently, with an exbankruptcy judge, a banker and a hedge fund operator in the mix. Slideshow ( 2 images )Republicans, generally seen as creditorfriendly, nominated a bankruptcy academic who favors restructuring the island’s debt, David Skeel. And Democrats nominated a banker, Jose Ramon Gonzalez, and a Democratic finance expert in Ana Matosantos who directed California’s budget under former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Experts see the group as likely to push a solution that sees all sides share a burden, a typical approach for companies restructuring under Chapter 11. “There are no ideologues in the group,” said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson. That does not mean there are not drawbacks. For one, the board will have to navigate a testy local political climate with residents who largely revile a panel they see as an extension of colonial rule. Island voters broadly unhappy with the Garcia Padilla administration in November will elect a new governor as well as members of the legislature and scores of mayors. “There are still politics here,” said veteran bankruptcy attorney Richard Levin, who is following the situation. “The governor and legislature retain some authority. ”For Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, the board is short on expertise in economic development. Any real solution for Puerto Rico requires fundamental economic changes, including at its underperforming education department, and it’s unclear whether the board can facilitate such change. But from a financial perspective, at least, the board seems less inclined to promote a political agenda than figure out a collaborative fix and then get out, said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics. “The board is not being installed to fight with Puerto Ricans or to impose some kind of federal view,” Fabian said. “They just want these troubles to be fixed. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-controlboard-analysis-idUSKCN11B2F5,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico oversight board appointed,Susan Cornwell,8/31/16,"President Barack Obama on Wednesday appointed a sevenmember board to oversee a financial restructuring for Puerto Rico, a majority Republican panel that some market analysts saw as favorable for bondholders of the U.S. territory, which has been crippled by a $70 billion debt crisis. Slideshow ( 5 images )Among the board members, who Obama appointed on the recommendation of legislative leaders, are Arthur Gonzalez, a Democrat and a retired bankruptcy judge who oversaw the Chapter 11 cases of Chrysler and Enron, and Carlos Garcia, a Republican and the former head of Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank who now runs private equity firm BayBoston. The other appointees are Republicans Andrew Biggs, David Skeel and Jose Carrion III, and Democrats Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Ana Matosantos. The idea of a fiscal control board, known colloquially as La Junta in Puerto Rico, is largely reviled on the island, which has a 45 percent poverty rate and whose chronic economic slump has helped spur rampant outmigration. Among the messages by protesters and graffiti artists plastered around San Juan are: “Wake up! They’re selling our homeland!” and “Say no to oppression. ”But from a market perspective the board figures to be a positive for creditors of the island, said David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital. He particularly cited Garcia, calling him “an investor guy, very intertwined with everything that has happened up until now. ”And the Democrats on the panel are more moderate than expected, Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson said in note. Jose Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, may be the “key swing vote” for creditorfriendly policies, Hanson said. Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson, in a note last week, listed Jose Gonzalez, a former Santander executive, as a potential creditor ally because of his “significant experience in Puerto Rico’s banking sector. ”The board was created under the federal law known as PROMESA, passed earlier this year, which will bring Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight and give it the authority to restructure some of its debt. The board will be tasked with assessing and certifying annual budgets and a fiscal recovery plan presented by the island’s government, as well as facilitating debt restructuring talks on the island, possibly through a bankruptcylike process. One interesting pick is Skeel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Though Republicans are generally seen as creditorfriendly, Skeel, a restructuring industry veteran, has repeatedly called for a broadbased restructuring in Puerto Rico. But he has also stressed that creditor rights should be protected in such a scenario, possibly a good sign for the fate of Puerto Rico’s general obligation debt. That debt is viewed as sacrosanct in municipal debt markets, but it has no legal security under bankruptcy law, which has given some GO holders reason to fret. Importantly, much of the negotiation tactics may be driven by the team of lawyers and financial advisers the board will ultimately select to represent it. Restructuring consultant Martha Kopacz, of Phoenix Management Services, and veteran bankruptcy lawyer Richard Levin, of Jenner & Block, are among the professionals said to be lobbying to represent the board, according to people familiar with the situation. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, each chose two members of the board, while House and Senate Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Democrats, made one pick apiece. Obama chose the seventh member.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-board-idUSKCN11628X,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. declares a Zika public health emergency in Puerto Rico,Julie Steenhuysen,8/12/16,"The Obama administration on Friday declared a public health emergency in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, saying the rapid and widespread transmission of the Zika virus threatens the health of infected pregnant women and their babies. A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan, in this January 27, 2016, file photo. EUTERS/Alvin Baez/FilesThe Caribbean island of about 3. 5 million people has recorded 10,690 laboratoryconfirmed cases of Zika, including 1,035 pregnant women, but the actual number of infections with the mosquitoborne virus is likely higher, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. Among U.S. states and territories, Puerto Rico is expected to see the worst of the Zika outbreak due to its tropical climate and a lack of infrastructure for mosquito control. The only local transmission of the virus so far reported in the continental United States has been in South Florida. The virus can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by abnormally small head size and developmental problems in babies. It also can also be spread by sex, prompting public health officials to advise that people who have been infected refrain from unprotected sex for several months. “This administration is committed to meeting the Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico with the necessary urgency,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. The public health emergency declaration is a tool for the federal government to provide fresh support to Puerto Rico’s government to tackle the outbreak and grants access to certain federal funds. The last time HHS declared such an emergency was in 2012 in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, which slammed into the New Jersey shore and flooded parts of New York City. It was the second important step to fight Zika that the federal government has taken in as many days. The administration said on Thursday it had shifted $81 million in funds from other projects to continue work on developing vaccines to fight Zika in the absence of any funding from U.S. lawmakers. REQUEST FROM THE GOVERNORHHS made the declaration at the request of Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro García Padilla. It allows Puerto Rico to apply for funding to hire and train unemployed workers to assist in mosquito control efforts, as well as for outreach and education efforts. It also allows Puerto Rico to temporarily reassign public health workers to assist in the Zika response. “The declaration will allow access to more funds, the waiving of certain regulatory procedures to speed response, reassign key personnel, allow temporary personnel appointments, and provide the authority to take necessary actions to combat the outbreak,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security in Baltimore. Also on Friday, Florida said three more people had become infected with Zika by local mosquitoes, bringing the total to 28. Zika was first detected last year in Brazil, where it has taken its heaviest toll so far, and has spread rapidly through Latin America and the Caribbean. “The threat of Zika to future generations of Puerto Ricans is evident, and I feel a responsibility to do everything that is within my reach to make sure we fight the spread of the virus,” Garcia Padilla said in a statement. The Obama administration in February requested $1. 9 billion to fight Zika, but the Republicanled Congress has approved no money. A bill providing $1. 1 billion was blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortionprovider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare services, mainly in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-usa-idUSKCN10N2KA,Reuters,Neutral

Puerto Rico rejects insecticide to fight Zika amid protests,DANICA COTO,7/22/16,"Puerto Rico’s governor announced Friday that he will not authorize aerial spraying with the insecticide naled to fight an increase in Zika cases as U.S. health officials have urged. Instead, Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla said he will support the spraying of Bti, an organic larvicide. He said it should be sufficient to fight the mosquito-borne virus along with other ongoing efforts, but hoped no child would be “born with congenital defects because of the decision I took.” Zika can cause microcephaly, a rare defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and brain damage. Puerto Ricans in recent weeks have organized several protests against the use of naled, raising concerns about its potential effects on people and wildlife. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently said Puerto Rico lacked an integrated mosquito control program as it fights what it called a silent epidemic. Eight of 10 people show no symptoms of Zika, which can cause symptoms including fever, rash and headache. So far, Puerto Rico has 5,582 Zika cases and is seeing a 20-30 percent weekly increase in those cases, said Health Secretary Ana Rius. There are 662 pregnant women infected with Zika, and up to 80 of them have given birth, all to healthy babies, she said. However, Puerto Rico in May reported the first microcephaly case acquired on U.S. soil. It involved a fetus that a woman turned over to U.S. health officials who found it tested positive for Zika. One death has been reported and 65 people have been hospitalized in connection with the virus. There are also 21 cases of a temporary paralysis condition known as Guillain-Barre that has been linked to Zika. “This illness is not a joke,” said Rius, who originally recommended spraying with naled but later withdrew her support. Garcia’s administration has fought the virus in part by fumigating public housing units where pregnant women live, distributing about 1 million condoms and picking up more than 1.65 million old tires to cut down on breeding sites. Garcia’s announcement on Friday follows a rift between his administration and the CDC, which angered local government officials by sending a shipment of naled to the U.S. territory this week without notifying them. Garcia said he ordered the shipment returned. “This is our island,” he said in a nod to angry Puerto Ricans who accused the federal government of threatening the island’s political autonomy. The CDC addressed that issue in a Friday statement. “We regret that the shipment of naled arrived in Puerto Rico without appropriate levels of awareness,” the agency said. “We moved too quickly in our urgency to do all that we could to be responsive and prepared in the event officials in Puerto Rico decided to use naled.” The CDC said it respected the governor’s decision to not use naled. A spokeswoman said the agency would discuss with Puerto Rico officials the best way to protect pregnant women from Zika, but officials did not specifically say whether they believed the larvicide Bti would be sufficient to fight the virus. The agency has estimated that more than 20 percent of Puerto Rico’s 3.5 million people could be infected with Zika in an outbreak expected to peak by this summer. Local health officials have dismissed that number as exaggerated. ___ Danica Coto on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/danicacoto",https://apnews.com/3e93dacd616f4b1087eed9d5103e4f8f/puerto-rico-rejects-insecticide-fight-zika-amid-protests,AP,Neutral
Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges not over: governor,Richard Cowan,7/12/16,"Puerto Rico, the U.S. commonwealth that recently declared a historic default, could be shut out of debt markets for two more years as it battles with fiscal challenges, the island’s governor said on Tuesday. Puerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla addresses the audience at the capitol building in San Juan, February 29, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin Baez Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said emergency fiscal measures in response to a $70 billion debt were not sustainable and that “Puerto Rico will not endure any more austerity. ”He said a new law enacted by Washington allowing the federal government to appoint a control board would undercut selfgovernment, but added it would help the island confront its fiscal problems. “Our challenges are not over and prosperity will not return overnight,” the governor said during a discussion at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. “It will take maybe two years until the market opens back to Puerto Rico if we do the right thing,” Garcia Padilla said, adding the government had been producing fiscally sound budgets that would help win back creditors. The island has been shut out of debt markets for about a year. Citing falling debt levels, he said it was a “moment of opportunity” in Puerto Rico, which has struggled with high debt loads and a weak economy for years. Puerto Rico defaulted on $779 million of constitutionally backed debt on July 1, among its most senior bonds, opting to pay for essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors. Garcia Padilla said the Puerto Rican government would take steps on its own to get its fiscal affairs in order, therefore minimizing meddling by the oversight board. For example, he said that if the island’s government passed responsible budgets on its own, the control board would not need to impose its own fiscal plans. Garcia Padilla said, however, that while the government must become more efficient to improve its fiscal situation, that should be done through attrition rather than laying off workers. Asked by a reporter about steps that could be taken to shore up the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, or PRASA, Garcia Padilla said: “PREPA is pretty advanced. We’ll be able to reduce a lot the debt related to PREPA. We want to do the same with PRASA. I think we’ll be able to do it. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-governor-idUSKCN0ZS2MV,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico says will default on $779 million of senior debt,Nick Brown,7/1/16,"Puerto Rico on Friday said it will default on $779 million worth of constitutionally backed debt, its most senior bonds, making good on threats that the island would choose paying essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors. Puerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla addresses the audience at the capitol building in San Juan, in this February 29, 2016 file photo. REUTERS/Alvin Baez/FilesDebt payments totaling just over $2 billion were due on Friday. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters on Friday that overall the U.S. commonwealth territory will not pay $911 million worth of its obligations. The U.S. territory’s finances will soon come under a U.S. federal oversight board after U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on Thursday a bill giving the island access to a debt restructuring process, and implementing a halt on litigation arising from any defaults on its $70 billion debt load. “Today, Puerto Rico is protected against creditors’ actions,” Garcia Padilla said. The General Obligation (GO) debt, or debt that carries a GO guarantee, is a category of debt that has not been defaulted upon by any U.S. state in decades. Puerto Rico is not covered by Chapter 9 U.S. bankruptcy code which applies to municipalities. Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank (GDB) said on Friday the island would have just $95 million in cash at the end of the year even after the defaults announced on Friday. Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 GO bond rose 0. 25 points in price to trade at 67. 50 points, pushing the yield down to 12. 519 percent. On Thursday Garcia Padilla authorized Puerto Rico, under a locally written debt moratorium law, to suspend some of the $2 billion in debt payments due on Friday. The developments on Friday represent the nadir of a decadelong effort by Puerto Rico to avoid economic collapse. The island is hamstrung by emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate. “Even if the Commonwealth were to devote every last penny in the (accounts) to debt service on July 1, it would still owe holders of the public debt hundreds of millions of dollars,” the GDB said in a statement on Friday. Some of the debt expected to be defaulted upon such as PBA (Public Building Authority) exseries L bonds will be mostly covered by reserve funds held by the trustee bank. Nearly all of the payments due on the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA) Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs) will be covered by reserve funds as well. If some of the debt is covered by insurance policies, some creditors could receive a portion of their payments. The GDB, Puerto Rico’s primary fiscal agent, said the island has only $200 million in its operating account, and another $150 million in revenue that was redirected in recent months away from other debt payments. Even if the island continues emergency measures like suspending vendor payments and withholding contributions to a pension fund that is already insolvent, the operating account will still run out of cash in 30 to 60 days, the GDB said. “We knew this day would come, that they would default, and it is here. It was a good thing they passed PROMESA, even at the eleventh hour,” Ted Hampton, senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service, said, referring to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA). Late on Thursday the island’s legislature approved an $8. 9 billion fiscal 2017 budget, which now awaits Garcia Padilla’s signature. In the wee hours of Friday, Puerto Rico released longawaited audited financial statements for fiscal year 2014, more than a year late. The statements, audited by KPMG, showed, among other things, that Puerto Rico’s largest public pension has exhausted its assets and is now insolvent. Puerto Rico’s pensions have among the largest funding gaps in U.S. history. “When I entered office, Puerto Rico was property of Wall Street,” Garcia Padilla said, adding: “Today, everybody concludes that we have been telling the truth about Puerto Rico’s fiscal condition. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN0ZH5NI,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico authorizes debt payment suspension; Obama signs rescue bill,Nick Brown,6/30/16,"Puerto Rico authorized suspension of payments on its general obligation debt on Thursday just minutes after U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law creating a federal oversight board with authority to negotiate the restructuring of the island’s $70 billion in debt.

REUTERS/Carlos BarriaThe executive order issued by Puerto Rico’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, comes just one day before the U.S. territory was due to make $1. 9 billion worth of debt payments on July 1, including some $780 million in constitutionallybacked, general obligation bonds. It remains to be seen whether Puerto Rico will pay part of the GO debt or any of the nonGO debt. “Under these circumstances, these executive orders protect the limited resources available to the agencies listed in these orders and prevents that these can be seized by creditors, leaving Puerto Ricans without basic services,” Garcia Padilla’s administration said in a statement. The flurry of activity represents the nadir of a decadelong struggle by Puerto Rico, home to 3. 5 million Americans, to stave off economic collapse, reverse a 45 percent poverty rate and stem rampant emigration that exacerbates the economy’s decline. Garcia Padilla authorized the suspension of general obligation payments under a previously enacted local debt moratorium law that has already been challenged by a creditor lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In addition, Garcia Padilla also declared states of emergency at the island’s biggest public pension ,the Commonwealth’s Employee Retirement System ,which is more than 99 percent underfunded, as well as the University of Puerto Rico and other agencies. Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 0. 44 points in price to trade at 67. 19 points, pushing the yield down to 12. 578 percent. OBAMA SIGNS PROMESAIn Washington, Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, in the Oval office on Thursday, one of the few pieces of bipartisan legislation to make it to his desk. “I want to let the people of Puerto Rico know that although there are still some tough work that we’re going to have to do to dig Puerto Rico out of the hole that it’s in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need,” Obama told reporters before signing it. The law will allow the island access to a bankruptcylike debt restructuring process, but put its finances under the control of a federallyappointed board — a condition that has riled many in Puerto Rico, including Garcia Padilla. PROMESA, which passed the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, puts a stay, or halt, on litigation in the event of a default. Puerto Rico has already defaulted three times on portions of its debt in the last year. The stay is critical to keep Puerto Rico’s financial restructuring from devolving into a mess of long, costly court battles. The stay is retroactive back to December 2015. The oversight board will have the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a courtsupervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy. It will also oversee and monitor the implementation of sustainable budgets. Still, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims should Puerto Rico not deliver the cash to its investors. MBIA’s National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $173 million in GO debt due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers another $184 million, and Ambac insures $40 million in GO or GOguaranteed debt due on Friday. The island’s debtladen semipublic power utility, PREPA, earlier on Thursday announced it will make its full, $415 million payment due Friday, under the terms of a restructuring agreement reached late last year with the bulk of its creditors. PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8. 3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. The payment will be made using operational funds and proceeds from new bond sales. “Today’s outcome is another step towards PREPA’s transformation,” Lisa Donahue, the utility’s chief restructuring officer, said in a statement.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN0ZG09Y,Reuters,Neutral
"Senate passes Puerto Rico debt bill, sends to Obama",Susan Cornwell,6/29/16,"The U.S. Senate gave solid approval on Wednesday to a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, sending the measure to President Obama for his signing into law just ahead of a possible default by the U.S. territory on its next debt payment. A worker takes off U.S and Puerto Rican flag in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 16, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin BaezThe measure passed the Senate on a vote of 6830, and President Obama said in a statement he looked forward to signing the bill into law. The House of Representatives has already approved the bill. “This bill is not perfect, but it is a critical first step toward economic recovery and restored hope for millions of Americans who call Puerto Rico home,” Obama said. The legislation would create a federal oversight board, appointed by Washington, with power to restructure Puerto Rico’s unmanageable debt load. The bill provides for a stay, or halt, to any litigation brought against the Puerto Rican government and its debt issuing agencies that is retroactive to December. This provides breathing room for the board to start the process of restructuring and oversee a sustainable budget process. On Friday, Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1. 9 billion worth of payments. Puerto Rico’s Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said the island will default some of the debt. Supporters said intervention by Washington lawmakers was necessary to help the island’s 3. 5 million U.S. citizens avert a “descent into chaos,” as U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday. Puerto Rico has been waiting for months for Congress to act as its economic crisis worsened. It has already defaulted on some of its debt. The Caribbean island territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, as well as a steady flow of migration to the U.S. mainland that shrinks its tax base and shuttering of essential services. In addition, it is suffering from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. But many Puerto Ricans are leery of the proposed oversight board, fearing it could usurp the island’s government and place investors’ concerns over local priorities. Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 1 full point in price ahead of the final vote, to trade at 66. 75 points, pushing the yield down to 12. 663 percent. Passage of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) came after leaders of both political parties warned that failure to approve the legislation could lead to a U.S. taxpayerfunded bailout. “This is the best and possibly the only action we can take to help Puerto Rico,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said. “Doing nothing now . . . (is) the surest route to both a taxpayer funded bailout of Puerto Rico and a humanitarian crisis for its people,” McConnell said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he shared the concerns of many Democrats with the “excessive powers and appointment structure” of the oversight board, and he was unhappy with some labor provisions. But Reid said he was voting for passage because Puerto Rico needed the help by Friday. “Otherwise we . . . turn them over to the hedge funds and they will sue them to death,” he said. The seven member board, appointed by President Obama from recommendations given by party leaders in both the House and Senate, is supposed to be in place by Sept. 1, 2016. Neither political party was entirely happy with the fix. Democrats bridled at a Republican provision that might lower the minimum wage for some young workers and weaken overtime pay rules while some Republicans were concerned the bill could amount to a bailout of the island, or set a precedent for states in fiscal trouble to seek a similar arrangement. “They’ll say if a territory can receive unprecedented authority from Congress, then why shouldn’t a state?” asked Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. The legislation is geared toward U.S. territories. Puerto Rico is not covered by current U.S. bankruptcy law under Chapter 9. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, opposing the measure, argued that Friday was an arbitrary deadline for action that did not excuse a “flawed” bill. A vote for the bill was “a vote to authorize an unelected, unchecked and all powerful control board to determine Puerto Rico’s destiny for a generation or more,” Menendez declared. Some senators, including Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, criticized the estimated $370 million cost of the legislation over five years, complaining that Puerto Rico will get stuck with the tab while it is struggling to reduce its debt.

U.S. top court tosses Puerto Rico's debt restructuring law,Lawrence Hurley,6/13/16,"The Supreme Court on Monday refused to revive a Puerto Rico debtrestructuring law, putting the U.S. territory at risk of a messy default unless Congress this month passes legislation to help the Caribbean island survive its crippling fiscal crisis. A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S. , May 19, 2016.  REUTERS/Carlos BarriaThe justices ruled 52 that Puerto Rico’s 2014 statute, which would have let it cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities over creditor objections, conflicted with federal bankruptcy law. The justices left in place a 2015 appeals court ruling invalidating the law, called the Recovery Act. Passage of legislation now advancing in the U.S. Congress is likely the only remaining option to restructure Puerto Rico’s debt in a bid to avoid a default in the U.S. territory of about 3. 5 million people that is burdened by a $70 billion debt load it has said it cannot pay. The U.S. House of Representatives last Thursday overwhelmingly passed legislation creating a federal control board to help Puerto Rico cope with its debt, and sent the bill to the Senate for consideration. The White House has urged the Senate to act promptly so President Barack Obama can sign the bill into law ahead of a looming July 1 deadline for Puerto Rico to make a $1. 9 billion debt payment. But the Senate’s Republican leaders have not yet revealed their plans for dealing with the legislation. The proposed oversight board would be tasked with working with investors on restructuring Puerto Rico’s debt and would have the authority to push the island into a bankruptcylike court process in which it could restructure debt without the agreement of creditors. Puerto Rico does not have Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, unlike the 50 U.S. states. Puerto Rico’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, while supporting the bill generally, has expressed reservations about the broad powers it would give the oversight board. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the Supreme Court, said Puerto Rico is not considered a U.S. state in one part of bankruptcy law, meaning it cannot authorize its municipal agencies to restructure debt. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. Puerto Rico, also hit by a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population, faces economic calamity without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors, which include U.S. hedge funds. In 1984, Congress passed legislation that prohibited Puerto Rico, as a U.S. territory and not a state, from using laws that let states put struggling municipalities into bankruptcy. The reinstatement of the Puerto Rico law could have threatened a hardfought, consensual restructuring at power authority PREPA under which creditors holding most of the utility’s $8. 3 billion in debt agreed to take 15 percent reductions in payouts. The Recovery Act might have allowed Puerto Rico to scrap that deal and instead put PREPA into bankruptcy, where it could impose deeper cuts and bind holdout creditors. Two U.S. lower court decisions found the Recovery Act invalid after PREPA creditors sued. The Supreme Court heard arguments in Puerto Rico’s appeal on March 22. “We are grateful for the Supreme Court’s careful consideration of the case, and are pleased that we now can put this litigation behind us,” said Matthew McGill, an attorney for one group of creditors. The price on Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond gyrated in the wake of the court’s decision. 74514LE86=MSRB‘REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES’Puerto Rico’s governor signed an emergency bill on April 6 allowing the government to halt payments on its debt, throwing into doubt broader restructuring plans to stave off a financial collapse. “Preemption cases may seem like abstract discussions of the appropriate balance between states and federal power,” Sotomayor wrote in dissent. “But they have real world consequences. Finding preemption here means that a government is left powerless with no legal process to help its 3. 5 million citizens. ”Sotomayor, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico and moved to New York before she was born, said Puerto Ricans “should not have to wait for possible congressional action to avert the consequences of unreliable electricity, transportation and safe water. ”Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson said the ruling should be read in concert with a separate Supreme Court decision last week holding that Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign entity from the United States for the purposes of bringing criminal charges. The two rulings show that “Puerto Rico’s ultimate source of authority is the U.S. Congress, and the power to overrule what Congress has ordained – including in the Puerto Rico constitution – is nonexistent,” Hanson wrote. That could make it harder for Puerto Rico’s governor to make good on his threat to default on debt backed by Puerto Rico’s constitution in the name of maintaining government services, Hanson added. Only seven justices considered the case because Justice Samuel Alito recused himself and Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, has not yet been replaced.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-puertorico-idUSKCN0YZ1OG,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. top court deals blow to Puerto Rico sovereignty claim,Lawrence Hurley,6/9/16,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Puerto Rico cannot pursue charges against people for the same crime that federal authorities have already prosecuted them, dealing a blow to the U.S. territory’s claim that while it is not a state it should be treated like one. Cars move in the afternoon traffic on the expressway Las Americas in San Juan, December 1, 2015.  REUTERS/Alvin Baez The court ruled 62 in favor of defendants Luis Sanchez Valle and Jaime Gomez Vazquez, who were charged with illegally selling guns in 2008 by Puerto Rican authorities as well as federal prosecutors. The two pleaded guilty to the federal charges and then argued that Puerto Rico’s indictments should be dismissed because of the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution that bars people from being prosecuted twice for the same offense. A trial judge dismissed the Puerto Rico charges, but they were reinstated by an appeals court. In a March 2015 ruling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled against prosecutors, prompting the territory to appeal to the high court. On its surface, the case was about criminal law. But it also raised questions about the extent to which the Caribbean island, which has been a U.S. territory since 1898, has sovereign powers akin to any of the 50 U.S. states. The double jeopardy clause allows U.S. states and the federal government to prosecute people separately for the same actions because they are separate sovereign entities. The Supreme Court, in a ruling authored by Justice Elena Kagan, said that the original source of power for Puerto Rico’s Constitution came from the U.S. Congress, via a 1950 law. “Put simply, Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges,” Kagan wrote. Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, and Stephen Breyer dissented. Some experts saw the federal government’s argument against treating Puerto Rico as a separate governmental entity as having implications for another issue: how to deal with the territory’s debt crisis. In such a scenario, that argument could help establish a legal precedent that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity, possibly to justify imposing a federal control board or some other mechanism to address Puerto Rico’s roughly $70 billion in debt. The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation on the issue. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of the month in another case involving Puerto Rico’s bid to revive a law that would allow it to cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities in a key test in its quest to weather its crisis.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-puertorico-idUSKCN0YV1Y5,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. House passes Puerto Rico debt relief bill,Richard Cowan,6/9/16,"Following months of internal wrangling, the U.S. House of Representatives, on Thursday passed legislation creating a federal control board to help Puerto Rico cope with crippling debt that is wreaking havoc throughout the island’s economy. A worker takes off U.S and Puerto Rican flag after rally of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 16, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin Baez By a vote of 297127, the House approved the bill, sending it to the Senate for consideration. Some leading Democratic senators have voiced concerns about provisions, including one that potentially could reduce the minimum wage for young Puerto Ricans. But given the overwhelming support in the House and a looming July 1 deadline for Puerto Rico to make a $1. 9 billion debt payment, senators may be hesitant to delay or tinker very much with the bill. Following the House vote, the White House in a statement urged the Senate to act promptly “so the president can sign the bill into law ahead of the critical July 1st debt payment deadline. ”The legislation was bolstered by rare bipartisan cooperation between the White House and the House’s Republicans and Democrats over the past six months. House Speaker Paul Ryan urged Congress to act quickly on the “Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act” (PROMESA), warning lawmakers of a “deepening crisis” on the island. “Now the island is shutting down,” Ryan said, with “closed schools; hospitals are beginning to close, that’s today. Tomorrow there could be policemen without cars, there could be blackouts at hospitals. ”Nevertheless, some lawmakers feared that allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its $70 billion debt in a way that changes the seniority of the creditors ,for instance by making them all equal or subordinated to pensioners ,would set a bad precedent for other U.S. states with debt problems. Puerto Rico does not enjoy Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, unlike the 50 U.S. states. The territory, which has a 45 percent poverty rate amid high unemployment, is also plagued by a growing migration of residents to the U.S. mainland. Puerto Rico’s debt problems come as its government and healthcare industry struggle to contain the spread of the Zika virus, which is blamed for severe birth defects and other neurological diseases. On Tuesday, Aeromed, the island’s only active air ambulance company, announced it was suspending its services, blaming the large government debt. The oversight board would be tasked with working with investors on restructuring the U.S. territory’s $70 billion debt. Before passage, the House approved an amendment giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Representative Raul Grijalva, like many Democrats, criticized major elements of the bill but argued it was the best possible in the Republicancontrolled Congress. “The oversight board is too powerful and is yet another infringement on the sovereignty of the people of Puerto Rico and they are right to find it offensive,” Grijalva said. Despite its support for the overall bill, the White House noted that minimum wage and other labor provisions “further exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States” and “do nothing to address the (debt) crisis. ”Supporters praised PROMESA for not using taxpayer funds to help the island reschedule its debt. Failure to pass it, they warned, could put Congress in the difficult position of ultimately overseeing a massive bailout of Puerto Rico. But lawmakers have been buffeted by an opposition lobbying campaign by some hedge funds, which fear losing part of their investments from oversight board decisions.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-house-idUSKCN0YV2CL,Reuters,Neutral

Garcia Padilla arrived in Havana on Thursday to attend as an observer Saturday’s summit of the Association of Caribbean States, which includes as members and associate members virtually all Caribbean Basin nations, as well as a number of islands that are not independent. “We have had meetings with various ministers, and last night I had the opportunity to share some words with President Raul Castro,” Garcia Padilla said. “We had on the agenda and achieved taking the first steps to open an office of Puerto Rico in Havana. What these offices do is promote trade and cultural exchanges,” he said. Puerto Rico has experienced a decline in tourism due to the Zika epidemic. It is expected to suffer further when U.S. tourism opens up with Cuba. Garcia Padilla said while Zika was a threat to pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant, it otherwise represented no danger for visitors,Public health, and in particular efforts in both countries to stem the spread of the Zika virus, was nevertheless on the governor’s agenda. “We had some initial discussions about how we can help each other … as we always do with Caribbean countries to deal with natural disasters,” Garcia Padilla said. Although a number of U.S. governors have visited Cuba since the two countries announced détente in December 2014, restored diplomatic relations six months later and began talks on a multiple of issues, Puerto Rico has a special significance for both countries. The two Caribbean islands were Spanish colonies until the SpanishAmerican war of 1898, when they passed over to the United States. Cuba was quickly granted independence, while Puerto Rico remained an unincorporated territory and in 1952 became a commonwealth of the United States. Since the 1959 Revolution, Cuba has made support for Puerto Rican independence a key part of its foreign policy despite repeated votes in Puerto Rico to maintain its status. “The future of Puerto Rico depends on Puerto Ricans, just like Cuba’s future depends on what the Cubans decide,” said Garcia Padilla, who does not favor independence.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-idUSKCN0YQ0UR,Reuters,Neutral

New Puerto Rico debt bill to be unveiled in U.S. Congress,Richard Cowan,5/18/16,"Longawaited legislation will be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday to address Puerto Rico’s deepening debt crisis, according to the chairman of a committee overseeing the territory. Speaking to reporters, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop said, “There will be a bill today,” but added that decisions still must be made on how to appoint members of a board that would oversee the restructuring of Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt. “Congress has very little appetite to actually pick any sort of winners or losers or to propose any real policy conditions here. All they really want to do is pass off the decisions about what gets done to a control board and do so with a view that the control board has the tools to do the job correctly,” said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson. Backers of legislation hope Congress finishes a bill that President Barack Obama could accept before July 1, when the islandterritory faces a $1. 9 billion debt payment. It already has missed a May 1 debt payment of around $400 million to the Government Development Bank. On Wednesday, Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla declared a state of emergency at the U.S. territory’s highway authority and directed that revenues be dedicated to operations and not debt payments. In addition, Puerto Rico is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its tourism industry, while more residents relocate to the U.S. mainland, further hurting the economy. Bishop said the new bill closely resembles the previous version, which stalled in committee and was criticized by some Republican senators as lacking adequate protections for some creditors. He said the new bill still includes provisions that could allow Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a cramdown. Bishop, a Republican, hesitated to say whether the Democratic Obama White House has signed off on the intended bill. “We are moving forward, there is a deal,” Bishop said to reporters. But he said that the process for making board appointments was unresolved. “There will be a solution that I think (the Obama administration) will find profitable,” Bishop said. It was unclear when the HNRC would debate and vote on the legislation. Bishop said amendments to his bill will be allowed to be debated both in committee and during debate in the full House. “Nobody is happy with the bill because so many different people are being asked to compromise on so many different things,” said Hanson.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN0Y91UB,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico declares moratorium on Government Development Bank's debt,Nick Brown,5/1/16,"Puerto Rico’s governor on Sunday declared a moratorium on a $422 million debt payment due Monday by the island’s Government Development Bank, the most significant default yet for the U.S. territory facing a massive economic crisis. The Government Development Bank (GDB) is seen in San Juan, November 30, 2015.    /Alvin Baez/File PhotoGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in a televised speech that he signed the moratorium on Saturday in what he characterized as a “painful decision” based on inaction from the U.S. Congress, which continues to debate a legislative fix for Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt load. Garcia Padilla, addressing Puerto Rico’s 3. 5 million people in Spanish, said the island’s American citizens had sacrificed much for the nation throughout history and asked Congress on many occasions for tools to restructure its financial liabilities. “We do not want a bailout. We haven’t asked for a bailout. We haven’t been offered a bailout,” he said as the U.S. territory’s economic crisis enters its most dire stretch yet. Puerto Rico, a tropical paradise in economic purgatory, faces a $70 billion debt bill it knows it cannot pay, a staggering 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population as citizens flee to the mainland. The legality of this move to invoke the moratorium, which effectively means defaulting on the debt, is almost certain to be challenged by the GDB’s creditors, and could spawn costly lawsuits and perpetuate more economic uncertainty for the island. “One of our operating assumptions is that protracted or chaotic litigation will reduce aggregate recoveries,” Moody’s Investors Service senior credit officer Ted Hampton said. Though island agencies have defaulted in the past, they have been small and isolated. The failure to pay by the GDB could reverberate through the local economy as it serves as Puerto Rico’s primary fiscal agent. “Agencies being able to access money to cover costs on a weektoweek basis is the only thing keeping Puerto Rico’s doors open,” said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson. Related CoveragePuerto Rico declares moratorium on Government Development Bank's debtGDB has held talks with groups holding some of its $4 billion in bonds to try to restructure the debt consensually. The moratorium covers Monday’s payment on the GDB’s 2011 Series B Senior Notes. The missed payment at GDB could mean the beginning of the end to how the bank conducts operations. It could be wound down by a receiver and its deposits shifted to a new entity. Some creditors say government reforms could allow the island to pay its debts without hurting its people, while Garcia Padilla, whose administration has not published annual financial statements since fiscal year 2013, insists it needs relief from debt payments. “The government has known the GDB was a ticking timebomb and yet nothing constructive was done to forestall a default,” said Arturo Porzecanski, economist and sovereign debt expert at American University in Washington, adding that “the approach is symptomatic of all that is wrong with how Puerto Rico has dealt with its deteriorating financial situation. ”The default ratchets up pressure on Congress to find a legislative solution for Puerto Rico, which owes another $1. 9 billion of debt on July 1, including about $777 million in general obligation debt backed by its constitution. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan initially called for a plan by March 31. However, draft legislation from the House Natural Resources Committee, which would put Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight and allow it to restructure debt through a bankruptcylike process, has faced opposition from liberal and conservative wings of both parties.

Senator Hatch raps House's Puerto Rico debt bill,Richard Cowan,4/19/16,"A highranking Republican senator on Tuesday dismissed as “not satisfactory” draft legislation aimed at addressing Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis before a looming debt default on May 1, deepening intraparty divisions on the complex rescue effort. Cars move in the afternoon traffic on the expressway Las Americas in San Juan, December 1, 2015. Puerto Rico made a crucial debt payment on Tuesday but warned that its deteriorating finances could trigger future defaults, as the governor granted the U.S. territory power to take revenues from public agencies.  REUTERS/Alvin Baez  ,RTX1WQWZOrrin Hatch of Utah, who chairs the powerful Senate Finance Committee, told reporters that draft legislation introduced this month by the House Natural Resources Committee is “not satisfactory and it’s not going to work. And we’re not going to be able to pass it over here” in the Senate. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders already were struggling to advance a bill to help Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, deal with its crippling $70 billion debt. Their efforts have been complicated by opposition from some conservative lawmakers, even as they have been negotiating with the Obama administration over details. Some conservative House Republicans, who want to protect creditors’ rights, have balked at an element of the bill that could allow Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, a socalled cramdown debt restructuring. Hatch, too, wants to protect creditors, but said the bill must include cramdown authority to ensure that more senior bondholders, like those holding Puerto Rico’s constitutionally backed public debt, are better protected. “Let’s face it, you’ve got to protect the preferred creditors. If you don’t do that, I mean, you’re violating the rule of law to begin with,” Hatch said, adding that he is working on a different approach to the legislation. The internal division showcases the complexity of the task facing lawmakers ,to keep Puerto Rico’s economy intact, while also protecting the competing interests of 18 classes of bondholders owed money by the island. In a brief interview with  on Tuesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop expressed confidence that once rankandfile House Republicans familiarize themselves with his bill, it will gain momentum. He added that “bondholders and other players” were beginning to contact lawmakers to talk up the legislation. LOOMING DEFAULTTime is of the essence. Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank owes creditors $422 million on May 1, a payment the island’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said it cannot afford. A default at GDB, the primary liquidity source for most of Puerto Rico’s public agencies, would be the island’s most significant default to date. The bill would also create a federal board to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances, but legislators are debating how much power it should have. Hatch on Tuesday said an oversight board would need “the power to resolve the problems. ”“If you don’t give them the power to do that, it’s just another bailout,” he said. “We’ll be back here two years from now. ”Hector Negroni, a prominent municipal finance investor, objects to the draft bill, saying it changes the rules under which debt was sold to investors and puts creditors at the bottom of the pile while ignoring the priority of payments. That pivot will have a more adverse affect on the municipal bond market than any potential default in Puerto Rico, Negroni said on Saturday, in a panel discussion held by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Washington. “So we have a framework here which doesn’t help Puerto Rico, harms the state and local marketplaces by risking an expectation and change in the rules and raising borrowing costs,” he said. “So if it is not for Puerto Rico, and it is not for state and local governments, I’m not sure who this bill is for. ”Representative Steny Hoyer, the secondranking House Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday that the bill is falling victim to intraparty divisions among Republicans. Hoyer said Republicans should collaborate with Democrats to advance a bill by next week that would need the support of only 4050 of the House’s 246 Republicans. That would be a dangerous political step for Speaker Ryan, however, because he would be turning his back on a majority of members of his own political party on a major piece of legislation during an election year. For now, Republicans “seem to be at risk of not doing it at all,” Hoyer said, referring to a Puerto Rico debt relief bill.

Banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and Puerto Rico citizens all hold paper issued by 18 entities on the U.S. commonwealth and many of those investors, if not all, would face a loss. Lawmakers in Congress are being lobbied ,and attacked ,by investor groups that are trying to protect their bottom lines. “They are deceitful,” said Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who leads the House Natural Resources Committee. Bishop said accusations likening the Puerto Rico rescue plan to a government bailout were “crap,” and the plan had the virtue of “protecting taxpayers and not spending government money. ”The rescue plan does, however, adopt some principles of bankruptcy law and that makes it controversial.

Puerto Rico unveils new debt restructuring proposal,Nick Brown,4/11/16,"Puerto Rico on Monday unveiled a revised restructuring proposal that would cut its debt more modestly, offering general obligation holders about 74 cents on the dollar with other creditor classes getting less, as it tries to solve a crushing economic crisis ahead of looming debt payments. Puerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla addresses the audience at the capitol building in San Juan, in this February 29, 2016 file photo. REUTERS/Alvin Baez/FilesThe plan would reduce a $49 billion chunk of the U.S. territory’s debt to between $32. 6 billion and $37. 4 billion by exchanging existing debt for two classes of new bonds, a base bond and a capital appreciation bond. The offer follows counterproposals from various creditor groups to the island’s initial Feb. 1 restructuring plan, under which the same debt would have been cut to $26. 5 billion. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population, all of which threaten to collapse its economy. It owes $422 million on May 1, which Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has said it cannot afford, and another $1. 5 billion in debt payments on July 1. The latest offer would eliminate the interest holiday Puerto Rico had included in its first plan. Likewise, the capital appreciation bond, which is mandatorily payable, would replace the first plan’s socalled “growth bond,” which would have been payable only if Puerto Rico’s economy reached certain benchmarks. The new plan would also include a “local option” for Puerto Rican residents who hold the island’s bonds, who could opt to receive base bonds with a longdated maturity and 2 percent interest. Initial creditor reaction was negative. One creditorside source said the plan “does not represent a shift in strategy” from the first plan, still “based in benchmark trading prices rather than legal and property rights among creditors. ”A second creditor called the plan a “sideshow” as Puerto Rico lobbies federal lawmakers in Washington for a legislative fix for the island’s debt. “But there’s a part of me that’s like, ‘We should just take it,’” the second source said, adding “we’re gonna get run over in Washington, too, and it’s gonna be ugly. ”The U.S. Congress this week is slated to unveil a new draft bill that is expected to propose putting Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight and providing it with authority to restructure some of its debt. Locally, Puerto Rico last week enacted an emergency law allowing Garcia Padilla to issue moratoria on debt as he deems necessary, and the governor declared a state of emergency at the Government Development Bank (GDB), the government’s primary fiscal agent. Under Monday’s restructuring proposal, assuming all Puerto Rico resident creditors accepted the local option, GO bondholders would recover an average of 74 percent of their debt, while holders of debt issued by the island’s sales taxing authority, COFINA, would recover about 57 percent.

REUTERS/Alvin Baez/FilesThe announcement followed Garcia Padilla signing a law this week authorizing him to take steps to avoid receivership at the GDB, the U.S. territory’s primary fiscal agent, and prevent a run on the bank. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population. Garcia Padilla has said the GDB cannot afford the looming payment. While the island has defaulted on small debt payments in the past, a default at GDB would be the most serious yet. This week’s order prevents GDB’s depositors, such as municipalities and public agencies, from withdrawing their money, except to fund essential services. It also suspends minimum reserve requirements at GDB, and prevents the bank from lending money or making payments on debts that it guarantees. However, Garcia Padilla declined to exercise his authority to declare a moratorium on GDB’s own $422 million May 1 debt payment, citing continuing restructuring talks between GDB and its creditors. “The Executive Order establishes reasonable and necessary procedures to preserve liquidity at GDB and allow it to continue its operations for the benefit of the health, safety and welfare of the people,” he said in the statement. The essential services still allowed for withdrawal, in order of priority, include certain federal funds, payroll, and money for police, fire, medical, education and disaster recovery operations. The order establishes a committee of top island officials to manage these disbursements. Local efforts by GDB and other Puerto Rican debt issuers to reach a debt restructuring are running in parallel with plans in the U.S. Congress to draft legislation aimed at solving the island’s economic crisis, possibly by allowing it to restructure debt and putting its finances under federal oversight. A new draft of that legislation is expected next week from the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources. Some Puerto Rico bondholders have criticized Garcia Padilla’s emergency legislation, particularly the authority to issue a moratorium on any debt the governor deems necessary. Daniel Hanson, an analyst at Height Securities, said in a note this week the law could draw lawsuits from creditors. Rating agency Moody’s said in a note on Friday that it would define a nonpayment at GDB as a default “regardless of (a debt) moratorium law’s provisions. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN0X60N1,Reuters,Neutral

The measure, which earlier passed Puerto Rico’s legislature, lets Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the Government Development Bank (GDB), the island’s primary fiscal agent. “This legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs — providing essential services to our people — without fear of retribution,” Garcia Padilla said in a statement. Puerto Rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. Wednesday’s emergency law was rushed into existence as the GDB faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on May 1. Garcia Padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. GDB and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. But the new law could spark “a new era of litigation” from creditors, said Daniel Hanson, an analyst with Height Securities. “We believe the overwhelming majority of Puerto Rican issuers have violated their creditors’ rights,” he said in a Wednesday note. REBUKE AND PRAISESome GDB creditors on Monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. The passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at PREPA, the island’s power utility. That deal, under which creditors agreed to take 15 percent repayment cuts, “should be explicitly preserved, rather than being cast into a state of uncertainty,” Spencer said in a statement. He said the law could “close the door to anyone extending new credit to Puerto Rico, seriously impeding its ability to meet citizens’ needs. ”In a statement on Wednesday night, PREPA Executive Director Javier Quintana Mendez said the agreement “remains in place and should not be negatively affected by the new law. ”“We continue working in collaboration with our creditors, focused on the implementation of our recovery plan,” Quintana said. A second group of creditors holding debt issued by Puerto Rico’s sales tax authority, COFINA, expressed support for the debt freeze bill, citing delays in legislative efforts by federal lawmakers in Washington to address Puerto Rico’s crisis. “With entrenched private institutions obstructing the legislative process in Washington, it is understandable that Puerto Rican leaders are taking steps to equip the island with the tools it needs,” Susheel Kirpalani, counsel to the COFINA Senior Bondholders Group at law firm Quinn Emanuel, said. A rescue bill being drafted by the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee so far uses U.S. bankruptcy rules as guidance for a solution, something many creditors oppose. Hearings are expected next week in Washington. Relations between Puerto Rico and its creditors are growing tenser as major debt payments in May and July loom. On Tuesday, some of Puerto Rico’s general obligation bondholders criticized the debt moratorium law, at the time still being debated by lawmakers, saying Puerto Rico was ignoring their offer to restructure debt by extending principal payments. Garcia Padilla appeared to fire back on Wednesday, saying “our creditors have engaged in public relations efforts that contain falsehoods about their proposed ‘fixes’ – all of which are aimed at misinforming the public and dissuading Congress from doing what is right for our 3. 5 million American citizens. ”Puerto Rico's benchmark 2035 GO bond 74514LE86=MSRB is down sharply since talk of a debt moratorium bill surfaced earlier this week. On Wednesday the bond fell 2. 45 points in price to bid 63. 299, yielding 13. 33 percent, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data. “Puerto Rico’s problems stopped being legal problems and they’ve started being a math problem. . . at the end of the day Puerto Rico can’t pay,” said Nicholas Venditti, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, speaking at a luncheon for reporters in New York.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-legislatiion-idUSKCN0X31GJ,Reuters,Neutral
"In war on Zika mosquitoes, Puerto Rico starting at 'square one'",Julie Steenhuysen,4/1/16,"The United States faces its first real challenge with the Zika virus on the island territory of Puerto Rico, a part of the nation that is perhaps least prepared to cope with what is expected to be its worst outbreak. A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan, in this January 27, 2016, file photo. REUTERS/Alvin Baez/Files Zika is spreading rapidly in Puerto Rico and is expected to peak in late summer and early fall. By year’s end, public health officials estimate, hundreds of thousands of people will have been infected. It is the only part of the country that is experiencing a major local outbreak, but the virus is expected to reach southern U.S. states within weeks with warmer temperatures and rising mosquito populations. Health officials from across the United States are gathering today at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to outline a national strategy for combating Zika. In a measure of the concern surrounding the outbreak in Puerto Rico, CDC director Tom Frieden toured the island, meeting with top health officials and local experts last month to assess the situation firsthand. Puerto Rico is beset with problems already hampering the response: abundant mosquitoes, high levels of insecticide resistance and economic woes that have left vector control in shambles. “We don’t have good surveillance” here, Frieden said in an interview at the Puerto Rican health department in San Juan during his tour. “We don’t have good control measures. ”First detected in Brazil last year, the Zika outbreak is spreading through the Americas. The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency last month because of growing evidence that Zika can cause microcephaly, a rare birth defect defined by an unusually small head. In adults, the virus has been linked to the typically rare autoimmune disorder, GuillainBarre syndrome. EARLY LESSONSFighting Zika in Puerto Rico is complicated by the toll of a decadelong recession. Nearly half of its 3. 5 million residents live in poverty, and mosquitoes are an accepted nuisance. Puerto Rico has seen repeated outbreaks of dengue and more recently, chikungunya. Both viruses are carried by Aedes aegypti, the same species of mosquito that carries Zika. “Here in Puerto Rico, we’re really starting from square one,” said Audrey Lenhart, a CDC vector control expert in an interview at the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center in San Juan. In its latest report, the Puerto Rican health department said there are now 350 confirmed cases of Zika infection, including 40 pregnant women. “We have a very serious combination of problems,” said Dr. Alberto de la Vega, an obstetrician specializing in highrisk pregnancies at San Juan’s University Hospital at the Puerto Rico Medical Center. “If you don’t have access to money to buy repellent, to sleep with an air conditioner on so mosquitoes won’t bite you, to have mosquito nets around you and you live in areas where there’s more stagnant water, obviously you have higher risks,” he said. To mitigate the risk of microcephaly among newborns, the CDC and the Puerto Rican government are distributing Zika protection kits to pregnant women that include condoms to prevent sexual transmission from an infected partner, insect repellent, bed nets and larvicide tablets for standing water that cannot be drained. De la Vega says many locals are resigned to the idea that everyone in Puerto Rico will be infected. He said he won’t accept that people are “surrendering like that. ”NO VECTOR CONTROLGovernment mosquito abatement resources are scarce, with fewer than a dozen trucks equipped with insecticide sprayers. Of the municipalities that do have trucks, most are used to kill nuisance mosquitoes that bite but do not carry disease, said Manuel Lluberas, a Puerto Ricoborn entomologist who works at H. D. Hudson Manufacturing, a maker of spraying equipment. Lluberas, who advises the WHO and the World Bank on vector control programs, said there are a few municipalities that spray insecticide once every seven to 10 days or once every few weeks. Spraying “needs to be done a lot more frequently” to be effective, he said. Scientists at CDC’s Dengue Laboratory in San Juan have been testing insecticides on mosquitoes gathered from 17 sites on the island. Frieden said in one of the experiments, mosquitoes placed in bottles coated with a commonly effective insecticide “were happily flying around. ”Eliminating Zika will require spraying insecticide indoors on walls, under beds, behind furniture and inside closets, where Aedes aegypti hide. So far, only two insecticides ,deltamethrin and bifenthrin ,are approved for indoor residual spraying, and researchers have found high levels of resistance to bifenthrin in Puerto Rico. Mosquito experts have found similar resistance in parts of Texas and California. “You find resistance in mosquitoes in one locale, and 20 miles away they are not resistant,” said Joseph Conlon, technical advisor for the American Mosquito Control Association, which represents researchers, public health officials and pesticide makers. Dr. Janet McAllister, a CDC entomologist, said indoor spraying campaigns will be carried out by local contractors, who will target only areas where the mosquitoes hide instead of coating entire walls, as is typically done to control mosquitoes that carry malaria. “People would not really be coming into direct contact with those surfaces,” McAllister said. She said the CDC does not plan to use experimental methods, including genetically modified mosquitoes, such as those from Intrexon’s Oxitec now being tested in Brazil, or those infected with Wolbochia bacteria that prevent Zika transmission. Given the urgency of the outbreak, health officials need to focus on known methods of curbing mosquitoes “rather than doing research on things that may or may not work,” she said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-mosquitoes-idUSKCN0WY3SB,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico draft rescue bill guided by U.S. bankruptcy rules,Patrick Rucker,3/29/16,"A U.S. congressional draft bill to steer Puerto Rico through its economic crisis was released on Tuesday with elements of U.S. bankruptcy law opposed by creditors who want to keep the island’s debt talks out of court. A woman walks past clothes for sale and signs reading ""Closing down sale"" in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, June 29, 2015. REUTERS/Alvin BaezHernandez  The draft, circulated by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, includes sections of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that allow bankrupt entities under certain circumstances to force creditors to take reduced payouts. An official draft of the bill is expected to be released on April 11 after a public comment period. Puerto Rico has $70 billion in debt, with major bond payments due in coming months. It also has an unfunded state pension liability of nearly $44 billion. The bill “provides Puerto Rico with tools to impose discipline over its finances, meet its obligations and restore confidence in its institutions,” Utah Republican Rob Bishop, the committee’s chairman, said in a statement. “We appreciate the constructive efforts by Chairman Bishop and the House Natural Resources Committee to begin drafting legislation to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic crisis. But the current draft needs improvements,” said a statement from a Treasury spokesperson. “Final legislation must provide Puerto Rico with tools to achieve a lasting, workable solution to this crisis and create a path to recovery for the people of Puerto Rico. ”The Republicanled panel’s bill would create a federal board to oversee the island’s finances, monitor its accounting and help curb spending. It would also require Puerto Rico to make efforts to restructure debt consensually with creditors. If those talks failed, the island or its public entities could file for a courtsupervised debt restructuring process based on key statutes within U.S. bankruptcy law. That would allow Puerto Rico to force such deals on holdout creditors. The bill’s elements were unexpected because creditors and House Republicans had largely opposed bankruptcy for Puerto Rico. The Natural Resources Committee had said that “retroactively adding territories” like Puerto Rico to the federal bankruptcy code “is illconceived and would undermine the rule of law. ”A congressional aide stressed that the draft legislation was not a bankruptcy law, and does not directly add Puerto Rico to U.S. bankruptcy code, though it follows similar language. The Obama Administration has advocated to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt in a courtsanctioned process. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the “sweeping powers of the oversight board proposed” in the bill. The bill in its final form may include language that protects an existing consensual restructuring deal between creditors and the power utility, PREPA, the congressional aide said. PREPA earlier this year reached the deal with creditors holding roughly 70 percent of its $8. 3 billion in debt. “The bill in its current form is fiscally irresponsible,” financial adviser Stephen Spencer of Houlihan Lokey said in an emailed statement. The company’s clients include major Puerto Rico creditors such as OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers. “As we showed with the PREPA deal, fair solutions can be reached between Puerto Rico and its creditors that benefit all stakeholders. However, the Discussion Draft Bill is worse for creditors than Chapter 9,” Spencer said. How the oversight board treats the island’s General Obligation bonds, which is typically regarded as the most senior debt, versus pension payments is also a source of concern for creditors. The oversight board will look at each bond issued and make a determination on how it relates to other creditors under the existing law, the congressional aide said. If the GO bonds are constitutionally protected and within their limits then the board would take that into consideration, the aide said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-congress-idUSKCN0WW015,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. Supreme Court takes up Puerto Rico bribery case,Lawrence Hurley,3/28/16,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider a former Puerto Rico state senator’s claim that he cannot be retried on corruption charges involving a trip to Las Vegas to watch a boxing bout after his original conviction was thrown out. The court said it would hear an appeal filed by Hector Martinez Maldonado, who served in Puerto Rico’s Senate from 2005 until his 2011 conviction, and businessman Juan Bravo Fernandez, the former president of a private security company. Bravo Fernandez sought to bribe Martinez Maldonado in order to win passage of bills that would benefit his business, according to prosecutors. The case focused in part on allegations that Bravo Fernandez paid for Martinez Maldonado to travel to Las Vegas in 2005 to watch a boxing match involving Puerto Rican fighter Felix “Tito” Trinidad. In 2011, both were convicted for their role in the alleged bribery scheme, but the Bostonbased 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out their convictions in 2013. Federal prosecutors said they would seek a new trial. But Martinez Maldonado and Bravo Fernandez said a new trial should be barred because it would violate the constitutional protection against “double jeopardy,” which prevents people from being tried on charges for which they already have been acquitted. Their lawyers say double jeopardy applies because the jury had acquitted the two men of some of the criminal charges concerning conduct closely related to the actions on which the retrial would be focused. The appeals court ruled in favor of the prosecution last year. It is the third case concerning Puerto Rico that the Supreme Court has taken up recently. Last week, the justices heard oral arguments over the U.S. Caribbean territory’s bid to revive a law that would allow it to cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities. .

Puerto Rico needs freeze on lawsuits to face debt crisis: governor,Reuters Staff,3/17/16,"The U.S. Congress must protect Puerto Rico from investor lawsuits so that the island’s government can face a debt crisis and address what the U.S. territory’s governor describes as a building humanitarian crisis, he said on Thursday. Puerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla addresses the media after a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew (not pictured) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, January 20, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin Baez  Leaders in Congress agree that Puerto Rico needs an independent board to help face $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, but Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said the island needs more urgent help. “Congress can legislate a stay on any legal action until that oversight board kicks in,” Padilla told reporters on a conference call. Financial woes mean Puerto Rico cannot confront the Zika virus as it should, Padilla said, citing estimates that more than 20 percent of island residents could be infected this year with the virus linked to birth defects. School septic tanks, a mosquito breeding ground, are overflowing in Puerto Rico, which lacks money to pay contractors to empty them, Padilla said. “The humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico is real and continues to grow with each passing day. ”The government of Puerto Rico highlighted the territory owes vendors, including those who provide gasoline to police and fire departments and maintain schools, $1. 9 billion. In addition, it has yet to pay out $50 million in 2014 tax refunds. The White House and Congress agree that Puerto Rico cannot face its financial crisis alone but leaders have not agreed on whether the island should be able to seek relief in the courts. Puerto Rico cannot use bankruptcy laws to address its debt problems, tools that were available 20 years ago. Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has promised to have a Puerto Rico rescue bill before the end of the month and Padilla has applauded that commitment. That bill, though, will create an oversight board to negotiate with creditors rather than granting Puerto Rico immediate protection akin to bankruptcy, according to Congressional sources familiar with the draft legislation. Democratic leaders this week outlined a different plan: allow Puerto Rico time, perhaps as much as a year, for some breathing room to work out a deal with a stay on its debt payments. Republican and Democratic leaders, along with the Treasury Department, will likely have to hash out details of a bill but Padilla said granting a stay on investor lawsuits was a needed interim step. Congressional Republicans working on the Puerto Rico legislation have not decided whether they have the authority to freeze investor lawsuits or whether doing so would cause more confusion, said the sources. Puerto Rico negotiated a restructuring of debt owed by the power utility, known by its initials as PREPA, but even then it was a partial solution. Padilla said PREPA, which accounts for 14 percent of the territory’s overall debt load, took 19 months to reach a deal with 62 percent of the power utility’s creditors. “That is maybe the showcase on why Congress need(s) to approve the framework, the legal framework and to help with the holdouts,” Padilla said. Negotiations are ongoing, he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN0WJ21V,Reuters,Neutral
CDC director calls Zika in Puerto Rico a 'challenge and crisis',Julie Steenhuysen,3/8/16,"During a tour of Zika preparations in Puerto Rico, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Zika a “tremendous challenge and crisis” and said protecting pregnant women from the virus is a top priority. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are seen at the Laboratory of Entomology and Ecology of the Dengue Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in San Juan, March 6, 2016. Picture taken March 6, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin Baez In Brazil, Zika has been linked to a spike in cases of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains. “Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects,” Frieden told reporters Tuesday at a briefing in Puerto Rico’s health department. Frieden has been working with CDC staff and the Puerto Rican government on strategies to protect pregnant from becoming infected with the mosquitoborne virus, which Frieden called a top priority. In Puerto Rico, the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika is widespread, and Frieden said controlling it will require a multipronged approach involving government, municipalities, neighbors, families and society at large. Cases of Zika are doubling weekly in Puerto Rico, and the CDC expects hundreds of thousands of individuals will become infected, including thousands of pregnant women. To protect pregnant women, Frieden recommended using insect repellent daily and reliably. He also suggested adding window screens and air conditioning, where possible. And he called for reducing standing water in and around homes to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats. Frieden’s comments, delivered mostly in Spanish, followed two days of briefings with staff at the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center in San Juan. CDC researchers are monitoring the outbreak and studying the best ways to prevent Zika infections through education campaigns, and the distribution of Zika prevention kits for pregnant women. Slideshow ( 2 images )Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly in babies. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 640 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 4,200 additional suspected cases of microcephaly. At the CDC’s Dengue Branch in Puerto Rico, scientists are conducting research on the most effective mosquito control measures, and processing diagnostic tests from blood samples delivered daily to the laboratory. Dr. Jorge Munoz, branch director, said in an interview they are capable of processing 400 to 500 blood samples a week. Scientists at the laboratory developed a triple test that can detect Zika, dengue and chikungunya ,three different viruses carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that is endemic in Puerto Rico. Late last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency authorization to use this testing in health departments across the United States to sort out whether an infection was caused by Zika or one of the two related viruses. The test will be crucial in helping to quickly sort out whether Zika was the cause of an infection or whether it was dengue and chikungunya, which also cause infection and illness. “Puerto Rico is in a very different situation from the rest of the United States,” Frieden told the briefing. Besides the high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Puerto Rico has a lot of housing without window screens or air conditioning. “The combination of those two things, when you add Zika in, means the likelihood of a very large number of cases,” Frieden said. “In rest of the United States, we may see clusters,” he said. But if Zika behaves the way chikungunya and dengue have, “we will not see widespread transmission. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-frieden-idUSKCN0WA2V1,Reuters,Neutral
U.S. Treasury pushed plan to protect Puerto Rico pensioners more than creditors: document,Nick Brown,2/25/16,"The U.S. Treasury envisioned giving Puerto Rico’s pensioners stronger legal protection than holders of its constitutionallybacked bonds if it went bankrupt, according to a draft of a proposed plan obtained by . The draft, circulated in Washington late last year but not made public in the runup to President Barack Obama’s Omnibus budget, imagined a broad structure aimed at protecting citizens while providing flexibility to cut debt, an approach consistent with what Puerto Rico’s leaders have sought. One source familiar with the document and a second Congressional source said Treasury was involved in crafting it with senators from both parties, although it was unclear who wrote it. One of those sources said Senate Republicans ultimately walked away from the effort over the language of the proposal. “The (Obama) Administration put forward a legislative proposal to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis in October,” Treasury spokesman Daniel Watson said, adding that “the proposal includes a legal framework that allows for a comprehensive restructuring of Puerto Rico’s debts. ”The Treasury did not confirm the authenticity of the document, while a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico did not respond to a request for comment. The fate of Puerto Rico, facing $70 billion in debt, is a hot topic in Washington. While the Treasury draft will likely differ from any formal legislation proposed in a Republicancontrolled Congress, it gives insight into the Obama administration’s approach. An effort to draft new legislation for the indebted island is expected to begin in earnest after two congressional hearings set for Thursday in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans plan to bring a bill addressing Puerto Rico’s debt crisis to the floor of the House by the end of March. The island has lobbied for access to a bankruptcylike mechanism to reduce debt, a view supported by the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats but one that has met with some pushback from Republicans who want to protect creditors’ interests. In Treasury’s proposal, language protecting pensioners in a bankruptcy setting is stronger than language protecting bondholders. A debt restructuring plan could be confirmed by a judge if it “does not unduly impair the claims of any class of pensioners,” and “if feasible, [it] does not unduly impair” general obligation (GO) debt, the draft said. “This language gives a debtor latitude to give better treatment to pensions than to GOs,” something that would make it “far more controversial” to creditors, said Melissa Jacoby, a bankruptcy expert and professor at UNCChapel Hill. The proposal would also require struggling territories to submit fiscal plans that “provide adequate funding for public pensions” but reduce “the debt burden to a level that is sustainable. ”Puerto Rico’s biggest pensions face a combined funding shortfall of roughly $43. 5 billion, or 96 percent, and are projected to run out of assets by about 2019.

Puerto Rico needs restructuring to avoid cascading defaults: Treasury,Megan Davies,2/25/16,"U.S. Treasury counselor Antonio Weiss said on Thursday that without a proper restructuring regime, Puerto Rico will default and litigation will intensify, as he pushed Congress to act with legislation to help the island fix its crisis. Weiss, speaking to the House Natural Resources Committee in a hearing about the island’s fiscal crisis, outlined the scale of the problems the U.S. territory faces. “As the cascading defaults and litigation unfold, there is real risk of another lost decade, this one more damaging than the last,” Weiss said. A legislative solution for Puerto Rico, battling with $70 billion debt, may be edging closer. Legislation to find a fix for the island is expected to be drawn up following two Congressional hearings on Thursday ,one in front of the House Natural Resources Committee at which Weiss was the sole witness. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he wants the Republicanled House to develop a response to Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis during the first quarter of 2016, and Republicans plan to bring a bill addressing the crisis to the House floor by the end of March. Puerto Rico wants access to a bankruptcylike mechanism to reduce debt ,a view backed by President Barack Obama’s administration and some Congressional Democrats. But majority Republicans have not supported efforts to extend bankruptcy protection to the island, a strategy which could be detrimental to some creditors, and are keen to put Puerto Rico under strict fiscal oversight. Weiss, in questioning, said that Treasury’s restructuring proposal was not envisioning the Chapter 9 bankruptcy law U.S. states can access for their public agencies, but legislation “customized to the unique conditions that face Puerto Rico. ”Weiss said his team will have to work to convince island leaders of the need for an oversight board for the island. “I think the legislature doesn’t fully understand what this oversight authority would consist of,” he said. Puerto Rico, with a 45 percent poverty rate, has been in recession for nearly a decade and is losing population to the mainland. It is suffering from a huge debt buildup and has already defaulted on some borrowings. “There is fear of the future,” said Weiss. “Puerto Ricans are leaving and are joining us on the mainland where they find access to jobs, a future for their children, better healthcare. ”Weiss said that a failure to protect pension payments would “irreparably harm retirees” and add greater stress to Puerto Rico’s economy. “We are deeply concerned about the pensions in Puerto Rico,” he said. The Treasury late last year envisioned giving Puerto Rico’s pensioners stronger legal protection than holders of its constitutionally backed bonds if it went bankrupt, according to a draft of a proposed plan seen by . A separate hearing before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services focused on the impact to investors in the $3. 7 trillion municipal bond market. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said without a broad restructuring framework to include more of the debt than a Chapter 9 framework would envision, the issue would not be solved and “we will be back here again. ”Legislation for Puerto Rico could potentially be written as a standalone law, which carries the risk of having little momentum to approve it, or attached to a bill related to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a congressional source previously said. An FAA authorization bill which authorizes funding for the agency could come up for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as next month. However, a legislative solution may be hard to achieve given the differing views and acrimonious relationship between Republicans, which control Congress, and Democrats. Tom McClintock, a Republican of California, said instead of increasing regulation, Puerto Rico needs less red tape, less tax burden and could be turned into a “Hong Kong of the Caribbean. ”However, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho said he appreciated that Weiss was “trying to find a solution. ”“We don’t agree on every one of your solutions but I can tell that the administration is acting in good faith in finding a solution to the problem,” Labrador said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKCN0VY1J0,Reuters,Neutral
Zika-hit Puerto Rico prepares to import all of its blood supplies,Toni Clarke,2/19/16,"New guidelines barring the collection of blood in areas with outbreaks of the mosquitoborne Zika virus will be put to the test first in cashstrapped Puerto Rico, where health officials have two weeks to start importing the island’s supply. People read information on Zika virus and other mosquitoborne diseases at the Department of Health in San Juan, January 27, 2016. REUTERS/Alvin Baez  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this week that areas with active domestic transmission of Zika virus should stop collecting blood locally. Puerto Rico has reported a small number of cases of local transmission, and U.S. health officials expect many thousands of residents to be infected once the mosquito season reaches its peak this summer. Local health officials fear switching to imports could undermine the island’s voluntary donation network, which provides the bulk of its needs. The new guidelines will require Puerto Rico to obtain its entire supply from the continental United States at a cost of up to $100,000 a week, said Jose O. Alsina, vice president and chief operating officer of Puerto Rico’s Banco de Sangre de Servicios Mutuos, the island’s largest blood bank. The U.S. territory is struggling with about $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate. The island has already defaulted on some debt payments and its Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has warned that the government is close to running out of money. Alsina said its eight blood banks can’t afford to buy blood and make payroll, which includes about 400 drivers, phlebotomists, nurses and others. Blood bank officials are asking the government to help pay for the imports so they can maintain their infrastructure until local collection can resume. They also have asked for extra time to collect blood locally before having to import it all. “Laying off people, even for a short time, would be devastating,” Alsina said. The FDA said that it recognized the new rules would create hardships but stressed they were necessary to ensure safety. The Zika virus has been found in blood, and experts are concerned about the possibility that it could be transmitted through transfusion. The FDA “is actively engaged in conversations with local health authorities and blood collection establishments in Puerto Rico in order to minimize the impact to the greatest extent possible,” said agency spokeswoman Tara Goodin. The Zika outbreak began in Brazil last year and has spread rapidly through the Americas. The World Health Organization declared it a global health emergency earlier this month because the virus is suspected of causing microcephaly, a birth defect marked by unusually small heads that can cause developmental disabilities. President Barack Obama has asked Congress to approve $1. 8 billion in supplemental emergency funding to help combat the virus, with $250 million designated for Puerto Rico. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has told lawmakers some of the funds should finance the development of a blood screening test that he hoped could be available in six to 12 months. TEMPORARY TESTIn the meantime, researchers at the Blood Systems Research Institute (BSRI), a unit of the blood and transfusion services company Blood Systems Inc, are evaluating the possibility of refining an existing Zika test to temporarily screen blood from Puerto Rico. The test was developed nearly a decade ago by the CDC and has been used mainly for research purposes. Dr. Michael Busch, director of the BSRI said he believes his institute could refine the test and screen the Puerto Rican blood supply until a commercial test becomes available later this year. Busch said the institute is in discussions with the FDA and believes it could scale up capacity to test Puerto Rican blood donations and submit an application for approval by the end of March. The CDC test could screen the average amount of blood Puerto Rico uses per week but not much more, Busch said. The U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa also have been identified by CDC as areas with active Zika transmission, but both already import their blood supply from the continental United States and Hawaii, respectively, the FDA said. U.S. health officials expect to see localized outbreaks in the southeastern United States later this year. The further the virus spreads, the greater the area that will need to be supplied by Zikafree regions of the country, potentially squeezing overall blood supply. OneBlood, which collects most of the blood used in Florida, said it will implement a screening test as soon as one is authorized by the FDA. The organization is in “close contact” with the FDA, CDC and Florida Department of health “should additional measures be needed,” said spokesman Pat Michaels.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-blood-insight-idUSKCN0VS0FI,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico declares public health emergency over Zika virus,Megan Davies,2/5/16,"Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla on Friday declared a public health emergency because of the mosquitoborne Zika virus, a government statement said. Puerto Rican health officials have confirmed 22 cases, including a pregnant woman and a man with Zika who developed GuillainBarre syndrome, a separate government statement said. GuillainBarre is a rare disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves. Health authorities would track the Zika cases and report results weekly, the government said. The virus is having an impact on tourism, with some tourist groups canceling reservations, particularly weddings in hotels on the Caribbean island. There were no reports of conventions being canceled, the statement said. Puerto Rico reported its first case of Zika in December, the virus having emerged at a difficult time for the U.S. territory as it tries to resolve an economic and fiscal crisis. The island, struggling to restructure its debt, will run out of fiscal emergency measures by June, the Government Development Bank president said on Friday.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-puertorico-idUSKCN0VE250,Reuters,Neutral
Democrats to demand restructuring mechanism for Puerto Rico: letter,Nick Brown,1/22/16,"Democratic U.S. senators have drafted a letter to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisting legislation designed to solve Puerto Rico’s debt crisis should include a mechanism for the island to restructure its debt, according to a draft of the letter seen by . U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (RKY)  speaks during an event at the U.S. Capitol in Washington December 9, 2015.   REUTERS/Joshua Roberts The move is a challenge to Republicans pushing bills in Congress to bring Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight, who are generally opposed to letting the U.S. commonwealth restructure its debt. Democrats have argued that any such oversight should be conditional on allowing Puerto Rico to be governed by federal bankruptcy or debt restructuring laws. A congressional source familiar with the letter said Senate democrats plan to make it public on Tuesday ahead of a hearing on Puerto Rico by the House Committee on Natural Resources, but timing remains uncertain. A solution “must allow Puerto Rico to restructure a meaningful portion of its debt,” according to the draft of the letter, which noted that “Puerto Rico was included in Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code until 1984, when Congress inexplicably excluded it from the nationwide approach to resolving municipal insolvency. ”Letters such as this are generally aimed at demonstrating party unity and are typically circulated to collect as many signatures as possible to show strength on a given issue. The congressional source said this letter’s authors are expecting signatures from all 44 Democratic senators and 2 independent senators. If such broad support were achieved, it would allow Democrats to block any legislation that did not include a restructuring mechanism ,although that is no guarantee that Republicans, who control Congress, would draft a bill that includes one. Related CoveragePuerto Rico PREPA's declines offer for fresh debt deal deadlineA restructuring option would be a coup for the island’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who has long said Puerto Rico needs to cut its $70 billion in debt to grow its economy, a stance that has faced resistance from creditors. Aside from its debt load, Puerto Rico faces widespread economic strain, including a 45percent poverty rate and a shrinking tax base, as a growing number of citizens jump to the mainland United States. The island has begun skipping some debt payments in recent months in order to make others, and now faces lawsuits from insurers of some bonds.

The lawsuit by Assured Guaranty and Ambac Financial, filed in U.S. federal court in Puerto Rico, asks a judge to declare that Puerto Rico violated the U.S. constitution when it diverted $163 million from revenue streams meant to pay debt at the island’s infrastructure, highway and other agencies. It also looks to block Puerto Rico from executing these socalled clawbacks. The lawsuit is an opening salvo in what could be a long and expensive court fight over Puerto Rico’s efforts to restructure its debt. The island lacks access to U.S. bankruptcy protections, and creditors have resisted voluntary concessions, making for a messy and unpredictable path to restructuring. In a statement, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said this will “force a race to the courthouse, adding that “with no legal framework to handle this impending litigation crisis both the Commonwealth and its creditors will soon face the opposite of due process and rule of law. ”In June, Garcia Padilla called the island’s debt load “unpayable” and sought concessions from bondholders. Last month, he said the only way to afford to pay debt backed by Puerto Rico’s constitution was to redirect or “claw back” revenues earmarked for debt at other agencies. The infrastructure authority, PRIFA, missed a $36 million debt payment on Monday as a result of the clawbacks. The plaintiffs argue clawback authority applies only when there is no other money available to pay debt, which Puerto Rico has not proven is the case. The clawbacks “substantially and unjustifiably impair . . . contractual rights,” the insurers alleged. They also said Puerto Rico is wrongfully using clawbacks to fund government services, and is diverting bondholders’ collateral in violation of the Takings and Due Process clauses of the U.S. constitution. The complaint names Garcia Padilla, along with Government Development Bank President Melba Acosta, among its defendants. A spokeswoman for Garcia Padilla’s office had no immediate comment. A 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking tax base have helped push Puerto Rico into an economic quagmire. The lawsuit represents the first chance for a judge to assess the island’s longstanding claims that it faces a humanitarian crisis and needs help from creditors. However, the litigation could prove largely symbolic, as sides are expected to put most of their resources into consensual restructuring talks in the coming months. Ambac insures about $1. 1 billion of debt at the clawedback agencies, while Assured wraps nearly $1. 5 billion, according to the lawsuit.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-lawsuit-idUSKBN0UM0FI20160108,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico shows more evidence of January 1 default with PRIFA bonds shortfall,Reuters Staff,1/5/16,"Puerto Rico’s PRIFA infrastructure authority did not transfer funds to its bond trustee to pay debt due Jan. 1 on certain bonds, according to regulatory filings on Tuesday, further confirmation of a default by the U.S. territory. Harold Lopez (R) reads a newspaper while riding on the metro train in San Juan, December 2, 2015. REUTERS/Alvin Baez  The embattled Caribbean island said last week that it would pay the bulk of $1 billion debt due Jan. 1, but some bond issues would not be met. The debt due was postponed to Jan. 4 due to the holiday. The trustee for PRIFA’s series 2005 B and 2006 bonds said on Tuesday it did not receive sufficient funds from PRIFA for the payment of debt, although it held a small residual amount from prior payments that it allocated to pay interest. Series A bonds’ trustee also disclosed in a separate filing that funds were not received. On Monday, the trustee for its series 2005 C bonds also said it did not receive funds from PRIFA to pay debt service ,which meant a $10. 3 million hit for Ambac Financial which insures some of the debtBond insurer FGIC will pay holders of certain of Series A and C bonds, one of the filings said, and the trustee notified FGIC of a $6. 4 million shortfall of payment on those bonds. Puerto Rico warned last week that PRIFA would not have sufficient funds to make the full payment on its special tax revenue bonds, Series 2005A–C and Series 2006, and $36 million was expected not to be paid. It also warned that it would default on $1. 4 million debt due to its Public Finance Corp while it would claw back $163 million of revenues from several agencies, including the highway authority, the convention center authority and the island’s busing authority in order to pay higher priority bonds. The actions may open the door to possible litigation from affected creditors. According to the series 2005 B and 2006 filing, the bond trust agreement said that if holders of at least 20 percent of bonds request, the trustee shall “protect and enforce its rights” with respect to funds and other moneys pledged thereunder, by “suits, actions or special proceedings”.

"Puerto Rico to default on some debts, will pay GO debt",Nick Brown,12/30/15,"Puerto Rico will default for the second time in five months, but will pay the bulk of $1 billion due on Jan. 4, including its most senior debt, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said on Wednesday.

The Caribbean island’s biggest payment, $328. 7 million in general obligation debt, will be paid, the governor told reporters at a press conference in San Juan. More than half of that payment was made by taking revenues from other commonwealth agencies, he added. A default on general obligation (GO) debt would have been seen as a more serious stumble because those bonds have the strongest legal protections of any of the island’s obligations. However, it also keeps alive the drama surrounding its deteriorating finances and $70 billion debt load as investors wait for the next shoe to drop. The default opens the door to potential litigation from affected creditors, while the island must now turn its focus to trying to achieve a consensual debt restructuring with GO holders before its next big payment of $1. 9 billion is due in July. The governor said he is meeting with creditors in early January, though he did not give a specific date. When asked about a shutdown of key government services, Garcia Padilla told reporters at a press conference: “We have to do all we can to avoid that situation. ”The U.S. Commonwealth, suffering from a near decadelong recession with a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking tax base due to people leaving the island, first defaulted in August when it failed to make the full payment on its Public Finance Corp (PFC) bonds. One creditor source with significant GO holdings said Puerto Rico’s decision to pay GO debt buys it some credibility as debt restructuring talks continue. “I’m glad we can enjoy our holiday, because there’s going to be a lot of heavy lifting to do when we get back,” the source said. David Tawil, cofounder of hedge fund Maglan Capital, said a default of GO bonds is also probably inevitable in the longterm, but that there is a slim possibility that either Congress will take action or a settlement could be reached with creditors ahead of a default. Either way, he warned that Puerto Rico is still in the very early stages of dealing with its massive fiscal challenge. “Citizens need to know that necessary infrastructure and services are there and there is not going to be a government shutdown,” Tawil said. The island will default on a $35. 9 million payment due to its Infrastructure Finance Authority (PRIFA). It will also default on $1. 4 million due to its Public Finance Corp, but will make payments to most other authorities. The island was facing a bill of about $1 billion had it made all payments. Padilla said about $163 million of the GO payment came from clawing back revenues from several agencies, including the highway authority, the convention center authority and the island’s busing authority. Garcia Padilla on Dec. 1 granted the U.S. territory power to take revenues from those agencies to keep payments on GO debt current. “The use of over $100 million in reserved funds to make debt service payments for several of the Commonwealth’s issuers should underscore that the Commonwealth is running out of options to pay its debt,” said Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank. POTENTIAL LAWSUITSThe announcement now opens the door to litigation from holders of defaulted bonds. One creditor source with exposure at one of the clawedback agencies told  lawsuits are being considered and could be filed immediately, but creditors have not decided whether the cost of litigation is worthwhile. Daniel Hanson, an analyst at Height Securities who follows Puerto Rico, said any litigation will focus on Puerto Rico’s credibility. Garcia Padilla has consistently said the island was on the brink of a humanitarian crisis, yet it is able to pay the bulk of its debt and dished out about $120 million in Christmas bonuses this month, Hanson pointed out. Such questions could also hamper Puerto Rico’s efforts to convince U.S. Congress that it is in desperate need of legislative aid, Hanson said. The U.S. Treasury has been pushing Congress to allow the island to restructure its debts under U.S. bankruptcy law. A Treasury spokesman said Wednesday that the latest default “demands swift Congressional action” for a restructuring with independent oversight. The House is expected to hold a Jan. 5 hearing on Puerto Rico’s financial problems. The source with significant GO exposure acknowledged that clawing back certain debt to pay GO holders is legal, but said a lawsuit would likely focus on whether Puerto Rico met the legal requirements needed to exercise clawbacks, namely proving it was cashstrapped and had no other choice. Bond insurer Ambac Financial, which insures about $863 million in PRIFA bonds, on Tuesday wrote a letter to Garcia Padilla challenging whether the clawbacks were used properly under Puerto Rican laws. General obligation bonds with an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035 were slightly higher on Wednesday, traded at an average price of 73 cents on the dollar compared to 71. 726 on Tuesday. The average yield fell to 11. 501 percent from 11. 716. The island owes about $400 million due February 1, mostly to Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corp, or COFINA. The monies for this payment are already held in reserve, Garcia Padilla said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-debt-idUSKBN0UD11B20151230,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico governor: U.S. backtracking on island's independence,Nick Brown,12/28/15,"The United States is backtracking from its historic position acknowledging Puerto Rico’s right to selfgovernance, Puerto Rico’s governor says in a pending U.S. Supreme Court case over socalled double jeopardy laws. In a letter to United Nations SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon released on Sunday, Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said Washington is reversing a decadesold understanding that Puerto Rico, while a U.S. commonwealth, governs through its own constitution. The case plays out against a massive debt restructuring in Puerto Rico and could be a political lightning rod on an island where commonwealth status is the key issue dividing political parties. A 1950 agreement “emphasized that under the Puerto Rico constitution, the political power of the commonwealth emanates from the people and shall be exercised in accordance with their will,” Garcia Padilla wrote in the letter. It came in response to a friendofthecourt brief filed by U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli in a Supreme Court case over whether Puerto Rico can prosecute people for crimes of which they have already been convicted in federal court. Verrilli argued that unlike states, Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign, so prosecution would violate double jeopardy laws that ban trying a defendant twice for the same crime in the same jurisdiction. Puerto Rico could become sovereign “only if it were to attain statehood or become an independent nation,” the United States argued. The U.S. Congress is divided on whether and how the federal government should step in to help Puerto Rico sort out $70 billion in debt, while the island’s financial creditors have been resistant to voluntary cuts on repayments. The Supreme Court case is not directly related to the debt crisis, nor to a separate pending Supreme Court case over whether the island can enact local bankruptcy laws to help it enforce cuts on creditors. Still, the dispute highlights one of the key political issues at the center of Puerto Rico’s restructuring: the nature of its relationship with the United States. Puerto Rican leaders who support statehood, like Pedro Pierluisi, the island’s representative in Congress, say the solicitor general’s brief captures the problem with territory status. “Any lingering illusions about Puerto Rico’s status should be shattered” in light of Verrilli’s brief, Pierluisi said in a statement. “Puerto Rico is a territory ,an undemocratic, unequal and undignified status. ”Garcia Padilla ,a member of the party that opposes statehood for Puerto Rico ,believes the island can be independent as a commonwealth.

"Puerto Rico avoids second default, but future payments uncertain",Megan Davies,12/1/15,"Puerto Rico made a crucial debt payment on Tuesday but warned that its deteriorating finances could trigger future defaults, as the governor granted the U.S. territory power to take revenues from public agencies. The Government Development Bank (GDB) is seen in San Juan, November 30, 2015. /Alvin Baez   There had been speculation Puerto Rico would default on all or part of the $355 million notes issued by its financing arm, the Government Development Bank. The U.S. territory said in a statement that it made the Dec. 1 bond payment despite “extreme fiscal challenges. ”While Puerto Rico first defaulted in August, failure to make the payment on Tuesday would have been more significant because part of that debt was protected by the commonwealth’s constitution. Another default could have triggered lawsuits, further spooked investors and undermined the island’s efforts to climb out of $72 billion in debt and forced it to take drastic measures to keep public services running. Puerto Rico is under pressure to meet payments on government services. For example, it pays Christmas bonuses to public employees, yet officials have said in the past month that it is unclear when and if the government will meet that payment, given the cashflow situation. Moody’s said the ratings agency would “continue to view default as likely on future commonwealth debt payments. ”Puerto Rico’s next deadline is $945 million in total bond payments on Jan. 1, including $363 million in general obligation debt service, Moody’s said. A Puerto Rico executive order signed on Monday by Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said it gives the commonwealth the ability to claw back revenues from certain government agencies, including the highway authority HTA and the infrastructure authority PRIFA. Garcia Padilla told a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that Puerto Rico would have to “claw back revenues pledged to certain bonds issued in order to maintain public services” and to repay bonds issued with the full faith and credit of the commonwealth. An imminent default “looms large,” Garcia Padilla said. “In simple terms, we have begun to default on our debt in an effort to attempt to repay bonds issued with the full faith and credit of the commonwealth and secure sufficient resources to protect the life, health, safety and welfare of the people of Puerto Rico,” the governor said in written testimony. Related CoveragePuerto Rico executive order grants power to take revenues from HTA, PRIFAPuerto Rico makes bond payment by redirecting revenueJustice Secretary Cesar Miranda said that the clawbacks “could be interpreted as a technical default, in the way that we retain money destined to eventually pay a debt when due” and said it could open the door to litigation. Puerto Rico’s 8 percent General Obligation Bond rallied to trade at an average price of 74. 9 cents on the dollar, with a yield dropping to 11. 2 percent versus a yield of 11. 8 percent on Monday, on news that it did not default on the GDB debt. With 45 percent of its 3. 5 million population in poverty, Puerto Rico is a meteorological paradise mired in economic purgatory. Years of overspending and the expiration of corporate tax incentives stuck it with debt that gets harder to pay as residents increasingly emigrate to the United States. “Puerto Rico’s debt crisis didn’t happen overnight, it’s been years in the making,” said Senator Chuck Grassley, who chaired the committee at Tuesday’s hearing. “The starting point is to identify the problem. ”Puerto Rico is in the process of trying to negotiate a debt restructuring with investors which could involve a socalled superbond that provides just one credit for various existing bonds. One source familiar with the situation said negotiations had been going slowly and will now probably drag into next summer as the GDB payment buys some time. “This just really buys a bit more time for the Commonwealth, but the Puerto Rico leadership better act fast with respect to bond holder negotiations if they want these payments to have been worthwhile,” said David Tawil, president at hedge fund Maglan Capital. Of the $355 million paid on Tuesday, $81. 4 million was to service nongeneral obligationbacked debt and $273. 3 million was for notes backed by the commonwealth’s general obligation guarantee. The payment on bonds issued by the GDB was crucial as Puerto Rico tries to stretch its liquidity into 2016 to provide more time to restructure debt.

Puerto Rico Governor loses support of mayors as debt crisis bites,Nick Brown,11/25/15,"As Puerto Rico’s debt crisis takes its toll on the U.S. territory’s economy, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla is losing support within his own party, increasing the chances he won’t seek reelection next November. His public approval ratings are dire ,just 12 percent in a recent poll by newspaper El Nuevo Dia ,but more detrimental to his campaign plan is the growing number of mayors and other local politicians from his Popular Democratic Party (PPD) who have deserted him. Support from such officials in Puerto Rico’s towns is crucial for effective governance. The governor’s struggles are good news for the main opposition party, the New Progressive Party (PNP), which in turn may favor holders of the Caribbean island’s $72 billion in debt, including foreign creditors. PNP gubernatorial candidates, who include Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress, and Ricky Rossello, the son of a revered exgovernor, have said they support trying to pay back the island’s creditors, while Garcia Padilla has called the debt “unpayable” and called for concessions from those who hold it. “Creditors would have higher priority in the minds of a PNP candidate,” said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who is closely following Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. But the island’s “budget would likely sustain more cuts,” he said. Garcia Padilla’s predecessor as governor, the PNP’s Luis Fortuno, reduced the government’s workforce by about 15 percent. Garcia Padilla has added some jobs, Hanson said. UPHILL BATTLEGarcia Padilla is scheduled to meet with his party’s mayors’ association ,the most influential party faction ,on December 5, according to mayors interviewed by , and they speculate he will announce his decision very soon after that. Candidates have until December 31 to register. Investors are optimistic about the possibility of a change in the island’s leadership, debt traders said. “A lot of people are waiting on a new administration to negotiate terms,” said Ben Eiler, managing partner at First Southern Securities in Puerto Rico, which trades Puerto Rican debt. “I’d welcome and look forward to a change. ”These are particularly tough times to govern Puerto Rico. The island, with a population of 3. 5 million, has a 45 percent poverty rate. Analysts at Moody’s say the island could default on at least some of a $355 million payment due December 1. Getting help from Washington is seen as an uphill battle, though the U.S. Treasury has recommended changing certain laws to treat Puerto Rico more equitably to U.S. states. Political status is the key dividing issue in Puerto Rico, with the PNP favoring the territory seek to become a U.S. state, and the PPD opposed. Pierluisi has said he would hold a federallyfunded ballot on the question in 2017. MAYORS HOLD THE CARDSUnder Puerto Rico’s electoral system, all political offices are contested on the same day, every four years. With voter turnout rates averaging 80 percent since 2000, whichever party is stronger on election day is likely to enjoy four years of control throughout all levels of government. As a result, weak governors tend to face internal pushback from other elected officials in the ruling party, particularly mayors. Unlike in the U.S. , all Puerto Rican municipalities elect mayors, who can function almost like local campaign branches for governors they support. Mayors in the PPD say Garcia Padilla has done a poor job of communicating and collaborating with them, and missed opportunities to gain their support for a second term and bolster his image in the process. “He could have used the mayors as allies,” said Isidro Negrón Irizarry, PPD mayor of San German, Puerto Rico’s secondoldest town, near its southwestern corner. “He mistakenly sees us as a burden. ”Negrón Irizarry wants an alternative PPD candidate to stand next November. Garcia Padilla’s spokesman, Jesus Manuel Ortiz, said in a statement that the governor has “invested a great deal of time and energy into building productive relationships with Puerto Rico’s mayors,” and is in “constant communication with the island’s mayors”. The governor’s current fiscal turnaround proposal, which would cut $300 million in aid to municipalities by 2020, has increased tension in some of his mayoral relationships. Some have accused Garcia Padilla of failing to seek input from the towns. With business sparse and storefronts vacant in many of Puerto Rico’s rural communities, municipal governments are among the island’s largest employers. Carlos Delgado Altieri, the PPD mayor of Isabela, along the northwestern coast, says 40 percent of his town’s budget ,some $7 million ,comes from the central government to fund operations. Cuts could mean reduced hours for its 650 workers, and could jeopardize Isabela’s municipal bond payments, he said. Southeastern Patillas’ municipal government needs only 175 of the 450 employees it currently employs, PPD Mayor Norberto said. But with no viable private businesses to scoop up fired workers and unemployment already above 20 percent, he said he won’t consider layoffs. Garcia Padilla has faced internal revolts before. His plan to close a revenue gap by imposing a valueadded tax and raising the sales tax was resisted by a faction of his own party, who engineered an eventual reduction in the tax rate.

Ben Carson gives a speech at a 'Building the New Puerto Rico' event in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, November 8, 2015.  REUTERS/Alvin Baez . SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of  News Agency. Speaking at a convention for Puerto Rican gubernatorial candidate Ricardo Rossello, a member of the island’s prostatehood party, Carson said he “would be incredibly honored and delighted for Puerto Rico to be the 51st state. ”“One thing I’ve found when I have come to Puerto Rico is extremely friendly people,” the 64yearold retired neurosurgeon said, adding that “we have probably more patriotic Puerto Ricans than almost any other state. ”Statehood is a central political issue in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory whose two main parties are the prostatehood PNP and procommonwealth PPD, each of which have Democrats and Republicans within their ranks. The island’s fate has also made it onto U.S. presidential candidates’ agendas because Puerto Ricans can vote in presidential primaries ,though not general elections ,and because Florida, a key swing state, is home to nearly 1 million Puerto Ricans. Carson has found little support among Republicans in Puerto Rico, who mostly favor candidates Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, both of whom have endorsed statehood for the U.S. commonwealth. Carson called Puerto Rico “very strategically located for the defense of America, right near Cuba. ”“We have the Chinese already coming in and infiltrating the Caribbean,” he said. “We also have to recognize that we have global jihadists who are trying to destroy us. We need unity. ”Carson, neck and neck with Donald Trump atop Republican polls, spoke for about five minutes without addressing recent headlinegrabbing allegations that he misrepresented facts surrounding a scholarship offer to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and fabricated details of a violent exchange with a friend as a child. Those supporting statehood reason that inclusion for Puerto Rico in the U.S. would provide equal treatment on issues like federal Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, while those against are wary of risking the island’s independence and cultural identity. With Puerto Rico facing a $72 billion debt load and a roughly 45 percent poverty rate, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla of the procommonwealth Popular Democratic Party, faces historically low approval ratings and strong challenges in next year’s election from statehood candidates such as Rossello and Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi. Carson’s trip to Puerto Rico was seen as an effort to push himself onto the agenda there. A person close to Rossello’s campaign told  on Saturday that Carson was not invited by the campaign, but sought to be allowed to speak in the days leading up to the rally. Indeed, Rossello’s rally was an unexpected choice for Carson. Rossello is a Democrat, and his running mate, Puerto Rican House minority leader Jenniffer Gonzalez, is a Republican who supports Bush. Rossello, 36, has lit a fire in some voters with a zealous, energetic and youthful persona. He is the son of former Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Rossello, who governed in the 1990s during relatively prosperous times.

Control board best way to help Puerto Rico fiscal reform -official,Reuters Staff,10/26/15,"Puerto Rico’s top legal official urged the U.S. commonwealth’s legislature on Monday to adopt a bill proposing a control board to oversee the government’s finances, calling it the best way to show creditors a commitment to resolve its fiscal problems. Testifying at a joint hearing of Puerto Rico’s House Judiciary and Treasury Committees, Justice Secretary Cesar Miranda said the board, which is part of a broad economic turnaround plan by Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, would show the island was serious about fiscal responsibility. “This measure is necessary to communicate to constituents and our creditors that Puerto Rico is committed to maintaining responsible management of its finances,” Miranda said in written testimony ahead of his remarks, translated from Spanish. The board would “boost the economic development of the island while ensuring the wellbeing of the general citizenship,” and would not infringe on the island’s constitution or the powers of its legislature, he said. The board is part of a bill Garcia Padilla introduced earlier this month to turn around Puerto Rico’s economy, which is struggling to service $72 billion of debt. Miranda was part of a task force Garcia Padilla created in June to draft the proposal. The proposal also includes spending reforms and reduced payouts to bondholders. Many facets of the plan would need legislative approval, and the testimony on Monday addressed only the fiscal control board. Garcia Padilla will also introduce legislation this week to improve the finances at PREPA, Puerto Rico’s heavily indebted power utility, Jesus Manuel Ortiz, Puerto Rico’s government affairs secretary, said on Monday. PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority), with more than $8 billion in debt, is trying to hash out restructuring agreements with creditors, who have demanded reforms at the agency. Separately on Monday, the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico’s capital, struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to invest $180 million to upgrade its storm sewer systems. The settlement, subject to approval by a federal court in Puerto Rico, resolves litigation over San Juan’s discharges of raw sewage and other pollutants into the San Juan Bay Estuary, the Martin Pena Canal and other water bodies, the Justice Department said.

Puerto Rico faces humanitarian crisis without federal action: Treasury,Megan Davies,10/22/15,"U.S. Treasury Secretary counselor Antonio Weiss warned that Puerto Rico faces a humanitarian crisis without federal action, as he appealed to Congress to help the debtridden U.S. territory, in comments to a Senate committee hearing on Thursday. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory home to 3. 5 million, is buckling under $72 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate. With financial creditors resisting reductions to debt payments and political gridlock threatening proposed spending reforms, some Puerto Rican leaders have called on the U.S. government to step in. Weiss said that without action by Congress, Puerto Rico’s crisis would escalate and reiterated that the Obama administration’s policies were “not a bailout” for the island. He repeated the key points of a plan released by the Treasury on Wednesday, saying Congress should provide tools for Puerto Rico to restructure its liabilities, increase Medicaid support and boost economic growth through tax credits. A key element of Treasury’s proposal is its endorsement of extending bankruptcy protections not only to Puerto Rico’s public agencies, but to the island’s government itself ,a notion championed by some Puerto Rican leaders but seen as too radical to be politically practical. Cities, towns and municipal agencies can file for under the U.S. Chapter 9 bankruptcy code, while states cannot. Puerto Rico is exempt from Chapter 9 because it is a commonwealth. “Bankruptcy is not a bailout,” Weiss said, according to testimony released ahead of his remarks. “Allowing Puerto Rico to resolve its liabilities under the supervision of a bankruptcy court involves no federal financial assistance whatsoever. Instead, bankruptcy requires shared sacrifice from both Puerto Rico and its creditors. ”Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-treasury-idUSKCN0SG1TB20151022,Reuters,Neutral
New York Governor Cuomo pledges healthcare help to Puerto Rico,Nick Brown,9/8/15,"Puerto Rico, whose leaders have complained of unequal federal treatment on healthcare, may get some help from the state with the most Puerto Rican citizens outside the island itself ,New York. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo visited the U.S. commonwealth on Tuesday, presenting a plan to assist Puerto Rico in seeking federal investment to overhaul its healthcare system, and to pressure the U.S. government to change healthcare funding formulas. As Puerto Rico struggles under $72 billion in debt, its fate has become a talking point for many U.S. politicians, especially in New York and Florida, which have high Puerto Rican voting constituencies. Cuomo, who led a delegation of New York leaders to the Caribbean island, said in a Tuesday statement the trip was “about fighting to achieve fairness and parity for Puerto Rico,” whose 3. 5 million residents are ineligible for the federal health insurance exchange, even as insurers on the island pay $1. 85 million a year in Affordable Care Act taxes. Leaders in New York, home to more than 1 million Puerto Ricans, will pressure federal officials to change funding formulas and to replenish the island’s healthcare block grant, Cuomo said. New York Department of Health officials will help Puerto Rico form a plan to transform its healthcare delivery system, as New York did in 2011, as part of an application to the federal government for money to help with the overhaul, Cuomo added. Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who invited Cuomo to the island’s capital, San Juan, said in the statement, “The fiscal sustainability of Puerto Rico depends in no small part on Washington providing equitable healthcare treatment. ”Healthcare represents some 20 percent of a Puerto Rican economy saddled with $72 billion in debt. Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio visited Puerto Rico on Friday, with Clinton, a Democrat, addressing a healthcare panel and citing the “unfortunate legacy of inconsistent” and “inequitable treatment of healthcare” on the island. New York City Council Speaker Melissa MarkViverito, a Puerto Rican and a member of Cuomo’s delegation, said she believes the New York governor’s plan is politically attainable. In an interview on Tuesday, she cited the high Puerto Rican population in Florida, a key battleground state in next year’s presidential election. “If the president can make this a priority, if we can get this discussed in budgeting debates ,we just have to be united. ”",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-healthcare-idUSL1N11E28120150908,Reuters,Neutral
Factbox: Geographical changes for Puerto Rico's population,Reuters Staff,9/3/15,"Puerto Rico is getting attention from 2016 presidential hopefuls, who are making early stops in the U.S. territory, likely in part because of the fastgrowing number of Puerto Ricans living in the key battleground state of Florida. Here are some statistics about where Puerto Ricans live in the United States. * The number of Puerto Ricans among the U.S. states significantly outnumbers that on the island itself, according to Census data. In 2013, there were 5. 1 million Puerto Ricans in the states and the District of Columbia versus 3. 5 million living on the island. * The largest population of Puerto Ricans among the U.S. states is in New York, with 1. 1 million. Then comes Florida with 987,663; New Jersey with 478,439; Pennsylvania with 418,792, Massachusetts with 283,568; Connecticut with 269,607; California with 215,653; Illinois with 196,359, Texas with 157,011 and Ohio with 104,623. * The population of Puerto Ricans in swingstate Florida has doubled in little more than a decade, increasing from 482,027 in 2000, or 3 percent of the state’s population, to 987,663, or 5 percent in 2013, according to Census data. * The population of Puerto Ricans in battleground state Ohio has increased from 66,269 in 2000, or 0. 6 percent of the population, to 104,623 in 2013, or 0. 9 percent. * The increase in the number of Puerto Ricans of 342,423 in Florida since 2005 is almost neckandneck with the increase of 348,985 in the number of Cubans, the state’s largest Hispanic or Latino group with 1. 3 million people. * Census data from 20092013 showed the biggest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Florida is in Orange County, where around 160,000 people live and where the city of Orlando is located. * According to separate Census data, 6,256 people moved from the San JuanCarolinaCaguas metro area region in Puerto Rico to the OrlandoKissimmeeSanford, Florida metro area in the last year.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-puertorico-factbox-idUKKCN0R32HF20150903,Reuters,Neutral
FDIC ready to act on Puerto Rico banks if needed -letter,Megan Davies,8/21/15,"Puerto Rico’s FDICinsured banks are well capitalized but the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp stands ready to act if one should become insolvent, according to a letter sent to Congressman Sean Duffy, chairman of a Financial Services subcommittee who had inquired about their health. Puerto Rico’s Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla shocked investors in June when he said the island’s debt, totaling $72 billion, was unpayable and required restructuring. The island has been in recession for nearly a decade. “Our committee has jurisdiction over banks . . . and we have been working on the safety and soundness concerns of Puerto Rico banks,” said Duffy, who is separately working on a proposal to look for solutions to Puerto Rico’s problems with possible ideas including using a financial control board. Duffy requested in an Aug. 4 letter that the U.S. regulator detail how it was addressing potential issues among the island’s banks. The FDIC is “closely monitoring the fiscal and economic situation in Puerto Rico and assessing the potential impact on individual institutions,” said an Aug. 18 letter from FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg, provided by Duffy’s office. The FDIC confirmed its authenticity. Beginning in September 2013, the FDIC held regular discussions with the banks it supervises about their holdings of Puerto Rico debt and “observed a decline in the exposure over time. ”The five FDICinsured Puerto Rico banks ,Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Banco Santander Puerto Rico, FirstBank Puerto Rico, Oriental Bank and Scotiabank de Puerto Rico ,had $442 million exposure to Puerto Rico government securities in September 2013. That fell to $240 million as of June 30. The banks are well capitalized, the letter said, and the FDIC stands ready to “ensure the orderly, least costly resolution of failed insured depository institutions should one of them become insolvent. ”Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, also said he is working on broader ideas for a draft proposal to address solutions for Puerto Rico. Ideas could include a financial control board, an idea proposed in June by Republican Congressman Jeffrey Duncan, and Duffy is examining the possible impact of lifting the Jones shipping Act. The Jones Act requires ships carrying goods from one U.S. port to another to be built in the United States. He did not rule out supporting extending Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection for Puerto Rico entities, currently a Democratsupported proposal, but would like to see it part of wider reforms. “We have to come up with solutions that help the Puerto Rico people,” said Duffy. “It’s incumbent upon Republicans to engage on this issue. ” (Reporting by Megan Davies; Editing by Bernard Orr)Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-banks-idUSL1N10W1HJ20150821,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico seeks U.S. help as drought impact worsens,Jessica DiNapoli,8/12/15,"As the effects of a drought in Puerto Rico grow more severe, the commonwealth’s representative in Congress has called on the U.S. Department of Defense to provide assistance to the island. Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi in a letter dated Tuesday asked the department to create a task force to identify what it can do to replenish the island’s depleted reservoirs or to bring water directly to communities suffering most from the drought. “I want to make sure every possibility is explored given the worsening drought conditions and water rationing we are facing in Puerto Rico,” Pierluisi said in a prepared statement. The U.S. Drought Monitor reported that 20 percent of Puerto Rico’s total land area is currently experiencing “extreme” to “exceptionally extreme” drought, according to Pierluisi’s letter. In early May, the monitor said some of the island’s municipalities were under moderate drought, according to the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). Around this time, PRASA began rationing water in some parts of the island. The severe lack of rain is another blow to Puerto Rico as it struggles to restructure some $72 billion in debt. According to Pierluisi’s letter, the island’s Department of Education announced that because of water rationing, schools affected by the drought will operate only Monday through Thursday and with a shortened school day. Some school breakfasts are at risk of being canceled and lunches may be reduced or modified when the schools do not have water, he wrote. “A child should not have to go hungry or be denied a meal because of drought beyond their control,” Pierluisi said in a statement. Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture named several Puerto Rico municipalities as disaster areas, giving them access to emergency loans to make up for crop and livestock losses stemming from the drought.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-drought-idUSKCN0QH20X20150812,Reuters,Neutral
"Puerto Rico tourism industry lags rivals, offers little relief from debt crisis",Jessica DiNapoli,7/27/15,"Puerto Rico may sport palm trees, pristine beaches and glorious weather but its tourism industry is losing out to rival Caribbean islands ,and that is holding the U.S. territory back at a time when its deeply troubled economy most needs a fillip. A view of the empty swimming pool and the outside of the luxury Normandie Hotel, closed since 2008, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, July 18, 2015. Puerto Rico may sport palm trees, pristine beaches and glorious weather but its tourism industry is losing out to rival Caribbean islands ,and that is holding the U.S. territory back at a time when its deeply troubled economy most needs a fillip. REUTERS/Alvin BaezHoteliers blame a variety of issues for Puerto Rico lagging in both the growth of visitors and hotel rooms: mandatory staff perks, high construction and electricity costs, as well as plenty of red tape. And those problems may increase as the island’s government and the agencies it controls are struggling with a massive debt burden that could lead to default as early as this week. There is a danger that tax increases and other measures prompted by the crisis could drive hotel costs higher, even though the government supports tourism through tax breaks and credits. Rick Newman, who owns and operates the Verdanza Hotel in the popular beachside tourist strip of Isla Verde, says it is difficult to be competitive against rivals in the Caribbean, such as Cuba or the Dominican Republic, when labor costs in Puerto Rico are so much higher. “They pay the person for the week what it costs me for the day,” Newman said. The U.S. federal minimum wage of $7. 25 an hour applies to Puerto Rico, meaning that a worker doing a 40hour week will get about $290. Workers at allinclusive resorts in the Dominican Republic run by AMResorts are paid less than $60 a week, according to Gonzalo Del Peon, the company’s president. In communistruled Cuba, average weekly wages are a lot lower ,just $4 based on government documents provided by the United Nations ,though in reality the figure may be a bit higher and Cuban workers get a lot of government benefits. The number of tourists visiting Puerto Rico has barely budged from around 3. 2 million reported almost 20 years ago, while both the Dominican Republic and Cuba have seen demand surge ,more than doubling to 5. 1 million and more than tripling to 3 million a year, respectively. Cuban tourist arrivals were up another 15 percent in the first quarter of this year. Del Peon said AMResorts chose not to invest in Puerto Rico four to five years ago after seeing weak potential for returns on investment because of the high costs and middling room rates. The total cost to develop a room in Puerto Rico would run about 30 percent higher than the $200,000 to $250,000 AMResorts spends on average in other parts of the Caribbean, Del Peon said. And labor costs ,judging by the financials from a resort the company runs in another territory with the U.S. minimum wage, St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands ,can eat up 45 percent of revenue against 1820 percent elsewhere in the region. “The return on investment with additional operational costs is really challenging unless the market is willing to pay more,” he said. Employers are also obligated to pay workers in Puerto Rico perks such as mandatory Christmas bonuses up to a maximum of $600, while they are banned from asking them to work split shifts, important in hospitality when employees may only be needed during meal times, said labor attorney Radames Torruella of Puerto Ricobased McConnell Valdes. A report by former IMF economists released last month, which details the island’s fiscal and economic problems, identifies labor regulations as a major obstacle blocking economic development. “As of today, the tourism industry is estimated at around 6 percent of GDP,” said Mari Jo Laborde, chief marketing officer for the Puerto Rican Tourism Company, a governmentrun tourism promotion agency. “Our goal is to take that to at least 8 percent. ”Slideshow ( 5 images )By comparison, tourism contributes 27 percent of Jamaica’s GDP and 16 percent to the Dominican Republic, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. HOTEL ROOMS STATICIn the 1970s, Puerto Rico had about 9,000 hotel rooms, while Jamaica had about 6,600, and the Dominican Republic 1,600, according to a World Bank report. Today, the Dominican Republic has about 60,000 hotel rooms, and Jamaica has around 20,000, according to tourist board annual statistics, while Puerto Rico has only 15,000. Puerto Rico instead diversified its economy to focus on manufacturing, but that sector has struggled since U.S. federal tax incentives expired in 2006. The Puerto Rico Tourism Company is seeking to fight back with a plan to add 5,000 hotel rooms by 2020, Laborde said. Officials also say that a marketing campaign launched in late 2013 ,based on the description of Puerto Rico as “The AllStar Island” ,showed some signs of success with an increase in tourism spending recorded since then. Puerto Rico’s luxury hospitality sector has also recently attracted some investment. Newman is building a new Four Seasons resort, and a RitzCarlton Reserve opened recently. Hedge fund manager John Paulson has also been investing in opulent hotels. And one bright spot in tourism development has been Puerto Rico’s pursuit of cruise ship visitors. Their numbers have been rising, reaching 1. 5 million in the last fiscal year, up from 1. 2 million in the previous year, said Ingrid Rivera Rocafort, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. While they aren’t as lucrative for the island as holiday makers who stay in a hotel, Rivera Rocafort says that once they get a taste for Puerto Rico they do return. Still, it isn’t only more costefficient competition from the Caribbean that Puerto Rico has to worry about. Electricity rates in Puerto Rico are among the highest in the U.S. , putting the island at a disadvantage to a place like Florida, where they are much lower. That is largely because the governmentcontrolled Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is reliant on imported oil. When oil spikes, “you basically operate in negative numbers,” the hotel owner and operator Newman said, forcing him to cut costs, including staff, whose ranks have fallen to about 130 from 165 in the past fivetosix years. To be sure, as the oil price has plunged in the past year, Newman has enjoyed a partial reprieve from punishing electricity bills, and he is using the extra cash to make upgrades at the Verdanza. But he still faces other high charges – his water bill has climbed to about $20,000 a month. And while utility charges can also be high on other islands in the Caribbean, higher room rates elsewhere often compensate. In Puerto Rico, the average hotel room could be booked for $188. 53 per night last year, while rooms in Aruba and Jamaica were $90 and $20 more, according to STR, a hotel research company. The potential lift of the ban on most U.S. domestic travel to Cuba could hurt American tourism in Puerto Rico, which is currently the source for about 90 percent of visitors. The Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association expects Americans will flood into Cuba, possibly bypassing the U.S. territory. AMResorts does not see enough happening to create attractive opportunities in Puerto Rico, Del Peon said. Without more investment in marketing and hotel improvements, “it becomes this vicious cycle,” he said.

U.S. shippers push back in battle over Puerto Rico import costs,Rory Carroll,7/9/15,"Tensions over a 95yearold shipping law have reignited after Puerto Rico’s governor said it has contributed to the island’s dire fiscal situation, a charge met with fierce resistance from the U.S. shipping industry but support from some oil companies and economists. Puerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla delivers his state of the Commonwealth address at the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico April 30, 2015.  REUTERS/Alvin BaezIn a speech on June 29 outlining Puerto Rico’s $72 billion debt burden, Governor Garcia Padilla called for the island to be exempted from the Jones Act, which requires ships carrying goods from one U.S. port to another to be built in the United States, have U.S. owners and be mostly staffed by U.S. crews. Because it is an island, Puerto Rico relies heavily on ships to bring goods from the U.S. mainland to its ports. A 2012 report by two University of Puerto Rico economists concluded that the policy translated into a $537 million hit to the island’s economy in 2010, and recommended the statute be phased out. Discussion of the Jones Act comes after Padilla shocked bondholders last week by saying he wants to restructure the huge debt and postpone bond payments, after a nearly decadelong recession characterized by high unemployment. What part the Jones Act has played in leading to Puerto Rico’s current fiscal crisis is hotly debated. Shipping companies say the island has benefited from years of reliable service. Critics say it has unfairly raised prices to the detriment of Puerto Rican businesses and people. “It is unfortunate that the Jones Act is being used as one excuse for the financial crisis, which was brought about by too much publicsector borrowing and spending,” said Mark Miller, an official with Crowley Maritime Corp, a major shipping company servicing Puerto Rico. (Graphic on Puerto Rico's Jones Act effect link. reuters. com/kef25w)Crowley, along with Trailer Bridge Inc, Sea Star Line LLC and National Shipping of America, is responsible for most of the shipments from U.S. states to Puerto Rico. Trailer Bridge, Sea Star Line, and National Shipping of America did not respond to a request for comment. The American Maritime Partnership (AMP), the powerful lobby group for the U.S. shipping industry, attacked a separate report released on June 29 by former IMF economists, which was requested by Padilla’s administration and which found that the Jones Act was hurting Puerto Rico’s economy. The report found that the price of imports from U.S. states was at least double that in neighboring islands like the U.S. Virgin Island, which is not covered by the act. Progrowth reforms like a cut in transportation costs through a Jones Act waiver are needed to restore competitiveness and help Puerto Rico out of its financial pit, the report said. U.S. shipping interests disagree. “The statements about the Jones Act in the (former IMF economists’) report are overly simplistic, completely onesided, and just plain wrong,” said Mark Ruge, counsel to AMP. He pointed to a 2013 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) which said there are too many factors at play to estimate the economic impact of the Jones Act on prices in Puerto Rico. While shippers doing business in Puerto Rico reported that freight rates are often, but not always, lower for foreign carriers, the GAO said it was unclear what impact modifying the Jones Act would have on the economy. LONG SHOTPuerto Rico is unlikely to win an exemption, which are usually only granted by the Department of Homeland Security during national emergencies, like Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, when fuel and other supplies are desperately needed. An exemption could have a substantial impact on the U.S. territory, which in 2013 imported $45 billion and exported $62 billion in goods, according to the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico. Opponents of the act have some powerful allies, including oil companies, which argue that there aren’t enough U.S. built ships available, leading to expensive bottlenecks. “It’s inefficient and it distorts the market,” said David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a transportation energy consulting company. “It makes life more expensive for people living on islands like Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii and those in Alaska. ”Hackett notes that the U.S. East Coast imports 500,000 barrels of gasoline a day from overseas while the Gulf Coast exports nearly that same amount to foreign buyers. A primary reason the Gulf Coast does not simply send its gasoline to the East Coast is because of the Jones Act, which makes it prohibitively expensive to move the freight. Another prominent Jones Act opponent is Sen. John McCain, who has offered legislation on the topic in the past that failed to gain traction. He has called AMP “as powerful as anybody or any organization I have run up against in my political career. ”The Jones Act was first adopted in 1920 to ensure that U.S. merchant marine ships remained capable of serving military needs in the event of war or national emergency and to ensure a strong domestic maritime industry. AMP still touts the act as critical to national security and says that without it, the United States would be dependent on foreignowned and flagged vessels, leaving it shorthanded in the event of a crisis. U.S. presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama have endorsed it as important to national security. Jones Act supporters say it promotes jobs in domestic shipbuilding. It has wide support in Congress because workers in all 50 U.S. states make components for the vessels. Congress reaffirmed its support for the Jones Act last year when it passed overwhelmingly as part of the Defense Authorization Act. Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner in the U.S. Congress, introduced a bill in July 2013 for the U.S. territory to receive an exemption from the Jones Act, but he is skeptical of its chances. “To say this legislation faces political headwinds in Washington is a serious understatement,” he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-shipping-idUSKCN0PJ2TF20150709,Reuters,Neutral
S&P downgrades Puerto Rico debt to 'CCC+' from 'B',Reuters Staff,4/24/15,"Standard & Poor’s said on Friday it had downgraded Puerto Rico’s general obligation debt even further into junk territory, from a B rating down to a CCC plus grade. The grading means the ratings agency now grades the U.S. commonwealth’s debt rating four notches above the lowest possible grade of “default. ”In February S&P downgraded Puerto Rico’s general obligation debt by three notches, where its debt rating was already headed into junk territory. The latest downgrade was based on the view that the U.S. commonwealth’s access to markets has further weakened, and that political problems, particularly a lack of consensus on elements of the 2016 budget, could further worsen fiscal pressure on the territory. “We base our downgrade. . . on our view that the commonwealth’s market access prospects have further weakened and Puerto Rico’s ability to meet its financial commitments is increasingly tied to the business, financial and economic conditions on the island. Absent improvement in those conditions, we believe debt and other financial commitments will be unsustainable,” S&P said in a statement.

Puerto Rico woos the rich but so far gains little,Edward Krudy,4/17/15,"Hedge fund manager Robb Rill grins. He has just had word that U.S. financial regulators have finally closed Puerto Rico’s ailing lender Doral Financial, a stock he has been shorting for the past six months. Pedestrians stand outside a branch of the Doral Bank in San Juan February 27, 2015. REUTERS/Alvin BaezHernandez“Doral is no more,” he tells staff in his office, its marble desk tops, dark wood furniture and leather chairs more reminiscent of a New England country club than a Puerto Rico beach town. Rill is one of a cohort of money managers from the mainland who moved to the U.S. territory lured by tax breaks introduced in 2011 to boost the flagging economy and betting against a troubled local bank may not be what the authorities had in mind. To be sure, Rill’s fund played no part in the lender’s downfall and its business plan focuses on investing in tech and financial firms. But the Doral transactions serve to symbolize Puerto Rico’s challenge of ensuring that the tax breaks spur enough economic activity to reverse years of decline. Almost four years on, the economic payoffs still appear elusive. The government says nearly 900 individuals and firms have moved under the tax relief program, creating 7,000 jobs. So far, however, economic data and those with a front row view of the territory’s economy ,real estate brokers, investors and lawyers dealing with crossborder transactions ,have yet to register a significant upswing. “We are starting to see some activity ,not huge, it’s very slow,” says Fernando Toro, a real estate agent at Cushman and Wakefield in San Juan, about interest in rental office space. Mark Leeds, tax partner with international law firm Mayer Brown, says interest in the tax breaks only picked up last year. “I have not seen a rush toward this,” he said. “For whatever reason it doesn’t seem to be for everybody. ”SMALL DOLLARSStrict residency conditions, which include spending half of the year on the island and selling or leasing home on the mainland, discourage some individuals. The precarious state of government finances and fears that tax rules could change again, seem to keep bigger firms sidelined, lawyers and brokers say. “What we’re talking about right now is very small dollars and a very nominal piece of the overall GDP of the island,”Todd Hagerman, a spokesman for the Government Development Bank in Puerto Rico says. The government expects each new company to create 30 jobs on average, but Hagerman says most firms that have moved are small businesses, with the exception of call centers that employ hundreds and flatter the overall jobs count. However, he voices optimism that the tax program would gain momentum, echoing its chief architect Alberto Baco, who says the number of new jobs it brings will double this year and 82,500 more will be added to the $100 billion economy over the next five years. Yet so far the island, which has been in an out of recession for the past nine years, lost 36,000 jobs since 2011. Between 2010 and 2013 twice as many Puerto Ricans left for the mainland than in two decades to 2000. The tax program that covers financial services firms, other companies that export services and wealthy individuals offers a flat 4 percent corporate income tax, and exemption from capital gains tax and certain interest and dividends taxes. The territory counts prominent hedge fund manager John Paulson among its investors and supporters, although he has not taken up tax residency there or moved his firm to the island. Paulson, who redeveloped San Juan’s fivestar Vanderbilt hotel is investing in commercial real estate and called Puerto Rico the “Singapore of the Caribbean. ”But Paulson, who manages $19. 3 billion in assets, is hardly representative for 509 individuals and 346 firms that have taken advantage of the tax incentives through the end of 2014. Most of the hedge funds and traders on the island appear to be relatively small outfits trading in public markets, such as Rill’s sub$100 million fund. Based in Dorado, a resort town outside San Juan, the fund has a local staff of eight, which is already a significant contribution to the local economy, Rill says. “We are picking up people in the professional class that are outstanding that otherwise simply wouldn’t have any opportunity,” Rill says. Rill says his firm is looking at launching a fund focused on local investments after Puerto Rico last year introduced tax breaks for private equity investments on the island. A $4. 7 million KPMG study that Puerto Rico commissioned to guide its tax overhaul criticized the tax breaks as “inordinately complex” and suggested scrapping the incentives for individuals and linking corporate ones to economic activity. Nick Prouty, a Puerto Ricobased real estate investor with $500 million worth of projects on the island, says it badly needs more capital, but it is equally important how that capital will be put to work. “Will these people make investments in Puerto Rico or will they sit in Dorado and trade?”(This story corrects names in penultimate and first paragraphs)",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-feature-idINKBN0N80C520150417,Reuters,Neutral
Chapter 9 a 'Wild West' solution for Puerto Rico agencies: adviser,Reuters Staff,2/25/15,"A proposed bill to give Puerto Rico’s ailing public agencies a way to restructure debts under U.S. bankruptcy law is a “Wild West” solution that would likely hurt bondholders, an adviser for major investors argued in written testimony ahead of a key congressional committee. The bill to give Puerto Rico’s agencies the ability to file under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code ,used by cities such as Detroit, Michigan, and Stockton, California ,was proposed by the U.S. territory’s representative to Congress, Democrat Pedro Pierluisi. It will be heard on Thursday. “Use of Chapter 9 by any of Puerto Rico’s public corporations will cause more harm than good, for both millions of Americans who invested in Puerto Rico bonds and for the Commonwealth,” according to testimony from Thomas Mayer, a partner at Kramer Levin. Mayer represents funds managed by Franklin Municipal Bond Group and OppenheimerFunds Inc in respect to their investment in $1. 6 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico’s electric utility, PREPA. PREPA is in dire shape, laden with about $9 billion in debt and already deep in restructuring negotiations with bondholders. Using Chapter 9 would force bondholders to shoulder the burden of PREPA’s operational failures and Puerto Rico’s fiscal irresponsibility, Mayer said. “Chapter 9 is the Wild West,” Mayer’s testimony said. “The only certainty is that Chapter 9 takes a long time ,at least 18 months to three years ,and is very expensive. ”Pierluisi has argued that the bill empowers the Puerto Rico government to authorize its insolvent public corporations to use a “triedandtrue legal procedure” and would be in the best interests of all stakeholders, including creditors. Discussion about the bill was reignited when a federal court on Feb. 6 struck down a local law enacted by the Caribbean island granting agencies similar debtrestructuring authority. Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank, which finances many of the territory’s official functions, said Chapter 9 would be a “useful tool for Puerto Rico’s longterm economic success, whether or not it is actually invoked,” according to testimony from GDB President Melba Acosta. Acosta said Chapter 9 provides a legal regime already understood by the markets, creditors, prospective lenders and suppliers.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-restructuring-idUSKBN0LT2N620150225,Reuters,Neutral
UPDATE 1-Puerto Rico lawmakers remove interest cap from $2 bln bond deal,Reuters Staff,2/10/15,"Puerto Rico’s lawmakers have scrapped a statutory cap on the interest the island would pay on a roughly $2 billion bond deal in a bid to make it more appealing to hedge fund investors. The move comes after a federal judge voided a local law that was key to Puerto Rico’s efforts to carry out an orderly restructuring of its public corporations while securing funds for the central government. The judge’s ruling late on Friday that the Recovery Act contravenes federal law, raised questions about the strength of governmentbacked debt, sending benchmark Puerto Rico’s bonds to record lows on Monday. AdvertisementEliminating the interest rate cap was “necessary to make viable a successful transaction in the capital markets because of current market conditions and the current value of Puerto Rico general obligation bonds,” according to the legislation approved by the Senate. The amendment eliminated a restriction on how large a discount Puerto Rico could offer buyers that would have established a floor of 93 cents on the dollar, but they kept a provision that limits the average coupon rate to 8. 5 percent. The elimination of the discount restriction removes what would have been a roughly 9. 2 percent cap on the yield even though the debt is trading with yields at over 10 percent. Puerto Rico’s House approved the measure on Tuesday after the Senate backed it late the previous day. Puerto Rico was planning to issue the bonds last year but delayed the sale due to disputes about raising a tax on oil needed to back them. Puerto Rico issued $3. 5 billion of debt last March that was largely bought by hedge funds as riskaverse municipal bond investors stayed away. The island’s Government Development Bank (GDB) wanted to work around the interest rate cap by insuring $500 million of the deal, which would have helped lower the average coupon rate. But given the slow pace of negotiations with bond insurers, officials are looking at alternatives. “We are studying other options, but the best option is to amend the legislation. It’s a completely different market from last year,” said Melba Acosta, president of the GDB, which acts as Puerto Rico’s financing arm. The GDB also wants lawmakers to index a hike in the petroleum tax to inflation, allowing them to increase the size of the deal to $2. 95 billion. The petroleum tax is being used to back the debt. “Without the (inflation) escalator this is just a patch for the GDB,” said one New York based hedge fund investor who may participate in the deal and had been at the legislature all day meeting with lawmakers.

"FBI raids Puerto Rico highways authority, arrests treasurer",Reuters Staff,12/3/14,"The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Puerto Rico’s Highways and Transportation Authority (HTA) on Wednesday, taking documents and arresting the organization’s treasurer for alleged bribery in programs using federal funds. The treasurer, Silvino Cepeda Ortiz, was arrested at his place of work “without incident” in connection with a briberyforpayment scheme involving three unnamed HTA contractors, the U.S. Attorney’s office saidThe raid was the second against one of Puerto Rico’s indebted public corporations in little over a week. On Nov. 25, the FBI seized documents and computer equipment at the offices of the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (ASA). No arrests were made. The recent enforcement activity raises questions over governance at the corporations that have accumulated over $20 billion in debt. It also comes as the commonwealth tries to raise up to $2. 9 billion to repay $2. 2 billion that HTA owes the Government Development Bank (GDB), the financing arm of Puerto Rico’s government. HTA’s Executive Director Javier Ramos Hernandez said the HTA has suspended Cepeda Ortiz. “We won’t tolerate actions that go against the public wellbeing,” Ramos Hernandez said. Cepeda Ortiz could not be reached for comment and did not respond to a message sent to his Facebook page. An FBI spokesman in Puerto Rico, Moises Quinones, told local radio station Noti Uno that the FBI had placed a person in custody after the raid on HTA. During a meeting with a company official in September, Cepeda Ortiz allegedly requested a bribe of $10,000 for making funds available to pay an invoice of $1. 98 million to a second company, the U.S. Attorney’s office said. During a meeting on Dec. 1 with company officials he received $5,000 in cash and agreed to receive the third payment on Wednesday. The payment was made directly before Cepeda Ortiz was arrested, the U.S. Attorney’s office said. Puerto Rico’s economy is floundering and it has over $70 billion in debt. At least one public corporation, the electric authority PREPA, is expected to default on over $9 billion. The HTA has over $7 billion in debt and can default under a controversial law passed earlier this year. Puerto Rico’s Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla referred to the “irresponsibility” of loans made to the HTA in a speech on Sunday night. Last week the governor threatened to shut down the island’s transport system ,including the HTA ,because of a dispute over increasing a tax needed to help fix HTA’s finances. “We are now confronting the consequences of the irresponsibility of these loans that were taken, situations so serious that it threatens to shut the operations of the HTA and important public works projects,” the governor said. HTA Bonds traded sharply lower on Wednesday. Bonds maturing in 2015 and carrying a 4 percent coupon traded with an average price of 88. 175 cents on the dollar, down from 94. 998 when the bonds last traded on Nov. 21.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-prhta-idUSKCN0JH27E20141203,Reuters,Neutral

UBS to pay $5.2 mln in settlement with Puerto Rico regulator,Suzanne Barlyn,10/14/14,"A UBS AG unit will pay $5. 2 million in a settlement with Puerto Rico’s financial institutions regulator over the firm’s practices involving sales of Puerto Rico closedend bond funds whose values later plunged. UBS Financial Services Inc of Puerto Rico has agreed to pay $1. 7 million in restitution to 34 Puerto Rico residents who invested in the funds and an additional $3. 5 million to an investor education fund, according to a statement from Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions on Oct. 9. The firm will also have to beef up its supervision of six brokers who Puerto Rico financial regulators found may have directed their clients to improperly borrow money in order to buy the funds, according to the settlement between UBS and Puerto Rico financial regulators, also on Oct. 9. The loans, sold through UBS Bank USA of Utah, were not supposed to be used to buy securities. The UBS brokers, who were not identified in the settlement, may have recommended and traded positions in the closedend funds that were too large, given the clients’ liquid assets, risk tolerance and “more modest financial profile,” according to the settlement. UBS did not admit to any wrongdoing, negligence or mismanagement under the terms of the deal. A UBS spokesman said the firm is pleased to have resolved the matter with Puerto Rico’s financial institutions regulator and looks forward to serving clients there. Legal headaches have been mounting for UBS following a sharp decline in the value of Puerto Rico municipal bonds last year that resulted in big losses for investors in closedend funds with heavy exposure to those bonds. The losses have sparked lawsuits and more than 500 securities arbitration cases against the firm. U.S. authorities launched a criminal fraud investigation in June over possible lending rule violations. The Oct. 9 settlement stems from a “routine examination” that Puerto Rico financial regulators launched last year, covering the UBS unit’s activity from June 2010 to September 2013. Regulators developed their findings based partly on interviews with a sampling of UBS clients who were elderly with low net worth and conservative investment goals. UBS must increase its supervision of the six brokers involved for six months. Regulators did not identify the brokers in the settlement because it does not plan to take action against them and UBS did not admit to wrongdoing, Rafael Blanco, Puerto Rico’s commissioner of financial institutions, said in an interview on Tuesday. Rafael’s office had initially identified nine brokers, but three have since left UBS, he said.

"Desperate for taxes, Puerto Rico tries to get grip on underground economy",Luciana Lopez,4/9/14,"Mattress maker Angel Lopez is both a problem and an opportunity for the Puerto Rican government. Mattress repairman and fruit vendor Angelo Lopez holds a coconut and a sugarapple in the shed which he calls his factory in Lares, western Puerto Rico April 7, 2014. REUTERS/Ana MartinezHis oneman business works off the books as part of a vast underground economy, which doesn’t directly pay into the treasury’s coffers and is a major headache for an impoverished island that is $70 billion in debt. But Lopez has dreams the island’s leadership is eager to foster. He wants to open a small factory, hire a few people and register with the town of Lares ,as long as the taxes and fees from going above board don’t choke off his business. The Lopez dilemma is playing out across Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean. From the western mountain town of Lares to the capital San Juan, officials are wrestling with how to bring the underground economy out of the shadows and onto the tax rolls without creating such an onerous financial burden that thousands of small and medium businesses can’t survive. More than a quarter of the island’s economy is informal, some studies say, from large companies evading taxes to individuals selling items for cash at roadside stands. But estimates vary widely because the activity can be so hard to track. While not new, the problem has become urgent of late. The government desperately needs to find new revenue to bolster a budget full of holes and turn around an economy now eight years in recession. It is scrambling to avoid a painful debt restructuring some view as almost inevitable. Last month’s $3. 5 billion bond sale bought the island some time, but precious little else, with fundamental worries about its shrinking economy still unsolved. “The government here, they want you to pay here, pay City Hall, pay the Hacienda,” said Lopez, referring to the local name for the island’s Treasury department. The divisions between the government and its people leave policymakers in a damnedifyoudo, damnedifyoudon’t position. “This is the conundrum for the island,” said Emily Raimes, lead analyst on Puerto Rico for Moody’s Investors Service. “Actions that they can take to help their finances may very well be actions that hurt the economy. ”The Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury knows it needs to jumpstart both growth and revenue, said Melba Acosta, the island’s treasury secretary. But how to do both is a balancing act for policymakers. “It’s the responsibility of the government to make sure that somebody who wants to establish a business doesn’t feel that it’s too burdensome to do so in a legal way,” she told . Still, many entrepreneurs feel the costs of being legal are too big a burden, especially when conducting some or all of their business off the grid is a relative breeze. In fact, calling it the “underground economy” is a bit misleading when so much of it operates in plain sight. Puerto Rico has its share of outright illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, but the vast majority of the $15 billion a year or more of informal commerce is simply activity that would be taxable if the government cracked down on it. That covers everything from people such as Lopez, who also sells fruit to tourists, to retail chains that don’t send the sales taxes they collect to the government. RINGING UP SALES, BUT NOT TAXESAnd it’s not limited to traditional cash businesses like the retail trade. Even some professionals will accept cash only, a practice that makes it easy to hide revenue from tax collectors. Slideshow ( 6 images )In upscale Condado, a beachfront neighborhood in the capital San Juan, for instance, it is common to see doctors’ offices with signs declaring cash as the only form of payment. By its nature, it is difficult to measure the informal economy’s size with tremendous accuracy. Jose Villamil, a local economist and head of consultancy Estudios Tecnicos, pegs it at about 27 or 28 percent of the formal economy of about $70 billion, as measured by its 2012 gross national product, although “that’s probably underestimated. ”Indeed, some estimates peg it closer to a third of the island economy. By contrast, the informal economy in the continental United States is estimated to account for about 19 percent of all activity, according to Prof. Richard Cebula of Jacksonville University. In 2006 the government instituted a sales tax in a bid to capture some of those informal dollars. Everybody spends, the thinking went, even people who are paid off the books and never declare their income. They still buy clothes, food, gasoline, and eat at restaurants. But local economist Gustavo Vélez says the government only gets about 56 cents of every dollar it’s due from that tax, known as IVU in its Spanish acronym, based on his analysis of the tax capture rate. The government disputes that number but acknowledges that stores from big to little evade the tax. Earlier this year the owners of two local stores were charged with tax evasion for collecting more than $1 million of tax since 2009 but not forwarding it to the Treasury, according to the government. In other cases, shops simply do not collect the tax at all, keeping all their sales off the books entirely. If Puerto Rico got the IVU capture rate up to 75 percent, the government could see another $391 million a year, Vélez said, based on a total IVU intake of about $1. 2 billion last year. JUNK RATINGS SPARK FEARSPuerto Rico certainly does need the money. All three major credit rating agencies slashed the island’s public debt to junk status earlier this year, a move that will make borrowing more expensive. Many residents, especially the young and educated, have fled for the U.S. mainland, leaving behind an aging population with an overall poverty rate of nearly 45 percent. The island’s unemployment rate is 15 percent. The administration of Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, in office since early last year, has scrambled to get the economy humming and finances under control. Padilla has raised taxes, pledged to end years of operating deficits and overhauled retirement programs, despite union protests. “Everything that we’ve been passing through the legislature has been hitting directly the underground economy,” said Rep. Rafael “Tatito” Hernández Montañez, who has recently sponsored bills to make it easier for the government to track businesses and figure out who is and isn’t paying the required fees. The government is also pushing to enforce the laws already on its books. The Treasury is hiring about 200 more tax specialists. Some of those will be checking on the books of businesses across the island, but some will be mystery shopping ,making purchases at specially selected stores without identifying themselves to check for violators. Sales tax evaders could get slapped with a maximum $20,000 fine. But $20,000 for a small business could mean a hefty chunk of revenues. That means a delicate balance for the government: Changing attitudes so that more businesses register and pay their taxes and fees, while not piling so many bills onto small businesses that they collapse. That is why the government is building exemptions into some laws for small businesses, said Rep. Montañez. It is simply fairer for everyone, he said. For now, “the people who pay taxes pay double, because they pay for themselves and for those who don’t pay. ”A fifth of the sample in a 2008 study from the Center for a New Economy, a Puerto Rican think tank, did some informal work, even if they had a regular job. Even Angel Lopez, with his dream of a small mattress factory, is not sure just how above board he’s prepared to be. If he brings his dream to fruition, he might enter his business onto the rolls as a mattress repair shop instead of a production facility making foam mattresses from scratch. That way he says he won’t have to pay as much to the government.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-economy-insight-idUSBREA380BS20140409,Reuters,Neutral
Redemptions force U.S. mutual funds to unload Puerto Rico debt,Tim McLaughlin,2/7/14,"U.S. mutual funds with heavy exposure to Puerto Rico bonds have sold off some of the cashstrapped island’s debt to meet investor redemption demands, taking heavy losses after a yearlong slide in prices. The sellers included some of Puerto Rico’s most bullish U.S. mutual fund investors. Some of the funds run by OppenheimerFunds, a vocal supporter of the territory’s recent financial improvements, have sold Puerto Rico debt, according to analysts and public filings. But Oppenheimer’s Rochester funds combined have been net buyers of Puerto Rico bonds over the past few months as its research continues to show that Puerto Rico will honor its debt obligations in full, company spokeswoman Kaitlyn Downing said. Funds with less exposure aren’t likely to unload their Puerto Rico debt at fire sale prices, said Daniel Hanson, an analyst at Height Securities LLC. They can afford to hold tight and ride out the storm. Still, mutual funds have found willing buyers in more riskprone hedge funds, such as Meehan Combs LP and Maglan Capital. Distressed debt funds run by Marathon Asset Management LP and Stone Lion Capital Partners LP also have shown interest in Puerto Rico’s bonds, analysts said. Puerto Rico and its agencies have about $70 billion in debt outstanding, and much of it is held by U.S. mutual funds. Its bonds are appealing because they are taxexempt in every U.S. state, and the yields offer high returns to investors willing to stomach the uncertainty. A darkening outlook for Puerto Rico’s finances has made investors nervous about a potential default. Standard & Poors cut Puerto Rico’s credit rating to junk status on Tuesday, and Fitch warned in November it could do the same. Before the S&P’s move, mutual funds run by Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc disclosed this past week they had eliminated what they described as small positions in the territory late last year, regulatory filings show. The top 10 U.S. mutual funds with the greatest exposure to Puerto Rico have been hit with nearly $3 billion in net outflows over the past year, according to Morningstar Inc. data, amounting to about a quarter of the funds’ combined net assets. The $363 million Franklin DoubleTax Free Income Fund, which has about 60 percent of its holdings in Puerto Rico debt, recently sold nearly $64 million worth of bonds, according to data from Thomson ’ Lipper service. At least half of those sales included Puerto Rico bonds as the fund has experienced $277 million in outflows in the past year, according to Morningstar and Lipper data. The Franklin fund, run by Franklin Resources Inc, is grappling with a mandate geared toward investing at least 80 percent of its assets in taxfree bonds issued by U.S. territories. “Given that Puerto Rico issues the vast majority of bonds among these territories, Puerto Rico currently represents the majority of the fund’s investments,” Franklin spokeswoman Stacey Johnston Coleman said. Municipal Market Advisors Inc. , an independent municipal bond research firm, said in a note to clients that Puerto Rico’s downgrade could reignite the sort of heavy investor outflows witnessed last year when the S&P Municipal Bond Puerto Rico Index fell nearly 21 percent. “Funds may need to turn to selling things like tobacco (bonds) in the near term to raise cash, further exacerbating the market condition,” MMA said. Funds meet redemptions typically by selling portfolio assets or by borrowing from a bank credit line. Sometimes they are forced to unload assets they would prefer not to sell. OppenheimerFunds, a unit of insurer MassMutual Financial Group, has nine funds of the top 10 funds with the greatest exposure to Puerto Rico, according to Morningstar. The funds also have been the most bullish about Puerto Rico, saying that negative headlines in the press don’t take into account the island’s many financial improvements. OppenheimerFunds’ Puerto Rico holdings total about $5. 1 billion, a decline of about 15 percent, or $900 million, over the past year, according to fund disclosures. The $6. 2 billion Oppenheimer Rochester Municipals Mutual Fund, for example, sold $51 million worth of a Puerto Rico sales tax revenue bond that matures in 2054, according to Lipper data for the fourth quarter. The fund’s net outflows over the past year have totaled $1. 2 billion.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-puertorico-bonds-idUSBREA161E420140208,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico warns about dwindling numbers of frogs,DANICA COTO,12/12/13,"Three species of frogs native to the mountains of Puerto Rico have apparently disappeared from several critical habitats, a sign that a long decline in amphibians on the island shows no signs of letting up. Scientists on Thursday blamed the decline on climate change, habitat destruction and a fungus known as “bd” or Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has killed dozens of amphibian species worldwide. The species most at risk in Puerto Rico is the mountain coqui, which is now found only in portions of El Yunque forest and another forest in the island’s southern region, said Rafael Joglar, a herpetologist at the University of Puerto Rico. “This species has basically retreated to the highest and coldest mountains of Puerto Rico,” he said. “The problem is that it has nowhere higher to go.” It is one of the island’s 17 endemic coqui species, which have long been a popular symbol of the U.S. territory. The mountain coqui once lived in the western part of the island and across its central mountain range, but numbers there have since dwindled, and in some cases disappeared, said Jan Zegarra, a Puerto Rico-based biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “People love the coquis of Puerto Rico, but they don’t realize what’s going on,” Joglar said. “We don’t need more investigations to protect this species. There is enough evidence to warrant protection.” While the coqui is originally from Puerto Rico, it has been found in Costa Rica and has formed large colonies in Hawaii, where it has no natural predators. Joglar previously rejected the idea of breeding frogs in captivity to ensure their survival in Puerto Rico, noting they have died when introduced into the wild as adults, but he said that may be the only alternative now. Scientists are using breeding programs in an attempt to save another one of the island’s endangered species, the Puerto Rican crested toad.

Puerto Rico approves public pension system overhaul,Reuters Staff,4/5/13,"Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has signed an overhaul of the U.S. territory’s cashshort public pension fund into law, after it was passed by lawmakers late on Thursday in a bid to soothe investors and shore up the country’s sputtering economy. “This has not been a simple process,” Garcia Padilla said as he enacted the legislation on Thursday night that had been bitterly opposed by labor unions. “It has been a topic that has been avoided for the past 60 years. No administration has taken the responsibility of reforming the retirement system,” the governor said. Officials said the overhaul, of the notoriously weak and underfunded public pension system, was a crucial step to avoid a potentially devastating credit downgrade. “No retirement system in the world is as broken as ours,” Senate President Eduardo Bhatia said on Thursday, before the overhaul legislation was approved by both houses of the Caribbean island’s legislature. All three major credit ratings firms have recently downgraded Puerto Rico’s bond ratings to just above junkbond status, pointing to widening budget deficits as the island struggles to emerge from a fiveyear recession that has pushed unemployment to nearly 15 percent. The Caribbean island is a leading borrower in the $3. 7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market. Any further downgrade by rating agencies would sharply increase the cost of borrowing for Puerto Rico, which needs to be able to issue bonds at attractive rates to meet pressing shortterm financing needs. The new pension law will raise the retirement age for some state workers, increase worker pensions contributions and lower monthly pensions and benefits for some public workers. It will also reduce state workers’ Christmas bonuses and eliminate summer bonus payments. Although the municipal bond market could show some positive reaction to the pension reform news, Puerto Rico’s yields were already the highest of any borrower in the U.S. municipal bond market. On Thursday, Puerto Rico’s 10year yield spread over triple A bonds ended at a fouryear high of 310 basis points, unchanged from Wednesday, Municipal Market Data showed. The 10year Puerto Rico yield spread hit a record high at 340 basis points in February 2009 during the financial crisis. The government’s main retirement fund faces an unfunded liability of more than $37 billion. The fund, which serves more than 200,000 current and retired government workers, is only about 7 percent funded and officials have warned it could run out of money by 2018. To help narrow the budget deficit, top Puerto Rico government officials say they are evaluating tax increases and other measures to increase annual revenue by more than $1 billion. Tax noncompliance is one of the problems that have prompted comparisons between Puerto Rico and Greece, however.

Jury declines to impose death penalty in Puerto Rico murders,Reuters Staff,3/23/13,"A man convicted of killing eight people in a crowded bar in Puerto Rico was spared the death penalty and sentenced to life in prison on Saturday in only the fifth case in which prosecutors have sought capital punishment on the island. The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on a death sentence for Alexis Candelario Santana, 41, who was convicted by the same panel earlier this month for the socalled La Tombola killings of October 2009. The death penalty is banned under Puerto Rico’s constitution but applicable in certain federal cases. The island is U.S. territory and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Although there is strong opposition to the death penalty, crime has become a top public concern in Puerto Rico and the La Tombola killings were seen as particularly brazen and brutal. One of the people slain was a pregnant woman. Candelario would have been the first person put to death in Puerto Rico since 1927 and the first under the federal death penalty statute. He was convicted of being the mastermind and a participant of the shooting rampage, in which gunmen opened fire in the La Tombola bar in Toa Baja, a suburb west of San Juan. Authorities said the shootings were retaliation against the bar owner, who had taken control of local drug sales when Candelario was in prison. Candelario has been convicted for 10 other killings over the past decade in battles over the drug trade. Prosecutors say he has killed 22 people and attempted to kill another 19 in all. His case marked the fifth time federal prosecutors sought and failed to get the death penalty imposed in Puerto Rico. “I express my most profound respect to the jury for the decision it has taken. With it they have sustained the conviction of the Puerto Rican people that capital punishment should not be applied under any circumstances,” Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in a statement. The governor said he has asked U.S. Attorney Eric Holder not to certify any other federal case in Puerto Rico for the death penalty.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-deathpenalty-puertorico-idUSBRE92N02020130324,Reuters,Neutral
Santorum to Puerto Rico: Speak English if you want statehood,Reuters Staff,3/14/12,"Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum told Puerto Ricans on Wednesday they would have to make English their primary language if they want to pursue U.S. statehood, a statement at odds with the U.S. Constitution. Republican U.S. presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum speaks to supporters as his wife Karen (L) applauds at his Alabama and Mississippi primary election night rally in Lafayette, Louisiana, March 13, 2012. REUTERS/Jonathan BachmanSantorum traveled to the U.S. territory to campaign ahead of the island’s Republican primary election scheduled for Sunday, where he, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are vying for 20 delegates. Puerto Ricans, who recognize both English and Spanish as their official languages, are scheduled to vote in November on a referendum to decide whether they want to pursue statehood or remain a selfgoverning U.S. commonwealth. In an interview with El Vocero newspaper, Santorum said he supported Puerto Ricans’ right to selfdetermination regarding the island’s political status. “We need to work together and determine what type of relationship we want to develop,” he told the newspaper. But Santorum said he did not support a state in which English was not the primary language. “Like any other state, there has to be compliance with this and any other federal law,” Santorum said. “And that is that English has to be the principal language. There are other states with more than one language such as Hawaii but to be a state of the United States, English has to be the principal language. ”However, the U.S. Constitution does not designate an official language, nor is there a requirement that a territory adopt English as its primary language in order to become a state. Congress would have to give approval if Puerto Rico is to become the 51st state. Although Congress has considered numerous proposals to make English the official U.S. language, none has ever passed. However, some states have passed their own laws declaring English the official language, including heavily Hispanic Florida. Puerto Rico has about 4 million people and its population can vote in partisan primaries but not presidential elections. Puerto Ricans on the mainland have the same voting rights as other U.S. citizens. Santorum’s statement may fall flat with Puerto Rican Republicans, who have always argued that issues of language and culture should be controlled by state governments and not the federal government. It also could alienate the 4. 2 million Puerto Ricans who live on the U.S. mainland, including nearly 1 million in presidential swingstate Florida. Romney and Gingrich have both said Puerto Ricans must decide their future for themselves. Romney has said that if they choose to pursue statehood, he would help them achieve it. Romney, who is scheduled to travel to Puerto Rico on Friday and stay through the weekend, won the endorsement of Governor Luis Fortuno, who is also the head of Puerto Rico’s prostatehood New Progressive Party. Santorum was to meet with Fortuno on Wednesday before a town hall meeting with residents. He said he and Fortuno are friends because they went to the same church in Washington when Fortuno served as Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress from 20042008. Santorum also said that he does not support “at this time” allowing residents in territories like Puerto Rico to vote for president, although he said he was open to analyzing alternatives, such as allowing their votes to count in the popular vote but not in the Electoral College. Gingrich will send his daughter, Kathy Gingrich Lubbers, to campaign on his behalf in Puerto Rico on Thursday and Friday.

Puerto Rico is America’s Greece,No Author,3/8/12,"bligation municipal bond sale to $1. 7 billion from $1. 4 billion, demonstrating the voracious appetite that taxexempt investors have for higheryielding bonds. Unlike the debt of the 50 states, Puerto Rico’s municipal bonds are tax exempt for investors all over the U.S. This makes the debt especially attractive to wealthy investors in states with high personal income tax rates (think New York). But you have to wonder how many of these investors took the time to read the offering statement of the deal and run some numbers. October 6: Muniland snapsIf they had done the math, they likely would not be buying maturities that come due too far into the future, because it’s unlikely that Puerto Rico will be solvent enough to repay them. Puerto Rico is a Caribbean island with a simple, local economy that was supercharged by tax breaks the U.S. Congress granted it to promote manufacturing. The Center for the New Economy described Puerto Rico’s economy with a few quotes from Richard Weisskoff’s book Factories and Food Stamps: The Puerto Rico Model of Development:Puerto Rico was “the prototypical industrial colony, the archetypal case of the highest stage of development toward which many other Third World economies are moving. Its economy is open and dependent: open to both imports and exports; dependent on flows of foreign capital, government aid, and on the intangible methods, such as technology, consumption styles, and even wage levels for certain occupations. ”[. . . ]In that kind of an economy, both production and consumption are dominated by the foreign sector. The production of goods for export is dependent on “imported capital, imported investment, imported raw materials, imported technology, and imported spare parts. ” Thus, most of the income derived from the manufacturing and sale of exports accrues to and is repatriated by absentee owners, with little impact on the local economy. Puerto Rico could be described as America’s own Third World country. It has a per capita income of $15,203 — that’s less than half the level of the poorest state, Mississippi, where it’s $31,046 — and the official unemployment rate is 15. 5 percent. Fortyfive percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line, and 20 percent of personal income in the commonwealth comes from federal or Puerto Rican public funds. In short, it’s an economy going nowhere. But it’s Puerto Rico’s massive debt load that makes it resemble another crisisstricken country that’s been in the news lately: Greece. Although the commonwealth’s debt load is only 89 percent of its GDP, Puerto Rico’s underlying finances are weakening, and a big reason why it has balanced its budget so far is because it sold tax anticipation bonds and transferred the funds into the general fund. In 2011 public revenues were $8. 17 billion while expenditures were $9. 07 billion. This shortfall was plugged with official funds from the Cofina Stabilization Fund, a government subsidiary that sold bonds to be paid off with future sales tax revenues. The other way that Puerto Rico has been seeking to close its deficit is by selling public assets to private investors. In September 2011, Goldman Sachs and Albertis paid the government $1. 14 billion to lease two toll roads for a 40year concession. In August 2011, Puerto Rico got bids from 12 international consortiums for the island’s main transport hub, the Luiz Munoz Marin International Airport. There are plans afoot to privatize other public assets, including energy, publicschool infrastructure, transportation and water assets. But these hard asset sales will only provide a oneshot infusion of cash to fill a budget hole. There is only so much family silver to sell. Rating agencies placed Puerto Rico in the lowest tier of investment grade ratings: Moody’s rated it Baa1 with a negative outlook, S&P rated it BBB and Fitch rated it at BBB+. It’s not a giant concern to sophisticated investors if the rating slips into the junk category, but Puerto Rico’s borrowing costs will shoot up if that happens. Then the more dire question arises of what the government will do once it runs out of funds to cover pensions, social welfare funds, government payroll and debt service. As happened with Greece, bond investors continue to buy the debt assuming at some point the government will be bailed out by somebody, somewhere. Good bond investors know how to do financial calculations better than anyone.

Puerto Rico plans vote on territorial status,Reuters Staff,10/5/11,"Governor Luis Fortuno has proposed a twostep election next year to determine whether Puerto Ricans want to remain a U.S. territory.

The Caribbean island’s political parties alternately view the plebiscite as a step toward improving its economic future, a chance to shake off the vestiges of its colonial past, or a ploy by Fortuno to win a second term. Under legislation that Fortuno’s party introduced on Wednesday, voters would be asked on August 12, 2012, whether they want to change Puerto Rico’s political status. If the majority votes “yes,” a second ballot would ask them to choose among three nonterritorial options ,U.S. statehood, independence or sovereign free association. That question would be on the November 6, 2012, ballot, in which Fortuno is seeking a second fouryear term. If a majority votes “no” in August, no further step would be taken. Any change in Puerto Rico’s status would have to be approved by the U.S. Congress. “The island’s status is an issue that affects every aspect of our daily lives, including employment opportunities, health services, public safety, our children’s education and our very rights as citizens,” Fortuno said during an address broadcast Tuesday. Fortuno is a Republican and president of Puerto Rico’s New Progressive Party, which favors U.S. statehood for the island of nearly 4 million people. “The current status provides us with neither the means nor the powers that are needed to achieve the growth we need in the years ahead. That’s one thing we all agree on,” Fortuno said. The bill authorizing the plebiscite is expected to win approval in the legislature, where his party holds a majority. Applauding the plan, Juan Dalmau, secretary general of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, said in a radio interview that Puerto Rico needed to fight crime and improve its economy, problems he blamed on “the cancer of colonialism. ”But supporters of the Popular Democratic Party, which favors keeping Puerto Rico’s status as a U.S. commonwealth, called it a “smoke screen” aimed at hiding Fortuno’s record on crime and the economy, while whipping up statehood support that would boost his reelection bid. Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony for nearly 400 years, until Spain ceded it to the United States at the end of the SpanishAmerican war in 1898. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who pay into Social Security, receive federal welfare benefits and serve in the armed forces, but cannot vote in presidential elections and do not pay federal income tax. Puerto Ricans have voted to remain a U.S. commonwealth in past status votes, but the margin of victory has decreased over the years.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-status-idUSTRE7944ZV20111005,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico's police chief resigns as crime soars,Reuters Staff,7/2/11,"Puerto Rico’s top police official resigned Saturday as the U.S. Caribbean territory battles a crime wave with killings on pace to set a record this year. Police Superintendent Jose Figueroa Sancha, a 25year FBI veteran who took over the police department in January 2009, said he stepped down because of health reasons but acknowledged criticism over spiraling crime. “Regardless of the criticism that may come from politically motivated sectors, the development and future of the people of Puerto Rico will be closely related to the work being done by our police,” he said in statement. Figueroa Sancha’s resignation comes as Puerto Rico saw its deadliest month on record in June with 101 killings compared to 84 in June 1994, the second most violent on record, according to police statistics. Twentynine people were killed in one weekend alone. Last year, 955 killings were reported, just short of the island’s record of 995 in 1994. So far this year, 568 killings have been recorded. Much of the island’s violent crime is tied to the illegal drug trade. Law enforcement authorities say Puerto Rico is a favored trafficking route because of its status as a U.S. commonwealth. Once drugs reach the island, they can be smuggled to the U.S. mainland aboard airplanes or ships without having to pass through a U.S. customs checkpoint. Authorities say they are bracing for an increase in trafficking through the Caribbean after a crackdown on drug routes through Mexico.

"Obama returns to Puerto Rico, courting Hispanic vote",Alister Bull,6/14/11,"Barack Obama paid Puerto Rico its first official U.S. presidential visit in 50 years on Tuesday, courting an important slice of Hispanic voters on the mainland who could help his reelection chances in 2012. GM invests $7 billion to rival EV competitors Obama's historic trip to Puerto Rico01:52At an arrival ceremony in an aircraft hanger, Obama expressed support for an eventual decision by Puerto Ricans on the U.S. island territory’s status and said his administration was working to strengthen its recessionbattered economy. “When the people of Puerto Rico make a clear decision, my administration will stand by you,” he told a cheering crowd. “We’re giving Puerto Ricans the tools they need to build their own future,” the president said. “We are going to put people back to work here in Puerto Rico and all across America. ”Puerto Ricans are an important voting bloc in Florida, where they could help Obama balance out the Republicanleaning Cubans in this battleground state, which he won in 2008 and needs next year to help seal a second White House term. Thousands lined the route as the president drove to the governor’s mansion in the historic district of San Juan, passing crowds waving American flags as well as some signs demanding “Statehoood Now”. Some 4. 6 million Puerto Ricans live in the United States, where they can vote in presidential elections, outnumbering the 3. 9 million on the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, who can vote only in the presidential primary elections. This could be decisive next year in Florida, where Obama beat his Republican challenger John McCain in 2008 by over 200,000 votes, or 2. 5 percentage points, but where opinion polls show the state is now a tossup. Florida’s unemployment was 10. 8 percent in April, compared to a 9 percent national average that month, and Obama’s ability to connect with Puerto Ricans could prove vital. Many live around Orlando in Orange County in central Florida and were part of the wave who helped him last time. “No Democratic president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won Orange County until 2008 . . . I strongly believe it was the Puerto Rican vote that made it possible,” said Luis MartinezFernandez, a professor of history at the University of Central Florida, Orlando. The last U.S. president to set foot in Puerto Rico was Gerald Ford for a Group of Seven summit in 1976, which was not considered an official visit. Latinos backed Obama twoforone in 2008 but have been disappointed by his failure to deliver on the immigration reform that he promised during the 2008 campaign. Their continued support cannot be taken for granted, especially as they have been disproportionately hardhit by job losses.

“We’ve been trying to make sure that every family on the island can find work and make a living and provide for their children. That’s why our economic plan and our health care reform included help for Puerto Rico,” Obama said. After a ride that snaked through the narrow cobbled streets of old San Juan, Obama toured the governor’s mansion, built in 1533, before enjoying the view over San Juan Bay. He later ate lunch with a local opposition politician in a bakery two blocks from the beach, feasting on a local ham and cheese sandwich called a MediaNoche. GROWING VOTEPuerto Ricans are the secondlargest group within the 50. 5 million strong U.S. Hispanic community, after Mexicans. As a bloc, Hispanics represent 10 percent of all U.S. voters, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, but are the segment of the voter population that is growing at the fastest pace. In addition, because all Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who can vote if eligible, they are much easier to target for vital campaign organization and voterregistration drives. They are also an important presence in New York, Philadelphia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Georgia, and are growing in numbers in Ohio. “If the election is close, people could be pointing to this trip for creating outreach,” said Matt Barreto, a political science professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. Obama promised he would return to the island as president if he won while campaigning for 2008. His trip on Tuesday fulfilling that pledge is the first official presidential visit to Puerto Rico since President John F. Kennedy in 1961. His task force on Puerto Rico’s status included an examination on how to improve its economic conditions, as well as reviewing a longstanding question of whether it should stay a territory, become a full state or opt for independence. The task force took no position on this question but recommended all Puerto Ricans be allowed to express their will.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-campaign-obama-idUKTRE75931P20110614,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico hopes to gain from U.S. healthcare reform,Reuters Staff,9/24/09,"The national healthcare reform pushed by President Barack Obama seeks to provide coverage for every American citizen, but millions of people in Puerto Rico may be excluded from key aspects of the plan. With Obama having pledged to provide equal treatment for U.S. territories in federal programs, the commonwealth’s political leaders see the push for comprehensive healthcare reform as an opportunity to overturn spending caps and other regulations that have resulted in what they see as decades of discriminatory treatment in federal programs. There are growing doubts, however, about what benefits some 4. 5 million residents of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories would see under the healthcare reform legislation that emerges from a divided Congress. Critics say the version being drafted this week by the Senate Finance Committee, which is chaired by Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, would do nothing to overturn underfunding of Puerto Rico’s Medicaid and Medicare programs by an estimated $2. 8 billion annually. It would also leave residents out of an insurance exchange aimed at providing coverage through subsidies to the working poor. “The draft circulating isn’t acceptable because it wouldn’t allow the territories to provide universal health coverage,” said Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, the island’s sole nonvoting member of Congress. “It wouldn’t meet the president’s goal of making sure all Americans have access to adequate healthcare,” he said. For Governor Luis Fortuno, the island’s quest for parity in federal healthcare funding is “a civil rights issue. ”“The gross disparity in Medicare and Medicaid funding that Puerto Rico receives in comparison with the states is a historic injustice,” Fortuno told a gathering of the San Juan Rotary Club this week before heading to Washington for lobbying efforts. “DOLLARS AND CENTS”“It’s also a matter of dollars and cents for the government, with Puerto Rico picking up more than 80 percent of the healthcare costs of its poor versus the 20 percent or less for states with similar demographics, where the federal government picks up the balance of the cost,” Fortuno added. “The local health program that provides coverage to the island’s medically indigent has run up annual deficits of $350 million in recent years. ”“The government of Puerto Rico has had to take substantial sums to provide quality health services for our citizens,” the Republican governor added. The rationale for the disparity in treatment appears to be cost, which in Puerto Rico’s case amounts to about $2. 8 billion less annually in Medicare and Medicaid expenses than it would receive if it were treated as a state. Supporters of the current formula note that most residents of the U.S. commonwealth do not pay federal taxes. But proponents of a funding fix say that no Medicaid beneficiaries ,the country’s poorest residents ,pay taxes, and Medicare beneficiaries on the island pay the same taxes as stateside residents. “Our local government has been forced to carry a much larger economic burden than other states when we are talking about healthcare,” said Fortuno. “If the reform is necessary to control costs in the United States, it’s vital that Puerto Rico is included entirely in the efforts of Congress. ”Our Standards: The Thomson  Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-puertorico-idUSTRE58N5X320090924,Reuters,Neutral

Democrats take White House campaign to Puerto Rico,Jeff Mason,5/24/08,"Democratic White House candidates made rare campaign stops in Puerto Rico on Saturday as Hillary Clinton’s uphill challenge to secure the nomination was made even harder by controversy over her references to the 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy.

During a oneday stop on the largely Spanishspeaking island, frontrunner Barack Obama talked about veterans issues and his Republican rival Sen. John McCain before going on a paradestyle walk through San Juan. In his campaign events Obama made no mention of Clinton’s remarks from Friday when she cited the June 1968 assassination of presidential candidate Robert Kennedy to help explain why she was still in the race for the party’s nomination to contest McCain in the November election. “My husband (Bill Clinton) did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right? We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,” she told a South Dakota newspaper’s editorial board. Clinton’s comments drew a quick rebuke on Friday from Obama’s campaign and she apologized. Kennedy, brother of slain U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles just after winning the California Democratic primary. Obama, who has a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates, told a Puerto Rican radio station on Saturday he did not think Clinton intended any offence by her comments. “I have learned that when you are campaigning for as many months as Senator Clinton and I have been campaigning, sometimes you get careless in terms of the statements that you make and I think that is what happened here,” he said in an interview with Radio Isla Puerto Rico. There have long been concerns about the safety of Obama, who would be the first black U.S. president. The Illinois senator was given Secret Service protection 18 months before the November election ,earlier than any other candidate has received increased security. Clinton’s comment brought up the taboo topic of the possibility of a rival’s assassination, and political analysts said the remark was a serious gaffe. “This is serious. It’s more serious because there were already questions about why Hillary Clinton was still in the race and what she was hoping for,” said Calvin Jillson, political science professor at Southern Methodist University. Jillson said the comment indicates that perhaps Clinton is holding out because she thinks some catastrophe might happen. “What she articulated was the most catastrophic possibility,” he said. Jillson said the reference to Kennedy’s assassination makes the chance of Clinton being asked to be Obama’s vice presidential running mate even more unlikely. PUERTO RICO’S CLOUTAfter six months of contests that began in January, Clinton is lagging Obama but has refused to give up until the last votes are cast and counted. Clinton made no comments about Friday’s remarks before heading to Puerto Rico. She has one rally on Saturday and events on Sunday in the territory which is enjoying its moment in the political sun because of this year’s prolonged Democratic primary season. Fiftyfive delegates will be up for grabs in Puerto Rico’s June 1 vote, with Clinton favoured to win the bulk of them. The territory cannot vote in the November presidential election. The statebystate contests conclude on June 3, when 15 delegates will be awarded in South Dakota and 16 in Montana. Clinton will spend much of the rest of next week campaigning in those two states. The Democratic nominee will likely be decided by the nearly 800 superdelegates ,members of Congress and other party insiders ,who are free to vote for whomever they want. Most have endorsed Obama. Puerto Rico’s relationship with the United States is the central issue in the island’s politics. Both Clinton and Obama support allowing Puerto Ricans to decide for themselves whether they want to try for statehood or keep their current status. There are 3. 9 million residents on the island, which has a median income half that of the poorest U.S. state, and an almost equal number of Puerto Ricans live on the mainland.

Puerto Rico relishes clout as ballot battleground,John Marino,5/21/08,"The U.S. Caribbean territory of Puerto Rico can’t vote in the November presidential election. But Puerto Ricans are relishing a newfound clout in the race to see who will be the candidate of the Democratic party. The island’s June 1 primary is the biggest Democratic contest left, with 55 delegates at stake and perhaps giving Sen. Hillary Clinton a lastgasp opportunity to claim victory in the popular vote. The former first lady has performed strongly among Latinos. Sen. Barack Obama, who would be the first black U.S. president, has not fared that well in states with large Hispanic populations. While many mainland pundits do not believe Clinton can still beat Obama for the Democratic nomination, her supporters in Puerto Rico hope the unresolved votes of Florida and Michigan and a potential strong showing on the island could yet give her a chance. The primaries in Florida and Michigan were disqualified by the Democratic party to punish the states for bringing their dates forward without its approval. Clinton won both races, although Obama did not compete in Michigan, and is pushing for the primaries to be recognized in her favor. “It’s far from over,” said Roberto Prats, the cochair of the Clinton campaign in Puerto Rico, who estimated that a quarter of the island’s 4 million people could end up voting. Clinton is the favorite here. The one local poll conducted, taken between March 31 and April 5 by local firm Research & Research, showed Clinton with a 13point lead over Obama ,50 percent to 37 percent, with 13 percent still undecided. Clinton also has a fourtotwo lead among the island’s superdelegates, party officials who can support either candidate and may end up playing a decisive role at the Democrats’ nominating convention in August when a candidate is formally chosen to face Republican John McCain in the November election. Puerto Rico’s seventh superdelegate is neutral. “They have not counted Florida and Michigan yet. That could give her an edge. This is still a vital election,” said Michelle Kantrow, a 37yearold professional from the San Juan suburb of Carolina. But the Obama campaign has not given up on Puerto Rico. The senator from Illinois has nailed down a number of endorsements from local politicians, including the top Democratic leaders in the prostatehood New Progressive Party and procommonwealth Popular Democratic Party, the two main parties on the island. He also has a lead in public endorsements from island mayors, traditionally responsible for getting out the vote. One of Obama’s backers is Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vila, but the value of his support has likely diminished since he was indicted on March 27 on charges of campaign finance fraud. Obama’s ability to excite voters has been at work. “Obama has raised a lot of enthusiasm about changes in politics,” said Augusto Font, a 69yearold San Juan businessman. “It’s a whole new ballgame which is why it is so exciting and so many people are involved in the process. ”POSITIVE FOR ISLANDThe ultimate winner may be Puerto Rico itself. “It will be good for Puerto Rico because it will push our issues in the national forum,” said Teresa Lopez, a 50yearold artist and professor from the Santurce sector of San Juan. The issue of Puerto Rico’s status as a territory is important to some. The independence movement is currently small in Puerto Rico, but the population appears evenly divided between those happy with the island’s status quo as a commonwealth and those who want to be a fully fledged state. Clinton pledged to start resolving the status problem in her first term as a New York senator. “I think it is a fundamental question for any candidate. A colonial status is not right. It’s not even a question of good or bad. The intermediate status demoralizes society,” said Lopez, a Clinton supporter, who said a more aggressive stand on status by Obama could still sway her vote. But many voters in both camps say the more important issues are universal healthcare, the island’s ailing economy ,now in its third year of recession ,and public education, which have a more direct impact on their daily lives. Not everyone is enthused about the primary. Independence supporters have criticized the estimated $1. 5 million cost. And the poll taken last month found 24 percent of respondents were indifferent to U.S. mainland politics.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-puertorico-relish-idUKN1638635020080521,Reuters,Neutral
Puerto Rico seeks greater voice in Democratic race,John Marino,3/7/08,"Lured by the possibility of casting decisive votes in the White House race between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Democrats in Puerto Rico have decided to hold a full primary rather than a more casual, and less wellattended, caucus. The decision on Thursday night by Democrats on the U.S. island in the Caribbean, which does not actually get to vote in the presidential election itself in November, could prove to be a boost for Clinton, for Hispanic votes in primaries held so far have gone heavily for her. The change was prompted by the continued tightness of the battle between Obama and Clinton to represent the Democratic Party in the presidential ballot, party officials said. Local Democrats usually hold caucuses because the race is normally longdecided before the island votes, which will be on June 1. “Everybody was under the impression the vote would be over by February, but time has proved us wrong,” said attorney Roberto Prats, Puerto Rico’s Democratic Party chairman. A Democratic caucus would have entailed informal gatherings at eight different places, with votes being taken by supporters moving to different parts of the room. But in the primary, Puerto Ricans will be able to cast ballots at about 3,000 polling stations across the island in the privacy of a polling booth. Puerto Rican elections have among the highest voter participation rates in the world. With enthusiasm for this race expected to be especially high, party leaders felt a caucus would get chaotic, especially since local Democrats are split between those who support turning Puerto Rico into a U.S. state and those who want to maintain its commonwealth status. “We felt the eyes of the world would be on us, and we wanted to vote the way we are used to voting,” Prats said. Puerto Ricans won’t vote in the November elections, which are reserved for the 50 states. The territory will however be able to send 63 delegates to the nominating conventions that decide the parties’ presidential candidates. Those could prove decisive in the ClintonObama contest. “By May, both Obama and Clinton will be coming to Puerto Rico to begin campaigning,” said Puerto Rico Senate President Kenneth McClintock, a local Democratic Party official. “Having primaries will guarantee that we will be the focus of national politics. ”Clinton is wellknown in Puerto Rico. Under Bill Clinton’s administration, a big push for statehood was made in 1998 and a plan to end Navy training on Vieques island was instituted after a civilian security guard was killed by an errant bomb during war games in 1999. Clinton has also been active in Puerto Rico as a senator, and is expected to do so again in Puerto Rico. But Obama too has picked up support in Puerto Rico, including that of procommonwealth Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vila, who endorsed him in February.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-puertorico-idUSN0762582620080308,Reuters,Neutral
,No Author,,"The Democratic-controlled House on Friday passed a $20 billion-plus aid package for Puerto Rico, where a swarm of earthquakes last month set back the island territory’s slow, troubled recovery from the hurricane devastation of 2017. The legislation, approved by a mostly party-line  237-161 vote, would provide more than $5 billion in emergency appropriations, mostly for housing aid, rebuilding infrastructure, and repairing roads and bridges. It also includes $16 billion worth of tax breaks, mostly designed to extend refundable child tax credits for low-income families and to give the island’s residents equal access to an earned income tax credit for low-income earners. But the White House has promised to veto the legislation, charging the island’s government of mismanagement and weak financial controls. It arrives in the Senate as a dead letter anyway. Puerto Rico’s non-voting congressional delegate, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, a Republican, urged Democrats to look for common ground in hopes of getting agreement on an aid package the White House might accept. The Trump administration has been slow to release $44 billion in money that’s already been approved for Puerto Rico, stoking the ire of Democrats, who mounted a high-profile campaign to try to force the administration to release aid more quickly. A White House veto threat took note of huge balances of unspent aid.  “Over the last three years, we have allocated more than $40 billion for Puerto Rico disasters, and less than half of that has been spent,” said Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee. “And we have all seen recent press reports about warehouses in Puerto Rico full of water, diapers and food that have not been distributed to residents in need.” Democrats, however, see a double standard. Trump has trumpeted aid efforts to disaster-slammed states, especially in coastal southern GOP strongholds. But he has feuded with Democratic elected officials in Puerto Rico and has supported aid to the island after the urging of GOP office holders such as Florida GOP Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio,. “Don’t come here and say that ‘We have been there for Puerto Rico,’” said Rep. Nydia Velasquez, D-N.Y. “This administration has done everything within their power to withhold the money flowing to Puerto Rico.” The Puerto Rico aide issue is also infused with politics, as the population of Puerto Ricans on the mainland is growing while the island has steadily lost population during a long economic decline made worse by natural disasters. More than 200,000 residents of the U.S. commonwealth have relocated to Florida, New York and elsewhere. Friday’s debate exposed bipartisan frustration with the federal bureaucracy for disaster victims, particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency, over delays in aid to rebuild schools, hospitals, roads, and the island’s heavily damaged electrical grid.",https://apnews.com/ac3f114e02a41580240d1a76818dcc60,AP,Neutral
